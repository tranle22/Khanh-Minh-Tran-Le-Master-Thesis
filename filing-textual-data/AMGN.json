BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our and us) is the worlds largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We were incorporated in 1980 and organized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. Our public website is www.amgen.com. On our website, investors can find press releases, financial filings and other information about the Company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, www.sec.gov, also offers access to reports and documents Amgen has filed electronically with the SEC. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. As of December 31, 2009, we had 17,200 staff members worldwide. Approximately 6,600 of our staff members work in our research and development (RD) function; approximately 4,700 work in manufacturing; approximately 3,900 work in our commercial operations and the rest are in general and administrative functions. Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are: Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs) that stimulate the production of red blood cells; Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), a pegylated protein, based on the Filgrastim molecule, and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), both of which selectively stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection), and Enbrel  (etanercept), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a substance that plays a role in the bodys response to inflammatory diseases. Our principal products represented 93%, 94% and 95% of our sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our other marketed products include: Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), a small molecule calcimimetic that lowers serum calcium levels; Vectibix  (panitumumab), a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and Nplate  (romiplostim), a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that mimics endogenous TPO, the primary driver of platelet production. In addition to our marketed products, we have products in mid-to-late stage development in various therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone, nephrology and general medicine, which includes cardiology and neurology. Denosumab, our leading late-stage product candidate, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK), an essential regulator of osteoclasts (the cells that break down bone) that is under regulatory review and is being studied across a range of conditions. Our RD organization has expertise in multiple treatment modalities, including large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) and small molecules. We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada. We market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which influence demand. The reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment and in demonstrating the economic value of products. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky. Product development cycles are very long  approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market  and failure rates are high. A new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. Biotechnology products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Upon approval, marketed products in our industry  generally face substantial competition. Our industry is also highly regulated, and various U.S. and international regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we develop, manufacture and commercialize our products as well as conduct our business. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to assist in ensuring safety of therapeutic products, which may lead to fewer products being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, delays in receiving approvals or additional safety-related requirements or restrictions on the use of our products, including expanded safety labeling, required risk management activities, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), and/or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of post-marketing commitments (PMCs), post-marketing requirements (PMRs) or pharmacovigilance programs. Key Developments The following is a list of selected key developments that occurred during 2009 and early 2010 affecting our business, including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with certain of our marketed products and product candidates. A more detailed discussion of each key development follows in the appropriate sections. Denosumab ##TABLE_START    We received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on our biologics license application (BLA) for Prolia  in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) in women and bone loss in patients undergoing hormone ablation therapy (HALT) for either prostate or breast cancer. These Complete Response Letters requested additional information to support approval of the treatment of the PMO indication and the HALT indication, and requested a new clinical program to support approval of the prevention of the PMO indication. (The FDA has provisionally approved the trade name Prolia  in the indications noted above, for which the drug is administered twice yearly subcutaneously at a 60 milligram (mg) dose. The trade name is only for these indications and may not apply for other indications of denosumab.) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia  in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of July 25, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (formerly known as the EMEA) for marketing authorization for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We announced positive results from the following three phase 3 head-to-head trials evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  (zoledronic acid) in the treatment of bone metastases: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in patients with advanced breast cancer, in which denosumab was superior to Zometa  in delaying the time to the first skeletal-related event (SRE) and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors or multiple myeloma, in which denosumab was non-inferior to Zometa  in delaying the time to the first SRE, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in men with advanced prostate cancer, in which denosumab was superior to Zometa  in delaying the time to the first SRE and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs. ##TABLE_END These three studies will form the basis of the clinical evidence package for denosumab in advanced cancer, which will be submitted to regulatory authorities later in 2010.  ESAs ##TABLE_START    On February 16, 2010, we announced that the FDA approved a REMS program for our ESAs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We published detailed results from the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Endpoints with Aranesp  Therapy (TREAT) and updated the ESA labels to incorporate certain of the trial results regarding the increased risk of stroke and to reinforce the need to follow the approved label guidance to maintain appropriate hemoglobin (Hb) levels. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The FDA announced that it will call an advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and could consider lowering targeted Hb levels and reducing approved dosing for ESAs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has scheduled a Medicare Evidence Development  Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) meeting on March 24, 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which may consider the results of the TREAT study. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The CMS released its proposed rule to implement the bundled prospective payment system for end stage renal disease (ESRD), which could impact reimbursement for EPOGEN  . ##TABLE_END U.S. healthcare reform ##TABLE_START    Healthcare reform, focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and reducing the rate of increase in the costs of healthcare, remains a priority for President Obama, U.S. Congress and a number of states. Developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict. As recently as February 23, 2010, President Obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the Senate and House of Representatives bills passed in late 2009. Certain healthcare reform proposals being considered, which may or may not be adopted into law, could: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition; and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require additional healthcare reform costs be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. ##TABLE_END At this time, we cannot predict which or whether any reform measures will be adopted into law. Other pipeline developments ##TABLE_START    We announced detailed results from two key phase 3 trials evaluating Vectibix  as a first- and second-line treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We announced plans to initiate a phase 3 trial for AMG 386 in ovarian cancer. ##TABLE_END Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates We market our principal products, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and ENBREL, in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our products competitive position among other biologic and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price and reimbursement. Certain of our marketed products face, and our product candidates, if approved, are also expected to face, substantial competition from products marketed by large pharmaceutical corporations, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by  patents, or a reduction in the price we receive from selling our products. For example, we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars in the European Union (EU), which has an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars. In addition, lawmakers in the United States have proposed bills to create a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval of biosimilars and several companies have recently announced plans to pursue development of biosimilars in the United States. Further, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may require less use of our products, particularly in supportive cancer care, or limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition to challenges presented by competition, our existing products and product candidates are also subject to increasing regulatory compliance requirements which can be imposed as a condition of approval or after a product has been approved. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While these therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve a relatively new or higher level of scientific complexity and, therefore, generate increased safety concerns. For example, as a condition of approval or due to safety concerns after the product has been approved, we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or studies, such as observational epidemiological studies. Such trials or studies are called PMCs or PMRs. We currently have PMCs or PMRs for some of our marketed products. In addition, we may be required to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. This requirement, too, may be imposed as a condition of approval or after a product has been on the market. A REMS may include a medication guide or a patient package insert, a healthcare provider communication plan or other elements the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product. While the elements of a REMS may vary, all REMS are required to have a timetable for assessments. ESAs Aranesp  is our registered trademark for one of our ESAs, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count can result in anemia, a condition where insufficient oxygen is delivered to the bodys organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with chronic renal failure (CRF), both in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with non-myeloid malignancies. EPOGEN  is our other ESA and is our registered trademark for our recombinant human erythropoietin product, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. A reduced red blood cell count can result in anemia (see   Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) ). Individuals with CRF suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys. Our ESA products have and will continue to face challenges. For example, based on adverse safety results observed beginning in late 2006 in various ESA studies, performed by us and others, that explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label, the product labeling of our ESA products has been updated several times to reflect these safety concerns in the United States and the EU, including, most recently, label updates in the United States in August 2008 and in December 2009 to reflect certain results of our TREAT study, as discussed below. In addition, due in part to certain of these developments, reimbursement of our ESA products in the United States was also revised resulting in changes in the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, including by decreasing the number of treated patients, average dose and duration of ESA therapy. Certain of these developments have had a material adverse impact on sales of our ESA products, in particular Aranesp  sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. Further, we believe that certain of the following recent and pending developments could have a material adverse impact on the future sales of Aranesp  and EPOGEN  : ##TABLE_START    On February 16, 2010, Amgen and Centocor Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. (Centocor Ortho Biotech Products), a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson (JJ), announced that the FDA approved a REMS for ESAs which includes Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Procrit  (Epoetin alfa). The FDA has determined that a REMS is necessary for ESAs to ensure the benefits of these drugs outweigh the risks of shortened overall survival (OS) and/or increased tumor progression or recurrence as identified in clinical studies in ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid and cervical cancers. As part of the REMS, a medication guide explaining the risks and benefits of ESAs must be provided to all patients receiving ESAs. To ensure continued access to ESAs for healthcare providers who prescribe, or prescribe and dispense, ESAs to patients with cancer, providers are required to train and enroll in the ESA APPRISE (Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe use of ESAs) Oncology Program and to document that a discussion about the risks of ESAs took place with each patient prior to the initiation of each new course of ESA therapy. The ESA APPRISE Oncology Program will be launched on March 24, 2010. Direct patient registration or approval prior to ESA administration is not required through the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On December 16, 2009, after consultation with the FDA, Amgen and Centocor Ortho Biotech Products updated the safety information in the ESA product labeling to reflect certain results of our TREAT study. These changes include a revision to the BOXED WARNINGS section to include the increased risk of stroke and to reinforce the need to follow the approved label guidance to maintain Hb levels within the range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter (g/dL). (See discussion of Aranesp  TREAT study results in  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates. ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The FDA has announced that it will call an advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with CKD and could consider lowering targeted Hb levels and reducing approved dosing for ESAs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The CMS has scheduled a MEDCAC meeting for March 24, 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which may consider the results of the TREAT study. In February 2010, the CMS released the voting questions the MEDCAC will address, including whether the available evidence in both CKD not on dialysis and ESRD clearly (i) demonstrates benefits and risks of ESA therapy, (ii) supports a baseline Hb range or (iii) justifies a dose response or maximum dose. The CMS will decide whether more evidence is needed to determine whether ESA treatment is reasonable and necessary to support continued Medicare coverage. (See  Reimbursement. ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On September 15, 2009, the CMS released its proposed rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for ESRD, which becomes effective in 2011 and could impact EPOGEN  . (See  Reimbursement. ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We are working with the FDA to make ESA product package insert changes associated with the Physicians Labeling Rule (PLR) conversion process. During the process of converting from the existing format to the new PLR format, the FDA may evaluate the package insert information to ensure that it accurately reflects current knowledge and may revise, add to or remove information appearing in the old format that could substantively impact the content of the product package insert. ##TABLE_END In addition to the above, following the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting in May 2004, we proposed a pharmacovigilance program for Aranesp  comprised of five studies to explore the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label. These studies were subsequently designated by the FDA as PMCs. Of the five studies, one was sponsored by Amgen while the remaining four were investigator-sponsored. Results of certain of these studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESA products and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. Of the five studies, three are complete while final results of the other two are expected in 2010 or 2011. In addition, Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research  Development (JJPRD), a subsidiary of JJ, and/or its investigators have conducted numerous studies proposed at the 2004 ODAC meeting. All of these studies are closed to enrollment and summary results were submitted to the FDA. In addition, JJPRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study in breast cancer is ongoing and is designated as a FDA PMC. Based on our ongoing discussions with the FDA in response to the May 2007 ODAC meeting, we and JJPRD have carefully considered potential new study designs to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Based on these discussions, we have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3  non-inferiority study evaluating OS when comparing advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo (Study 782) as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. Adverse events or results of any of these studies could further affect product safety labeling, healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and/or reimbursement practices related to Aranesp  . Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license by Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (KA), a joint venture between Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin) and Amgen (see  Business Relationships  Kirin Holdings Company, Limited ), to manufacture and market Aranesp  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We market Aranesp  primarily in the United States and Europe. Aranesp  was initially launched in 2001 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF (both in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Worldwide Aranesp  sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $2.65 billion, $3.14 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, U.S. Aranesp  sales were $1.25 billion, $1.65 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively and international Aranesp  sales were $1.40 billion, $1.49 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for darbepoetin alfa are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins  5/15/2024 Europe (1)  Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins  10/12/2010 Europe (1)  Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins  8/16/2014 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) In some cases, these European patents may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Our principal European patent relating to Epoetin alfa expired on December 12, 2004. Although we do not market EPOGEN  in Europe, upon expiration of this patent, some companies have received approval to market biosimilars or other products that compete with Aranesp  in Europe, presenting additional competition, as further discussed below.  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy and renal failure could negatively impact product sales of Aranesp  . The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Aranesp  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care and nephrology segments, unless otherwise indicated. The table and discussion below of competitor marketed products and potential products may not be exhaustive. ##TABLE_START Territory  Competitor Marketed Product  Competitor U.S.  PROCRIT  (1)  Centocor Ortho Biotech Products (2) Europe  EPREX  /ERYPO   Janssen-Cilag (2) Europe  NeoRecormon   F.

In addition to competition from the above-noted marketed products, the following product candidates could compete with Aranesp  in the future. Affymax Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) are co-developing Hematide  , an ESA for the treatment of anemia in renal patients and they have announced plans to file for regulatory approval in 2010. FibroGen Inc. is developing FG-2216 and FG-4592, orally active ESAs, for the treatment of anemia and is also studying FG-4592 for the treatment in anemia of CKD. Additionally, in December 2008, Merck  Company, Inc. (Merck) announced the formation of a new biotech division, Merck Bioventures, which is developing a late-stage pegylated ESA (MK-2578), which they have announced they expect to launch in 2012. EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market EPOGEN  in the United States under a licensing agreement with KA. We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a subsidiary of JJ (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Centocor Ortho Biotech Products), a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis (see  Business Relationships  Johnson  Johnson ). We launched EPOGEN  in the United States in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF for patients who are on dialysis. We market EPOGEN  in the United States for the treatment of anemic adult and pediatric patients with CRF who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is indicated for elevating or maintaining the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or Hb measurements) and decreasing the need for blood transfusions in these patients. EPOGEN  sales in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.  Our outstanding material patents for Epoetin alfa are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Process of making erythropoietin  8/15/2012 U.S.  Product claims to erythropoietin  8/20/2013 U.S.  Pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin  8/20/2013 U.S.  Cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin  5/26/2015 ##TABLE_END Amgen and Roche reached a settlement of litigation in December 2009, and on December 22, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Roche prohibiting Roche from infringing our patents. The judgment was accompanied by Roches admission that our five patents involved in the lawsuit are valid, enforceable and infringed by Roches Peg-EPO, and by us allowing Roche to begin selling Peg-EPO in the United States in mid-2014 under terms of a limited license agreement. Peg-EPO has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with CRF could negatively impact product sales of EPOGEN  . In the United States, as noted above, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. In addition, EPOGEN  could face additional competition in the United States from those product candidates noted in the Aranesp  section above that may be used in dialysis. Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) Neulasta  is our registered trademark for a pegylated protein, based on the Filgrastim molecule, that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils. Neutrophils defend against infection. NEUPOGEN  is our registered trademark for our recombinant-methionyl human G-CSF, a protein that selectively stimulates production of neutrophils. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. Very often, neutropenia is the dose limiting side effect of chemotherapy and can thus be responsible for a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy that can be administered safely. Such reductions in chemotherapy dose can compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy on the cancer it is being used to treat, with the result of a higher treatment failure rate. As mentioned above, the pegfilgrastim molecule is based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule (PEG) is added to enlarge the Filgrastim molecule, thereby extending its half-life and causing it to be removed more slowly from the body. Because pegfilgrastim is eliminated through binding to its receptor on neutrophils and their precursors, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN  , which requires more frequent dosing. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  are prescribed more frequently in the curative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered with the intent to cure cancer, rather than in the palliative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered to treat other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth. We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with KA (see Business Relationships  Kirin Holdings Company, Limited ). We market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  primarily in the United States and Europe. Filgrastim is also marketed under the brand name GRANULOKINE  in Italy. Neulasta  was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Administration of Neulasta  in all cycles of chemotherapy is approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with at least a 17% risk of febrile neutropenia. NEUPOGEN  was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN  is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for  patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy; reducing the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; reducing the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in cancer patients who have undergone myeloablative chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation; and reducing the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Worldwide Neulasta  sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $3.4 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009 were $1.3 billion. Our outstanding material patents for pegfilgrastim are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Pegylated G-CSF  10/20/2015 Europe (1)  Pegylated G-CSF  2/8/2015 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Our outstanding material patents for Filgrastim are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  G-CSF polypeptides  12/3/2013 U.S.  Methods of treatment using G-CSF polypeptides  12/10/2013 ##TABLE_END Our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expired on August 22, 2006. Upon expiration of this patent, some companies have received approval to market biosimilar products that compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in Europe, presenting additional competition, as further discussed below. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  could face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, severe chronic neutropenia and AML. NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe. U.S. and international NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  . However, we believe that the conversion in the United States is substantially complete and that a significant amount of the conversion in Europe had already occurred. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care setting. The table and discussion below of competitor marketed products and potential competitor products may not be exhaustive. ##TABLE_START Territory  Competitor Marketed Product  Competitor U.S.  Leukine   Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Europe  Granocyte   Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd./Sanofi-Aventis Europe  Ratiograstim  (1) /Filgrastim Ratiopharm  (1)  Ratiopharm GmbH Europe  Biograstim  (1)  CT Arztneimittel Europe  Tevagrastim  (1)  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

XM02 is already  being sold under the brand name Tevagrastim  in several European countries. If approved in the United States, this drug could compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . On November 30, 2009, Teva Pharmaceutical filed a declaratory judgment action against us alleging that certain of our NEUPOGEN  patents are invalid and not infringed by Teva Pharmaceuticals XM02 and on January 15, 2010, we filed an answer and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that our patents are valid and infringed. (See Note 20,  Contingencies and commitments  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) In addition, in September 2009, Hospira announced it acquired worldwide rights to a biogeneric version of Filgrastim from Teva Pharmaceutical. If approved in Europe, this drug could compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . Enbrel  (etanercept) ENBREL is our registered trademark for our TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to its receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune systems ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL is similar to a protein that the body produces naturally, and like this protein, it binds certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation. We acquired the rights to ENBREL in July 2002 with our acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex). We market ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada (see  Business Relationships  Pfizer Inc. ). The rights to market and sell ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. ENBREL was initially launched in November 1998 by Immunex for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, ENBREL is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: moderately to severely active RA; chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis. ENBREL is also approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idopathic arthritis in patients ages 2 and older. ENBREL sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patent for etanercept is described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  TNFR DNA vectors, cells and processes for making proteins  10/23/2012 ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating rheumatology, which includes moderate to severe RA, moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis; and dermatology, which includes moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, could negatively impact product sales of ENBREL. Current treatments for these indications include generic methotrexate and other products, as further discussed below.

Abbott has announced that they are planning to submit this indication for regulatory approval in 2010. In addition, a number of companies have JAK kinase inhibitors in development for RA, including Pfizer and Incyte Corporation. Other Our other marketed products are principally comprised of Sensipar  (cinacalcet), Vectibix  (panitumumab) and Nplate  (romiplostim). Sensipar  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  is our registered trademark in the United States and Mimpara  is our registered trademark in Europe for our first small molecule medicine used in treating CKD patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. In 2004, Sensipar  /Mimpara  was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In 2008, Mimpara  was approved in Europe (through an extension of the marketing authorization for Mimpara  ) for the reduction of hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism where a parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. We market Sensipar  /Mimpara  primarily in the United States and Europe. Worldwide Sensipar  sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $651 million, $597 million and $463 million, respectively. On September 15, 2009, the CMS released its proposed rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for ESRD. The proposed rule also includes in the bundled payment oral drugs that are not equivalent to separately billable Part B drugs, which could impact reimbursement for Sensipar  .

(Barr) for infringement of four Sensipar  patents. The lawsuit is based on the Abbreviated New Drug Application filed by Teva and Barr which seeks approval to market generic versions of Sensipar  . (See Note 20,  Contingencies and commitments  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) These generic versions could compete with Sensipar  in the future. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is our registered trademark for our first fully human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens. EGFr is a protein that plays an important role in cancer cell signaling and is over-expressed in many human cancers. Vectibix  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to EGFrs and interferes with signals that might otherwise stimulate growth and survival of the cancer cell. The goal of developing fully human monoclonal antibodies is to offer effective targeted therapies with lessened risk of immune response against these agents. We acquired full ownership of Vectibix  with our acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. (Abgenix) in April 2006 and Vectibix  received FDA approval in September 2006. In the EU, the conditional approval of Vectibix  as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens was received in December 2007 and is reviewed annually by the CHMP. In December 2008 and 2009, the conditional marketing authorization was renewed with an additional specific obligation to conduct a clinical trial in the existing approved indication. In 2009, the CHMP approved the protocol for this additional  clinical trial which will compare the effect of Vectibix  versus Erbitux  (cetuximab) on OS for chemorefractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors. Worldwide Vectibix  sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $233 million, $153 million and $170 million, respectively. In July 2009, we announced that the FDA approved certain revisions to the U.S. prescribing information (PI) for the EGFr class of antibodies, including Vectibix  . The INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the PI has been updated to include that retrospective subset analyses of mCRC trials have not shown a treatment benefit for Vectibix  in patients whose tumors had KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13 and that use of Vectibix  is not recommended for the treatment of colorectal cancer with these mutations. The CLINICAL STUDIES section of the PI has been updated to reflect results from retrospective analyses across seven randomized clinical trials with agents in this class. This includes the first phase 3 analysis that showed mCRC patients with mutated KRAS tumors do not respond to monotherapy with an EGFr-inhibiting antibody (the Vectibix  408 trial). This decision follows the FDAs December 2008 ODAC meeting where the clinical utility of the KRAS gene as a predictive biomarker in patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFr antibody was discussed. In 2009, we announced that the primary endpoint of extending progression-free survival (PFS) was met in the phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Vectibix  in combination with FOLFOX as a first-line treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, while the secondary endpoint of OS was not met. In patients with mutated KRAS , PFS was significantly inferior for patients who received Vectibix  as compared to patients that did not receive Vectibix  . We also announced in 2009 that the co-primary endpoint of extending PFS was met in the phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Vectibix  in combination with FOLFIRI as compared to patients who received FOLFIRI alone as a second line treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, while the co-primary endpoint of OS was not met. In patients with mutated KRAS , no difference was seen in PFS for patients who received Vectibix  as compared to patients that did not receive Vectibix  . For more information, see  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.  Based on the results of these studies, we are planning to file for regulatory approval in the United States and EU for first- and second- line treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. Our outstanding material patents for panitumumab are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Human monoclonal antibodies EGFr  4/8/2020 Europe  Human monoclonal antibodies EGFr  12/4/2022 ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens could negatively impact product sales for Vectibix  .

Nplate  , the first FDA approved peptibody protein, works by raising and sustaining platelet counts. We were granted an exclusive license by KA to manufacture and market Nplate  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In February 2009, we announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Nplate  for the treatment of splenectomized adult chronic ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). In the EU, Nplate  may  also be considered as second-line treatment for adult non-splenectomized ITP patients where surgery is contraindicated. Worldwide Nplate  sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $110 million and $17 million, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for romiplostim are described in the table below. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S. (1)  Thrombopoietic compounds  10/22/2019 Europe (2)  Thrombopoietic compounds  10/22/2019 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) An application for patent term extension has been submitted and is currently pending in the United States. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END We currently have an approved REMS for Nplate  , which includes a medication guide, a healthcare provider communication plan and certain elements to ensure safe use (including restricted distribution, registry and healthcare provider and patient enrollment). Promacta  , GlaxoSmithKline plcs (GSK) registered trademark in the United States, is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy, and competes with Nplate  . In December 2009, Revolade  , GSKs proposed registered trademark in Europe, received a positive opinion from the CHMP for marketing authorization for the treatment of adult chronic ITP splenectomized patients who are refractory to other treatments, and may compete with Nplate  in the EU, if approved by the European Commission. Product candidates We are currently studying new product candidates, including denosumab, and currently marketed products for new indications, which, if approved, we expect will enter into highly competitive markets. If successful, these product candidates will face substantial competition from products currently marketed as well as those under development by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Denosumab Developments Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is an essential regulator of osteoclasts. Denosumab is under regulatory review and is being studied across a range of conditions, including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone metastases, multiple myeloma and RA. The following is a summary of certain key developments that occurred in 2009 and early 2010 with respect to denosumab: Prolia  (denosumab) for the Prevention and Treatment of PMO and the Prevention and Treatment of Bone Loss in Patients Undergoing HALT for either Prostate Cancer or Breast Cancer In late 2008, we submitted the BLA to the FDA for Prolia  in the treatment and prevention of PMO in women and bone loss in patients undergoing HALT for either prostate or breast cancer. On August 13, 2009, we announced the results of our meeting with the FDAs Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs (ACRHD) to review the potential use of Prolia  for the treatment and prevention of PMO in women and the treatment and prevention of bone loss in patients undergoing HALT for either prostate cancer or breast cancer. The Committee recommended approval of Prolia  for the treatment of PMO and for the treatment of bone loss in patients undergoing HALT for prostate cancer. The Committee recommended against approval of Prolia  to treat or prevent bone loss in women with breast cancer undergoing HALT until additional data are available. The Committee also recommended against approval of Prolia  to prevent bone loss in  low-risk patients in all three populations. Finally, the Committee recommended that Prolia  have a REMS. The ACRHD is an advisory committee of external experts who advise the FDA about the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drugs for use in the practice of obstetrics, gynecology and related specialties. This committee is advisory only and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by their recommendations. In October 2009, the FDA issued Complete Response Letters for our BLA for Prolia  for the above-noted indications. The FDA issues Complete Response Letters to request additional information needed to complete the review of applications for product approval. The Complete Response Letter related to the Prolia  application for the treatment and prevention of PMO in women requested several items, including further information on the design and background adverse event rates that will inform the methodology of our previously submitted post-marketing surveillance program, although the letter did not require additional pre-marketing clinical trials to complete the review of the treatment indication. The FDA has also requested a new clinical program to support approval of Prolia  for the prevention of PMO indication. In addition, the FDA has determined that a REMS is necessary for Prolia  and must include a medication guide and a healthcare provider communication plan. The FDA acknowledged receipt of our previously submitted proposed REMS materials. The FDA also requested all updated safety data related to Prolia  . On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia  in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. The Complete Response Letter related to the Prolia  HALT application requested additional information regarding the safety of Prolia  in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy and patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Specifically, the FDA has requested results from additional adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating that Prolia  has no detrimental effects on either time-to-disease progression or OS. We continue to work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps regarding our application for the HALT indication. Prolia  Received Positive Opinion from CHMP in the EU In December 2009, the CHMP announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. If approved by the European Commission, we would receive marketing authorization for Prolia  in all EU Member States. The timing of actual launch dates would vary by country based on reimbursement authority approval of pricing which could follow the EMA approval by many months. While the European Commission generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. Prolia  is also under regulatory review in Switzerland, Australia and Canada for the treatment and prevention of PMO and the treatment of bone loss in patients undergoing HALT for breast and prostate cancer. We are working closely with regulatory agencies in each of these countries. Denosumab Phase 3 Bone Metastases Clinical Trials In 2009, we announced that the phase 3 head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  in the treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in time to first SRE and its secondary endpoints (superiority compared to Zometa  for both delaying the time to the first on-study SRE and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs). We also announced that the phase 3 head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  in the treatment of bone metastases in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors (not including breast and prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in time to first SRE. On February 8, 2010, we announced that the phase 3 head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  in the treatment of bone metastases in advanced cancer patients with prostate cancer met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in time to first SRE and its secondary endpoints (superiority compared to Zometa  for both delaying the time to the first on-study SRE and delaying  the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs). These three studies will form the basis of the clinical evidence package for denosumab in advanced cancer, which will be submitted to regulatory authorities later in 2010.

We market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, and also through the Internet. In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat, as well as providing support to various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas. In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. We utilize these wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. In early 2008, ENBRELs distribution model was converted from primarily being shipped directly to pharmacies to a wholesale distribution model similar to our other products. In Europe, Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  are principally sold to healthcare providers and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate.  We had product sales to three large wholesaler customers each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for 71% and 88% of worldwide gross revenues and U.S. gross product sales, respectively, for 2009, as noted in the following table (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,   2009  2008  2007 AmerisourceBergen Corporation:    Gross product sales  $ 7,179  $ 7,099  $ 6,124 % of total gross revenues   37%   37%   31% % of U.S. gross product sales   46%   46%   39% McKesson Corporation:    Gross product sales  $ 3,694  $ 3,594  $ 2,398 % of total gross revenues   19%   19%   12% % of U.S. gross product sales   24%   23%   15% Cardinal Health, Inc.:    Gross product sales  $ 2,841  $ 2,823  $ 2,715 % of total gross revenues   15%   15%   14% % of U.S. gross product sales   18%   18%   17% ##TABLE_END We have entered into certain co-promotion agreements to market our products in certain geographic areas. These agreements generally require us to share profits on product sales. Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Pfizer market ENBREL in the United States and Canada for all approved indications. Under a co-promotion agreement with GSK, we and GSK will commercialize Amgens Prolia  in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, and GSK will commercialize denosumab, for all indications in countries where we do not currently have a commercial presence (see  Business Relationships  GlaxoSmithKline plc ). Additionally, we have entered into agreements with third-parties to market certain of our products, including Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in certain geographic areas outside of the United States and to assist in marketing ENBREL in the United States. In addition, we have granted JJ a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis (see  Business Relationships  Johnson  Johnson ). We have also granted Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) a license to develop and commercialize denosumab in Japan in PMO, oncology and certain other indications (see  Business Relationships  Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited ). See  Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion  for a discussion of the government regulation over product marketing and promotion. Reimbursement Sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. Most patients receiving our products are covered by government healthcare programs or private insurers. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may adopt or be influenced by government coverage and reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. An increasing worldwide focus on patient access controls and cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our products. In addition, we believe that ongoing healthcare reform efforts will include long-term changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products which may have a significant impact on our business. U.S. Reimbursement System Our principal products are predominantly sold in the United States and healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals and other healthcare professionals and providers are reimbursed for their services by the  government through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers. Government healthcare programs are funded primarily through the payment of taxes from individuals and businesses. The public and private components of this multi-payer system are described below. Medicare and Other Forms of Public Health Insurance Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities and ESRD, regardless of their age. The primary Medicare programs that affect reimbursement for our products are Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and outpatient care, and Medicare Part D, which provides a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare (as well as Medicaid, described below) and, among its responsibilities, has authority to issue Medicare national coverage decisions (NCD) as well as manual policy issuances and updates and codes for drugs and other items. Local Medicare contractors have authority to issue Local Coverage Determinations. Generally, a NCD issued by CMS is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage for a specific medical item or service. Medicare Part B Coverage of Drugs and ESRD. Medicare Part B provides limited coverage of outpatient drugs and biologicals that are furnished incident to a physicians services. Generally, incident to drugs and biologicals are covered only if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that is not usually self-administered by the patient and they are reasonable and necessary for a medically accepted diagnosis or treatment. Medicare Part B also covers some drugs pursuant to a specific statutory directive, such as blood-clotting factors and certain immunosuppressive drugs, erythropoietin and certain oral cancer drugs, if they fall under a specific statutory benefit category and they are safe and effective as established by FDA approval. Many of our principal products, including EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  , are currently covered under Medicare Part B (as well as other government healthcare programs). In addition, most patients with ESRD, regardless of age, are eligible for coverage of dialysis treatment through the ESRD Program under Medicare Part B, the primary payer for dialysis treatment. Because Medicare Part B is the primary payer for dialysis treatment, reimbursement for products, such as EPOGEN  , that are typically administered in dialysis centers and other settings is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement policy. Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit for Medicare eligible beneficiaries. This coverage is available through various private plans that provide insurance coverage for prescription drugs for a monthly premium. The list of prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D plans varies by plan, but drug lists maintained by individual plans must cover certain classes of drugs and biologicals, specifically the statute stipulates that Part D plans have at least two drugs in each unique therapeutic category, subject to certain exceptions. Medicare patients who obtain ENBREL and Sensipar  under retail coverage, where they are primarily provided, are typically covered by Medicare Part D. Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by individual states for low-income and disabled eligible beneficiaries. CMS also has responsibility for federal administration of the Medicaid program. Under federal law, states must cover low-income adults and children, pregnant women, disabled individuals and seniors, and states have the option of expanding eligibility beyond these groups of beneficiaries. Medicaid is financed jointly by the states and federal government through taxes. Medicaid offers a broad set of benefits, including prescription drugs. Medicaid includes the Drug Rebate Program which requires manufacturers to provide rebates to the states for our products covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. (See  Government Regulation  and Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers .) Private Health Insurance Employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance represents the main pathway by which Americans receive private health insurance. Many employers provide health insurance as part of the benefits package for employees. Insurance plans are administered by private companies, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and some companies are self-insured (i.e., they pay for all healthcare costs incurred by employees directly through a plan administered by a third party). Generally, employer-sponsored insurance premiums are paid primarily by employers and secondarily by employees.  Individual market. The individual market covers part of the population that is self-employed or retired. In addition, it covers some people who are unable to obtain insurance through their employer. In contrast to the employer-sponsored insurance, the individual market allows health insurance companies to deny people coverage based on pre-existing conditions although a newly enacted law prohibits denial of coverage based on genetic discrimination. The plans are administered by private insurance companies. Individuals pay an out-of-pocket insurance premium for coverage and benefits vary widely according to plan specifications. Reimbursement of Our Principal Products Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . Medicare and Medicaid payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. The Medicare program covers Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  , under Part B, when administered in the physician clinic setting and the hospital outpatient and dialysis settings and reimburses providers using a payment methodology based on a fixed percentage of each products average sales price (ASP). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current Period) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. In the calculation of ASP, CMS currently allows manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices and in the future CMS may provide more specific guidance. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, dialysis facility or hospital outpatient setting. Our ASP calculations are reviewed quarterly for completeness and based on such review, we have on occasion restated our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. (See  Items 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers .) Since January 1, 2005, in the physician office setting under Part B, our products have been reimbursed at 106% of its ASP (sometimes referred to as ASP+6%). As of January 1, 2009, Medicare payment in the hospital outpatient setting reimbursed each product ASP+4% which is lower than the payment rate was in 2008 (ASP+5%) or from 2006-2007 (ASP+6%). In 2010, the payment methodologies in both the hospital outpatient and physician office settings are at the same levels from 2009 (ASP+6% in the physician office setting and ASP+4% in the hospital outpatient setting), pursuant to the 2010 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule and the 2010 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment Final Rule. CMS has the regulatory authority to further adjust the outpatient hospital payment formula in future years. The extent to which commercial payers adopt the use of ASP as a payment methodology is still evolving and is often based on the relationship between the provider and the insurer. Dialysis Reimbursement. Currently, dialysis providers in the United States are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN  by Medicare through the ESRD Program. The ESRD Program reimburses Medicare providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement methodology is established by federal law and is implemented by CMS. Medicare reimburses for separately billable dialysis drugs administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN  and Aranesp  , at ASP+6%, using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On July 15, 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (the MIPPA) became law and contained a number of Medicare and Medicaid reforms, including a broader payment bundle for dialysis services and drugs which will require CMS, beginning in 2011, to establish a bundled Medicare payment rate that includes dialysis services and drug/labs that are currently separately billed. On September 15, 2009, CMS released its proposed rule to implement the bundled prospective payment system for ESRD. Under the proposed rule, the bundled payment system will include dialysis services covered under the current composite rate, as well as drugs and biologicals furnished for treatment of ESRD that are currently billed separately, including ESAs, intravenous iron and intravenous vitamin D, as well as oral equivalent forms of these intravenous drugs. In addition, the proposed rule also includes in the bundled payment oral drugs that are not equivalent to separately billable Part B drugs, specifically Sensipar  and phosphate binders. The public  comment period ended on December 16, 2009. The bundled reimbursement rate will be phased in over a four year period in equal increments starting in 2011. Providers have the option to move to a full Medicare bundled payment system in 2011 or may elect to adopt certain components of the bundled payment system beginning in 2010. CMS will also be required to establish a quality incentive program that begins concurrently with bundling in 2011. Beginning in 2012, facilities would be subject to up to a 2% annual reduction in Medicare reimbursement for failure to meet or exceed CMS quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy. Bundling initiatives that have been implemented in other healthcare settings have occasionally resulted in lower utilization of services that had not previously been a part of the bundled payment. ESA Reimbursement Developments. Since April 1, 2006, Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has been subject to a revised Erythropoietin Monitoring Policy (EMP), the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN  and Aranesp  utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The EMP was revised, effective January 1, 2008, requiring a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patients Hb is above 13 g/dL for three or more consecutive months. In addition, the revised EMP reduces the monthly dosing limits to 400,000 international units (IUs) of EPOGEN  , from 500,000 IUs, and to 1,200 micrograms (mcgs) of Aranesp  , from 1,500 mcgs. On March 14, 2007, CMS announced a review of all Medicare policies related to the administration of ESAs in non-renal disease applications as part of a national coverage analysis (NCA), which is generally CMS first step toward developing a NCD. Subsequently, on May 14, 2007, CMS issued a proposed NCD that was open for public comment through June 13, 2007. On July 30, 2007, CMS issued a NCD which was substantially altered from the proposed NCD. On January 14, 2008, CMS issued changes to its Medicare NCD Manual, adding the ESA NCD, effective for claims with dates of service on and after July 30, 2007 with an implementation date of April 7, 2008. The NCD determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions, and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. We believe that the restrictions in the NCD changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy. We believe this restriction on coverage of ESAs in the NCD has had a material adverse effect on the coverage, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , and our business and results of operations. In addition, many private payers have implemented portions of the NCD and we believe many healthcare providers have reduced ESA utilization for all of their patients regardless of insurance coverage. On September 11, 2007, the FDA held a joint meeting of the Cardiovascular-Renal Drug Advisory Committee (CRDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSaRMAC) to evaluate the safety data on ESA use in renal disease. On July 31, 2008, CMS issued a listing of potential topics for future NCDs as a step to increase transparency in the NCD process, which included as potential topics the use of ESAs in ESRD and CKD. CMS has not announced whether it will proceed to a NCD for ESAs in ESRD or CKD and we cannot predict whether ESAs in the renal setting will be the subject of a future NCD, however, any final NCD for ESAs in the renal setting, which may include non-coverage and/or new dosing and treatment restrictions similar to those in the NCD for treatment of anemia in oncology with ESAs, would negatively affect use, reduce coverage and reimbursement, negatively affect product sales of our ESA products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the CMS has scheduled a meeting on March 24, 2010 of the MEDCAC to review the available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which may consider the results of the TREAT study. In February 2010, the CMS released the voting questions the MEDCAC will address, including whether the available evidence in both CKD not on dialysis and ESRD clearly (i) demonstrates benefits and risks of ESA therapy, (ii) supports a baseline Hb range or (iii) justifies a dose response or maximum dose. The CMS will decide whether more evidence is needed to determine whether ESA treatment is reasonable and necessary to support continued Medicare coverage. The CMS may consider initiating a NCA or a NCD following the MEDCAC. While the MEDCAC provides advice and recommendations to CMS about the adequacy of scientific evidence and votes on certain questions proposed by CMS, it functions as an independent advisory body and its advice and recommendations to CMS are advisory only.  Enbrel  Reimbursement. The majority of prescription claims for ENBREL are paid through private insurance companies. Under Medicare, ENBREL is reimbursed through the Part D program, although less then 10% of all ENBREL U.S. prescriptions are reimbursed by Medicare. Healthcare Reform. Healthcare reform, focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and reducing the rate of increase in the costs of healthcare, remains a priority for President Obama, U.S. Congress and a number of states. Developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict. As recently as February 23, 2010, President Obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the Senate and House of Representatives bills passed in late 2009. Certain healthcare reform proposals being considered, which may or may not be adopted into law, could: ##TABLE_START    restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require additional healthcare reform costs to be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. ##TABLE_END At this time, we cannot predict which or whether any reform measures will be adopted into law. Reimbursement Outside the United States Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system has traditionally been the primary payer for all healthcare costs, including payment for drugs and biologicals. Over the past several years, the reimbursement environment in Europe has become very challenging, with the advent of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations (e.g., National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom) that make recommendations and/or determinations of coverage and reimbursement based upon both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product. Although the methods employed by different HTA agencies differ from country to country, the use of formal economic metrics has been increasing across Europe as well as in several emerging markets throughout the world. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. In some countries, international price referencing is the primary mechanism for price control in which the ceiling price of a pharmaceutical or biological product is set based to the price in particular benchmark countries. These price referencing rules are increasing in complexity as prices are more transparent and payers seek lower-price benchmarks against which to compare themselves. Additional cost-containment measures can include therapeutic reference pricing, including setting the reimbursement rate for a given class of agents at the lowest price within the class, generic substitution and government-mandated price cuts. In many countries, the influence of regional and hospital payers also contributes to whether patients have access to certain products. For example, a product may be successfully listed on a national formulary, but may also be subject to further evaluations or competitive bidding by payers at a regional or hospital level. Finally, payers in some countries are beginning to experiment with alternative pricing mechanisms (e.g., payment caps) that facilitate greater predictability of payer budgets and require manufacturers to assume some financial risk. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing Biotechnology products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities for Aranesp  , Epoetin alfa, Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Vectibix  , Nplate  and other products and product candidates, including denosumab, for both commercial and clinical purposes. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and cell culture, which are the processes by which our proteins are produced. The proteins are purified to a high quality and then formulated into a stable form. The fill process dispenses the formulated bulk protein into vials or syringes. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution.  We operate commercial and clinical manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands (see  Item 2. Properties ). Manufacturing of Sensipar  , our small molecule product, is performed entirely by third-party contract manufacturers. We also use and expect to continue to use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of certain of our large molecule marketed products, including ENBREL and Nplate  , and a number of our clinical product candidates, including denosumab. The global supply of our principal products is dependent on actively managing the inventory produced at our facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers and the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. During the manufacturing scale-up process, and even after achieving sustainable commercial manufacturing, we may encounter difficulties or disruptions due to defects in raw materials or equipment, contamination or other factors which may impact product availability. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. ) We have obtained from various parties licenses that we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture of our products. These licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the licensors based on product sales. Commercial Bulk Manufacturing We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in several locations throughout the United States (see  Item 2. Properties ). Other than for ENBREL, we perform all of the commercial bulk manufacturing for our proteins. We supplement our own bulk manufacturing of ENBREL with a third-party contract manufacturer. In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of bulk Epoetin alfa, we also supply bulk Epoetin alfa in the United States to JJ under a supply agreement (see  Business Relationships  Johnson  Johnson ). Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish Manufacturing Our primary commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility is located in Puerto Rico. In addition, we operate a commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility in California for Vectibix  and conduct certain finish activities in the Netherlands (see  Item 2. Properties ). Other than for Nplate  , we perform substantially all of our commercial formulation, fill and finish activities for our proteins in Puerto Rico. The formulation, fill and finish for Nplate  is performed by a third-party contract manufacturer. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico, fill and finish of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by third-party contract manufacturers (see  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We manufacture and formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products ). Clinical Manufacturing Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see  Item 2. Properties ). Certain finishing activities for our clinical products are performed in the Netherlands. In addition, we also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain of our clinical products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United States, principally in Kentucky and California, and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. In addition, we also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our commercial and clinical products in certain areas of the world.  Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands perform key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, distribution and production scheduling. Certain of these manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA and other international regulatory agencies (see  Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards ). In preparation for the anticipated launch of Prolia  , we have performed bulk manufacturing at our Boulder, Colorado manufacturing facility and formulation, fill and finish manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico. We also have an agreement with a third-party contract manufacturer that allows us to supplement, if necessary, our own bulk manufacturing activities of denosumab. In addition, in order to assist in meeting anticipated future demand, we are expanding our Puerto Rico bulk protein facilities to manufacture denosumab, as discussed below. Manufacturing Initiatives We have certain key ongoing initiatives to assist in meeting our future manufacturing needs. To maintain supply, mitigate risks associated with the majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations being performed in a single facility, and to satisfy anticipated future demand for a number of our late-stage product candidates, in particular denosumab, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site and the expansion and qualification of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. In addition to these projects, we have initiatives designed to operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. ) Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials necessary for the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from the specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such sole-sourced suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluating alternate sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these items. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also includes bovine serum and human serum albumin (HSA). We continue to investigate alternatives to biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of biologically-sourced raw materials as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries, used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. (See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on single-source third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. ) We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes performed by us and our third-party contract manufacturers.  Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships including, joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. In addition, we also acquire product rights and have established RD collaborations with third-parties to enhance our RD capabilities and internally developed product pipeline. These arrangements may provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require parties to business relationships to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information. Kirin Holdings Company, Limited We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirins product rights, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East, (ii) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States and (iv) romiplostim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain Central Asian, African and Middle East countries. We currently market darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF and romiplostim in Japan, the Peoples Republic of China (China), Taiwan, Korea and certain other countries in Asia, (ii) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan and China. Kirin markets darbepoetin alfa in Japan under the brand name NESP  . Kirin markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under separate agreements with KA. Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN  /Grasin  /Filgrastim  . Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO  . Kirin also markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under a separate agreement with Amgen Greater China Ltd., a subsidiary of Amgen Inc. KA has licensed to JJ rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan (see  Johnson  Johnson ). Under its agreement with KA, JJ pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world. In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payment from KA for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf (see Note 8,  Related party transactions  to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Johnson  Johnson We granted JJ a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all indications other than dialysis and diagnostics. All recombinant human erythropoietin sold by JJ in the United States is manufactured by us and sold by JJ under the trademark PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT  brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN  brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. market for the dialysis indication. Pursuant to the license agreement with JJ, we earn a 10% royalty on net sales of PROCRIT  by JJ in the United States.  Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, JJ was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, JJ manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold by a subsidiary of JJ under various trademarks such as EPREX  and ERYPO  . We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by JJ outside of the United States. Pfizer Inc. Amgen and Pfizer are in a collaboration agreement to co-promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. Under the agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Amgen and Pfizer is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL, including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which requires a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the co-promotion agreement, Pfizer and Amgen each pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the joint management committee. In addition, we pay Pfizer a percentage of the annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. GlaxoSmithKline plc In July 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with GSK for the commercialization of our late-stage product candidate, denosumab, in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (the Primary Territories) for osteoporosis indications. We will commercialize denosumab for all indications in the United States and Canada and for oncology indications in the Primary Territories. GSK will commercialize denosumab for all indications in countries where we do not currently have a commercial presence, including China, Brazil, India, Taiwan and South Korea (the Expansion Territories). In the Expansion Territories, GSK will be responsible for all development and commercialization costs and will purchase denosumab from us to meet demand. We have the option of expanding our role in the commercialization of denosumab in the Primary Territories and certain of the Expansion Territories in the future. In the Primary Territories, we will share equally in commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses, including an amount payable to us in recognition of our discovery and development of denosumab that will decline as certain sales thresholds are met. GSK will also be responsible for bearing a portion of the cost of certain specified development activities. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited In February 2008, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), which provides them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 12 clinical stage molecules, including Vectibix  , from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. We have the right to participate in the promotion of these products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidate motesanib in the oncology area. Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib in the other partys territory. Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited In July 2007, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, which provides them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our late-stage product candidate, denosumab, in Japan in PMO, oncology and certain other indications. As part of the agreement, Amgen received exclusive worldwide rights to certain Daiichi Sankyo intellectual property to the extent applicable to denosumab.  Fresenius Medical Care North America In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care North America (Fresenius North America) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care), on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby they have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius North Americas commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement. Government Regulation Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production of, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products on a product-by-product basis. The failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development. We must conduct extensive clinical trials designed to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates in order to file for regulatory approval to market a product. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval we obtain remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA to begin human testing. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions. In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing is substantial and may vary by product. For example, the clinical trials for the BLA for Prolia TM were large and required substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. Foreign studies performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to good clinical practice. Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. (See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may not be able to develop commercial products.  ) The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. (See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. ) Applications . The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products subject to the Public Health Service Act or a new drug application (NDA) for drugs subject  to the approval provisions of the FDCA. The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDAs review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Post-approval Phase. After we have obtained approval to market our products, we monitor adverse events from the use of our products and report these events to regulatory agencies, along with information from post marketing surveillance or studies. We may utilize other research approaches to learn or confirm information about our marketed products, including observational studies and patient registries, and may engage in risk management activities such as physician education initiatives and patient advocacy group initiatives. We may also conduct, or be required by regulatory agencies to conduct, further clinical trials to provide additional information on our marketed products safety and efficacy. These additional trials may include, among other things, studying different doses or schedules of administration that were used in previous studies, use in other patient populations or other stages of the disease or use over a longer period of time. Additional trials of this nature are sometimes required by regulatory agencies as a condition of their approval to market our products and they may also request or require that we conduct specific studies, including observational epidemiological studies, in order to identify or assess possible safety risks of our marketed products that are observed or suggested by available scientific data and such trials are sometimes referred to as PMCs or PMRs. In the United States, under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA), if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, they may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk. If required to conduct a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require companies to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. In determining whether a product will require a REMS, the FDA may consider a number of factors including: ##TABLE_START    estimated size of the population likely to use the product ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    seriousness of the condition treated and expected benefits of the product ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    duration of treatment with the product ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    seriousness of known or potential adverse events associated with the product ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    whether the product is a new molecular entity. ##TABLE_END All REMS are required to have a timetable for assessment and may have one or more of the following three elements: ##TABLE_START    distribution of a medication guide or a patient package insert to patients ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    communication plan for the healthcare provider, such as a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    elements to ensure safe use including, but not limited to ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    specific training, experience or certification for prescribers ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    certification of medication dispensing sites and dispensing in limited settings ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    monitoring of specific patients ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    enrollment of patients in a registry. ##TABLE_END  Each REMS is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, ENBREL and Nplate  . Additionally, in response to the FDAs request, under authority prescribed by the FDAAA, we are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding an update to the existing REMS for ENBREL and a REMS for our product candidate Prolia TM . Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Also under the FDAs PLR implemented in 2006, we are required to make changes to the existing format of U.S. product package inserts for human prescription drug and biological products with the intent of making product information more easily accessible. The PLR requires revised standards of content and format of labeling and provides timelines for when new and previously approved products must comply with the new regulations. During the PLR conversion process from an old format to the new PLR format, the FDA has the authority to evaluate the package insert information to ensure that it accurately reflects current knowledge and may revise, add or remove information in the old format that could substantively impact the content of the product package insert for the new format. Failure to implement FDA-mandated changes may result in civil or criminal penalties. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. and   Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval. ) The FDA also uses various advisory committees of external experts to assist in its mission to protect and promote the public health, to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. The committees are generally advisory only and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by their recommendations. We have participated in meetings of the ODAC, the CRDAC and the ACRHD, among others, to address certain issues related to Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Prolia TM , respectively. The FDA has also announced that it will call an advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with CKD and the advisory committee could consider lowering targeted Hb levels and reducing approved dosing for ESAs. FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of products. We are required to gain FDA approval before marketing or promoting a product as a treatment for a particular indication. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (off-label promotion) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.  Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the United States. In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. The specific requirements of each track differ depending upon the type of drug being reviewed. In the centralized procedure, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the EMA who conducts a thorough evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the European Commission generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. Although not all medicines have to undergo the centralized procedure, it is required of products derived from biotechnology. After evaluation and marketing authorization, various parties, including the national competent authorities, the EMA, the European Commission and the marketing authorization holders share responsibilities for the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems in a process known as pharmacovigilance. Healthcare professionals and patients are also encouraged to report adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. This process includes the collection of adverse drug reaction reports as part of the follow-up on any side effects of a product, and upon assessment, the authorities can decide to demand that the product labels be updated with safety data or warnings, that safety data or warnings be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market. Other . We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government and the states have published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors wherever possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government was to allege against or convict us of violating these laws or we entered into a settlement with the government, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program established in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments of that law. Related to our participation in this program is a requirement that we extend comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) drug pricing program. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each of our products is currently set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any non-exempt customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program requires that we extend discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is determined for each quarter based on our reports to CMS of the quarters AMP and best price for each of our products. The terms of our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past  quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. There are also proposals related to both the Medicaid drug rebate program and the PHS drug pricing program as part of healthcare reform which could significantly alter the programs. We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHC Act), federal law has required that we offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of our products under the Medicaid program or purchase of our products by these four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to these four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. The accuracy of our reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs and our FSS contract prices may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws and the terms of our FSS contract. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies in calculation of Non-FAMPs and FCPs is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified Federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. Also, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false Non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. Finally, we are required to disclose in our FSS contract proposal all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than our proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, we are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates Our vision is to deliver therapeutics that can make a meaningful difference in patients lives. Therefore, we focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone, nephrology and general medicine, which includes cardiology and neurology. We take a modality-independent approach to RD  that is, we identify targets, and then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. As such, our discovery research programs may yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) or small molecules. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to maintain an effective development organization and associated RD support organizations. We conduct clinical trial activities with both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. In order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for  our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. ( See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. ) We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers in Canada and Germany, and smaller development facilities throughout Europe and in Canada, Australia, Mexico, Hong Kong and India (see  Item 2. Properties ). In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties, which enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These licenses and collaboration agreements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. (See  Business Relationships  and Note 3,  Acquisitions  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position. Various public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of RD in the biotechnology industry. We face competition in pursuing collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms. See  Government Regulation  Clinical Development  for a discussion of the government regulation over clinical development.  The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 5, 2010. Each target indication for product candidates in phase 3 is listed separately. For products in phase 1 and 2, the most advanced indication is shown.

AMG 102 AMG 102 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. Phase 2 studies of single agent AMG 102 for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were completed in 2009. Limited efficacy was seen in GBM and RCC when AMG 102 was administered in monotherapy, and the effect size was not large enough to warrant moving forward with late-stage studies in these monotherapy indications. Phase 2 combination studies with AMG 102 in the gastric, prostate, mCRC and small cell lung cancer settings continue. We expect data from the phase 2 study in mCRC to be available in 2010. AMG 108 AMG 108 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets inhibition of the action of interleukin-1 (IL-1). AMG 222 AMG 222 is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of DPP-IV. It is being investigated as a treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMG 222 is being developed in partnership with Servier. In July 2009, we received results from a phase 2a study of AMG 222 in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results support continued phase 2 development of AMG 222. AMG 223 AMG 223 is an orally-administered polymer which binds phosphate. It is being investigated as a treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. AMG 386 AMG 386 is a peptibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin 1 and 2. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2007 and 2008, we initiated five randomized phase 2 studies of AMG 386 for the treatment of RCC, metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, and numerous other supportive studies. Based on study results, we plan to initiate a phase 3 trial in ovarian cancer. We expect the results from these other randomized phase 2 studies to be available in 2010 and 2011. AMG 479 AMG 479 is a fully human monoclonal antibody antagonist of IGF-1 receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2007, we initiated a phase 2 study of AMG 479 as a potential cancer therapeutic in Ewings sarcoma. We also initiated, in 2008, phase 2 studies for the treatment of advanced breast, pancreatic, colorectal and small cell lung cancers. We received the results from the phase 2 pancreatic cancer study in the second half of 2009 and we plan to present the results at an upcoming medical meeting. We expect the results from the phase 2 Ewings sarcoma, metastatic breast cancer and mCRC studies to be available in 2010. AMG 785 AMG 785 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets sclerostin, a protein secreted by bone cells that inhibits bone formation. AMG 785 (also known as CDP7851) is being developed in collaboration with UCB for bone-related conditions, including PMO and fracture healing.  In 2009, we initiated phase 2 studies of AMG 785 for the treatment of PMO and fracture healing. AMG 827 AMG 827 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks signaling via the interleukin-17 (IL-17) receptor. It is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of inflammatory disorders. In 2009, we initiated phase 2 studies of AMG 827 as a potential treatment for psoriasis and RA. We expect data from the phase 2 study in psoriasis to be available in 2010. AMG 853 AMG 853 is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of the CRTH2 and D-prostanoid receptors of prostaglandin D2. It is being investigated as a treatment for asthma. Phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose studies have been completed. A global, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose phase 2 study in subjects with inadequately controlled asthma was initiated in December 2009. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  is a recombinant human protein agonist of the erythropoietic receptor. In 2009, we announced the results from TREAT, the large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of patients with CKD (not requiring dialysis), anemia and type-2 diabetes. Treatment of anemia with Aranesp  to a Hb target of 13 g/dL failed to meet either of two primary endpoints compared with placebo treatment with Aranesp  when the Hb level was less than 9 g/dL. The two primary endpoints were a composite of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (including heart failure, heart attack, stroke or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia) and a composite of time to all-cause mortality or chronic renal replacement therapy. Among the components of the TREAT outcomes measures, stroke was more likely to occur in the patients who received Aranesp  (101 patients [5.0%] versus 53 patients [2.6%]; Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.92 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.38 to 2.68; P0.001]). Although stroke has been noted in the Aranesp  label since 2001, the risk of stroke observed in TREAT was of a higher magnitude than that seen in previous clinical trials in CKD patients not on dialysis. Further, among patients who reported a history of cancer, there were 60 deaths from any cause in the 188 patients assigned to Aranesp  and 37 deaths in the 160 patients assigned to placebo (P=0.13 by the log-rank test). In this subgroup, 14 of the 188 patients assigned to Aranesp  died from cancer, as compared with 1 of the 160 patients assigned to placebo (P=0.002 by the log-rank test). Aranesp  treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in blood transfusions. The Reduction of Events with Darbepoetin alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF  ) Trial phase 3 study, initiated in 2006, is a large (2,600 subjects), global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure. The RED-HF  Trial continues to enroll subjects. On December 8, 2009, the RED-HF  Trial Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed approximately 43% of the target number of primary endpoints. After careful review of outcomes and adverse events, including the results of TREAT (which was conducted in subjects with CKD, anemia and type 2 diabetes who were not receiving dialysis), the RED-HF  Trial DMC recommended that the study continue as designed. Conatumumab (AMG 655) Conatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody agonist that targets death receptor 5 (DR5) and induces apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We received the results from the phase 2 NSCLC and the soft tissue sarcoma studies in the second half of 2009 and we continue to analyze the data. We also received results from the phase 2 pancreatic cancer study and we plan to present the results at an upcoming medical meeting. We expect data from an on-going phase 2 study in mCRC to be available in 2010.  Dulanermin (rhApo2L/TRAIL) Dulanermin is a recombinant human protein that targets death receptors 4 (DR4) and DR5 and induces apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this molecule in collaboration with Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned member of the Roche Group. Phase 2 data from the non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and NSCLC studies have been analyzed and we plan to present the results at an upcoming medical meeting. Denosumab Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function and survival. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone metastases, multiple myeloma and RA. The overall denosumab program remains on track with all completed phase 3 trials for denosumab having met all primary endpoints. The following chart is an overview of the phase 3 clinical development program for denosumab: ##TABLE_START Program Area  Indication  Enrollment Status  Projected Data Availability Osteoporosis  PMO Treatment (versus placebo)  Complete  Received Osteoporosis  PMO Treatment (versus ALN)  Complete  Received Osteoporosis  PMO Prevention  Complete  Received Osteoporosis  PMO Transition (from ALN)  Complete  Received Osteoporosis  Male Osteoporosis  Enrolling  2012 Oncology  Treatment-Induced Bone Loss-Prostate Cancer  Complete  Received Oncology  Treatment-Induced Bone Loss-Breast Cancer  Complete  Received Oncology  Bone Metastases-Prostate Cancer  Complete  2010 (1) Oncology  Bone Metastases-Breast Cancer  Approved  TBD (2) Oncology  Skeletal-Related Events-Breast Cancer  Complete  Received Oncology  Skeletal-Related Events-Solid Tumors/multiple myeloma  Complete  Received Oncology  Skeletal-Related Events-Prostate Cancer  Complete  Received ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Event-driven study and consequently data availability may vary as a result ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2 ) TBD = to be determined ##TABLE_END In 2009, we announced that a pivotal, phase 3, head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  in the treatment of bone metastases in 2,046 patients with advanced breast cancer met its primary endpoint (non-inferiority compared to Zometa  ) and secondary endpoints (superiority compared to Zometa  ). Superior efficacy compared to Zometa  was demonstrated for both delaying the time to the first on-study SREs (fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression) (HR: 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 - 0.95]), and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs (HR: 0.77 [95% CI 0.66 - 0.89]). Both results were statistically significant in this 34 month study. The median time to first on-study SRE was not reached for denosumab and therefore could not be estimated. The median time to first on-study SRE was 26.5 months for Zometa  , the current standard of care. Overall, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was consistent with what has previously been reported for these two agents. Of note, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which had not been observed in previously reported phase 3 studies with denosumab, was seen infrequently in both treatment groups (20 patients receiving denosumab as compared with 14 patients receiving Zometa  ). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of ONJ between the two treatment arms. Infectious adverse events were balanced between the two treatment arms, as was OS and the time to cancer progression. In 2009, we also announced that a pivotal, phase 3, head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab administered subcutaneously versus Zometa  administered as an intravenous infusion in the treatment of bone metastases in 1,776 advanced cancer patients with solid tumors (not including breast and prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma  met its primary endpoint. For the primary endpoint of this study, the median time to first on-study SRE (fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression) was 20.6 months for those patients receiving denosumab and 16.3 months for those patients receiving Zometa  (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.98), which is statistically significant for non-inferiority (p=0.0007). Although numerically greater, the delay in the time to first SRE associated with denosumab was not statistically superior compared to Zometa  based upon the statistical testing strategy (adjusted p=0.06) (secondary endpoint). The time to first-and-subsequent SRE was also numerically greater but not statistically superior compared to Zometa  (HR: 0.90 [95% CI 0.77 - 1.04]) (secondary endpoint). Overall, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was consistent with what has previously been reported for these two agents. Rates of ONJ were balanced and infrequent in both treatment groups (10 patients receiving denosumab as compared with 11 patients receiving Zometa  ). Infectious adverse events were balanced between the two treatment arms, as was OS and the time to cancer progression. On February 8, 2010, we announced that a pivotal, phase 3, head-to-head trial evaluating denosumab versus Zometa  in the treatment of bone metastases in 1,901 men with advanced prostate cancer met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in time to first SRE and its secondary endpoints (superiority compared to Zometa  for both delaying the time to the first on-study SRE and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs). Denosumab demonstrated superiority over Zometa  for both delaying the time to the first on-study SREs (fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression) (HR: 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 - 0.95]), and delaying the time to the first-and-subsequent SREs (HR: 0.82 [95% CI 0.71 - 0.94]). Both results were statistically significant. Overall rates of adverse events and serious adverse events, including infections, were generally similar between the two arms. ONJ was infrequent (22 patients receiving denosumab as compared with 12 patients receiving Zometa  ) and there was no statistically significant difference between treatment arms. As with previous studies in advanced cancer patients, hypocalcemia was more frequent in the denosumab arm. Both OS and the time to cancer progression were balanced between treatment arms. The phase 3 147 study evaluating denosumab in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer to prevent bone metastases is ongoing. We expect to receive the results from this study the second half of 2010. Motesanib Motesanib is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and stem cell factor receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this product in collaboration with Takeda. Enrollment in the phase 3 first-line NSCLC study (MONET1) evaluating motesanib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC is nearly complete. Based on current event rates, we anticipate completion of the study in 2011. In April 2009, Amgen and Millennium announced the phase 2 trial in metastatic breast cancer has been completed and the results support continued development. Nplate  (romiplostim) Nplate  is a peptibody agonist of the TPO receptor. Nplate  is the first FDA-approved agent that acts directly to increase platelet production for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in splenectomized (spleen removed) and non-splenectomized adults with chronic ITP, who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy. In December 2009, we announced results from its first phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Nplate  in children with chronic ITP. Results of the study showed that treatment with Nplate  appeared to be generally well-tolerated compared to placebo in children (aged 12 months to less than 18 years old) with chronic ITP (treatment related adverse events = 18% versus 20%, respectively). In addition, we announced results from three studies on the safety and efficacy of Nplate  in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Data from two separate phase 2 studies showed that patients with low  and intermediate risk MDS currently receiving either decitabine or lenalidomide showed reduced incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events and platelet transfusions with the addition of Nplate  treatment. We are also evaluating Nplate  in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Omecamtiv mecarbil (AMG 423) Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small molecule activator of cardiac myosin. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being investigated to improve cardiac contractility in subjects with heart failure. We are developing this product in collaboration with Cytokinetics, Inc. (Cytokinetics). In May 2009, Cytokinetics and Amgen Inc. announced that Amgen had exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license, worldwide (excluding Japan), to Cytokinetics cardiac contractility program, which includes omecamtiv mecarbil. Sensipar  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  /Mimpara  is an orally-administered small molecule that lowers PTH levels in blood by signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid tissue to inhibit PTH secretion. It also lowers blood calcium and phosphorous levels. The phase 3 EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (E.V.O.L.V.E.  ) trial, initiated in 2006, is a large (3,800 patient), multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects of Sensipar  on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. The E.V.O.L.V.E.  study completed enrollment in January 2008. Based on current event rates, we anticipate completion of the study in dialysis patients in 2011. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is a fully human monoclonal antibody antagonist of the EGFr pathway. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In September 2009, we announced detailed results from the phase 3 181 trial evaluating Vectibix  in combination with FOLFIRI (an irinotecan-based chemotherapy), as a second-line treatment for mCRC. The 181 trial is a global, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study. Patients enrolled in the study were randomized to receive either 6.0 milligram/kilogram of Vectibix  and FOLFIRI once every two weeks or FOLFIRI alone once every two weeks. The independently tested co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, time to progression, duration of response and safety by KRAS status. Originally designed to compare the treatment effect in the overall population, the study was amended to analyze outcomes with respect to the presence or absence of activating mutations in KRAS . Tumor KRAS status was ascertained in 91% of the 1,186 patients enrolled in this trial, the highest number ever reported for a second-line trial. In this trial, Vectibix  significantly improved PFS in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. The addition of Vectibix  to FOLFIRI significantly improved median PFS (co-primary endpoint) by two months (5.9 months versus 3.9 months for patients treated with FOLFIRI alone, HR: 0.73, p=0.004) in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. Although numerically greater (14.5 months versus 12.5 months, HR: 0.85), the improvement in median OS (co-primary endpoint) in the Vectibix  arm did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.115) in the same patient population. Further, the addition of Vectibix  to FOLFIRI resulted in greater than a three-fold improvement (35% versus 10%) in response rate in the KRAS wild-type patient population as measured by a blinded central review. In general, adverse events rates were comparable across arms with the exception of known toxicities associated with anti-EGFr therapy such as rash, diarrhea and hypomagnesemia. Vectibix  -related grade 3/4 infusion reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients. There were no differences in PFS, OS and response rates among patients with mutated KRAS who received Vectibix  . Tumor KRAS tests were finalized after the completion of enrollment and prior to the primary analysis. Also in September 2009, we announced detailed results from the phase 3 203 trial evaluating Vectibix  administered in combination with FOLFOX (an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy) as the first-line treatment of  mCRC. In this trial, Vectibix  significantly improved median PFS by 1.6 months (9.6 months versus 8.0 months for patients treated with FOLFOX alone, (HR: 0.80; p=0.02)) in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC (primary endpoint). Further, the addition of Vectibix  to chemotherapy also increased the response rate in the KRAS wild-type patient population as measured by blinded central review (55% versus 48% in the FOLFOX only arm). Importantly, in patients with tumors harboring activating KRAS mutations, PFS was significantly inferior in the Vectibix  arm. For patients with mutant KRAS tumors, median PFS was 7.3 months with Vectibix  in combination with FOLFOX versus 8.8 months with FOLFOX alone (HR: 1.29, p=0.02). These data confirm previous findings when oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and an anti-EGFr antibody are combined in patients bearing tumors with activating KRAS mutations. Adverse event rates were comparable across arms with the exception of known toxicities associated with anti-EGFr therapy such as rash, diarrhea and hypomagnesemia. Vectibix  -related grade 3 infusion reactions were reported for two patients (less than 1%). Originally designed to compare the treatment effect in the overall population, the study was amended to analyze outcomes with respect to the presence or absence of activating mutations in KRAS in the tumor itself. Tumor KRAS status was ascertained in 93% of the 1,183 patients enrolled in the trial, the highest percentage ever reported. Tumor KRAS tests were finalized after the completion of enrollment and prior to the primary analysis. In November 2009, we announced that the phase 3 203 trial evaluating Vectibix  administered in combination with FOLFOX (an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy) as a first-line treatment of mCRC failed to meet a secondary endpoint of OS. The prospective analysis of the 203 study showed that Vectibix  , when added to a FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, resulted in a median OS of 23.9 months compared to 19.7 months for patients treated with FOLFOX alone. The median OS difference of 4.2 months in the Vectibix  arm did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.83, p=0.072). OS appeared to be reduced in patients with KRAS mutant tumors receiving Vectibix  . Although not statistically significant, this result emphasizes the importance, as described in product labeling, of ensuring that patients receiving Vectibix  do not bear tumors containing KRAS mutations. In 2007, we initiated a phase 3 study for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as well as two randomized phase 2 studies in locally advanced SCCHN testing Vectibix  in combination with chemoradiotherapy or with radiotherapy alone. We expect the results from this study to be available in 2010. Vectibix  is also being investigated in combination with other investigational anti-cancer therapies. Human Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 17,200 staff members, which include approximately 200 part-time staff members. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants and scientific advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or the consulting relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Also, regulatory agencies could add new regulations or change existing regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. Regulatory reform efforts currently under discussion by U.S. policymakers may include changes to applicable laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on our business. For example, the 2007 creation of the FDAAA significantly added to the FDAs authority, allowing the FDA to (i) require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical stud -  ies; (ii) mandate labeling changes to products and (iii) require sponsors to implement a REMS for a product. Failure to comply with FDAAA requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased product liability risk. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to regulatory policy affecting our business could occur, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. For example, in October 2009 we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA for the BLA for our late-stage product candidate Prolia TM in the treatment and prevention of PMO and in the treatment and prevention of bone loss due to HALT in breast and prostate cancer patients. The Complete Response Letter related to the PMO indication requested several items, including further information on the design and background adverse event rates that will inform the methodology of our previously submitted post-marketing surveillance program. The FDA also requested a new clinical program to support approval of Prolia TM for the prevention of PMO, updated safety data and stated that a REMS is necessary for Prolia TM . The Complete Response Letter related to the HALT indication requested additional information regarding the safety of Prolia TM in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy and patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT. The FDA specifically requested results from additional adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating that Prolia TM has no detrimental effects on either time to disease progression or OS. On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia TM in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. A significant delay in regulatory approval to market and sell Prolia TM for the treatment of PMO could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. In addition, some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling requirements of regulators. Vectibix  , for example, received conditional approval in the United States and EU, with final approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix  as a therapy in treating mCRC. Our conditional approval of Vectibix  in the EU was received in December 2007 and is reviewed annually by the CHMP and in December 2008 and 2009 we received renewal of the conditional approval subject to us completing an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication. In 2009, the CHMP approved our protocol for this additional clinical trial, which will compare the effect of Vectibix  versus Erbitux  on OS for chemorefractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors. Further, some of our products or product candidates may be used with a companion diagnostic product, such as a test-kit, or companion device, such as an injector or other delivery system. These product candidates or expanded indications of our products may not be approved if the companion diagnostic product or companion device does not gain or maintain regulatory approval. These companion diagnostics and devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of these third-party companies in conducting the studies required for such approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. Delays in the studies or failure of the third-party company to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or device could negatively impact the approval of our product candidate or the expanded indication of our product and we may incur increased development costs, delays in regulatory approval, associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. The occurrence of a number of high profile safety events has caused an increased public and governmental concern about potential safety issues relating to pharmaceutical and biological products and certain of our products and product candidates. (See  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. ) As a result of this increased concern, safety signals and safety concerns resulting from clinical trials (including sub-analyses and meta-analyses), market use or other sources are receiving greater scrutiny. Actual or perceived safety problems could lead to significant revised or restrictive labeling of our approved products or a class of products, potentially including limitations on the use of approved products in certain patients because of: ##TABLE_START    the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns with respect to any of our products by regulatory agencies ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    an increased rate or number of previously-identified safety-related events ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related to results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, or meta-analysis (a meta-analysis is the review of studies using various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) of clinical trials or clinical data performed by us or others ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new legislation or rules by regulatory agencies ##TABLE_END For example, on December 16, 2009, based on the TREAT results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. (See   Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. ) In addition to revised labeling for our products, discovery of new safety information or previously unknown safety concerns and/or safety signals with our products could also lead to: ##TABLE_START    requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) related to the promotion and sale of our products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    mandated PMCs or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product recalls of certain of our approved products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas, and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delay in or fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies ##TABLE_END Product safety concerns could cause regulatory agencies to impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS), which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop and implement. The results of these risk management activities could: ##TABLE_START    impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limit patient access to our products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    place administrative burdens on healthcare providers in prescribing our products, or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS or similar risk management activities ##TABLE_END We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, ENBREL and Nplate  and are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding an update to the existing REMS for ENBREL and a REMS for our product candidate Prolia TM . Further, if new medical data or product quality issues suggest an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may withdraw some or all affected product  either voluntarily or by regulatory mandate  in certain therapeutic areas, or completely recall a product presentation from the market for some period or permanently. For example, in September 2009, we initiated a voluntary recall of a limited number of ENBREL SureClick  lots due to a defect in the glass syringe barrel which resulted in a small number of broken syringes following assembly of the autoinjector device. We may experience the same or other problems in the future resulting in broader product recalls or adverse event trends, which may adversely affect the sales of our products. Additionally, if other parties (including our licensees, such as JJ and Pfizer, or independent investigators) report or fail to effectively report to regulatory agencies side effects or other safety concerns that occur from their use of our products in clinical trials or studies or from marketed use, resulting regulatory action could adversely affect the sales of our products and our business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the RD of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may not  approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Further, safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) from the marketed use of our drugs that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. Beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESA products were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny from regulatory authorities. In the United States, the FDA continues to review the benefit-risk profile of ESAs, which have resulted and could result in future changes to ESA labeling and usage. For example, we revised the labeling for our ESAs in August 2008, as the FDA directed, and since that time have experienced a reduction in our ESA sales, in particular Aranesp  sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. In October 2009, the results from TREAT, a phase 3 pivotal study of patients with CKD not on dialysis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine . The study failed to meet its primary objectives of demonstrating a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, including heart failure, heart attack, stroke or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, or time to ESRD. On December 16, 2009, based on the TREAT results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. In an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2010, the FDA announced that it will call an advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with CKD and could consider lowering targeted Hb levels. In addition, CMS has scheduled a MEDCAC meeting for March 24, 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which may consider the results from the TREAT study. The FDA may also require that we update the REMS for ESAs based on the TREAT results. Although we cannot predict what impact all of these activities could have on our business, the revised ESA labeling or any future labeling changes, including any required in connection with the scheduled advisory committee meeting, our ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the conversion of the format of our ESA U.S. labels in accordance with the PLR or other changes required by the FDA, the outcome from the MEDCAC meeting or the impact of the approved REMS for ESAs could have a material adverse impact on the coverage, reimbursement and sales of our ESAs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approva l . and Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. ) We also have ongoing PMC studies for our ESAs which must be conducted to maintain regulatory approval and marketing authorization. We have agreed with the FDA to a robust pharmacovigilance program to continue to study the safety surrounding the use of ESAs in the oncology setting and we initiated Study 782 as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program, a phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating OS when comparing NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo. We are currently identifying clinical sites for Study 782 and have begun enrolling patients in the study. Further, in 2008 the FDA and EMA reviewed interim results from the Preoperative Epirubicin Paclitaxel Aranesp  (PREPARE) study in neo-adjuvant breast cancer, a PMC study, which were ultimately incorporated into the ESA labeling in both the United States and the EU. We received the final results from the PREPARE study in 2009, which were substantially consistent with the interim results, and provided that data to the FDA and EMA. Although we cannot predict the results or the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, or the extent to which regulatory authorities may require additional labeling changes as a result of these or other trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that adverse results from clinical trials, including PMCs, could have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also reviewed and scrutinized the use of our ESA products. In June 2008, the EMA recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients, which was approved by the European Commission in October 2008. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient. Since the October 2008 revision, we have experienced a reduction of Aranesp  sales in the supportive cancer care setting in the EU and, although we cannot predict what further impact the revised EU ESA product information could have on our business, the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp  in Europe could further be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, we continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs, including PMCs, and adverse results could negatively impact the use and sales of our ESAs. For example, in September 2008, we announced that we had received a summary of preliminary results from the Cochrane Collaborations independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and the EMA. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient-level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion but they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of these clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA . (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval. ) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. For example, in 2006 we delayed the start of our phase 3 trial in first-line NSCLC due to an increased frequency of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) in patients treated with our late-stage product candidate motesanib. Following initiation of the trial in November 2008, enrollment in this phase 3 trial was temporarily suspended following a planned safety data review of 600 patients by the studys independent DMC. In February 2009, the DMC recommended the trial resume enrollment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC only, and in June 2009, we reinitiated enrollment in this patient population following an FDA-approved revision to the study protocol. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, East Asia and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatory diverse clinical trials, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.)  Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators clinical trials which could: ##TABLE_START    delay the clinical trial program ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require additional or longer trials to gain approval ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, we are moving forward with Study 782 as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. (See  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. ) Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of all of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. We rely in large part on the reimbursement of our principal products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in foreign countries. (See  Item 1. Business  Reimbursement ) The government-sponsored healthcare systems in Europe and other foreign countries are the primary payers of healthcare costs in those regions. Governments and private payers may regulate prices, reimbursement levels and/or access to our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. We cannot predict the availability or level of coverage and reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates and a reduction in coverage and/or reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. Healthcare reform, focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and reducing the rate of increase in the cost of healthcare, remains a priority for President Obama, U.S. Congress and a number of states. Developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict. As recently as February 23, 2010, President Obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the Senate and House of Representatives bills passed in late 2009. Certain healthcare reform proposals being considered, which may or may not be adopted into law, could: ##TABLE_START    restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition and/or ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    require additional healthcare reform costs to be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. ##TABLE_END We cannot predict whether these or any future proposed reform measures will be adopted into law. Healthcare cost-containment measures or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and any changes to the current U.S. healthcare system that reduce the coverage and reimbursement of our products, or restrict the way our products are used or prescribed, could have a material adverse impact on our business. (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval. ) Public and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. For example, most of our products furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in both a physician office setting and hospital outpatient setting are reimbursed under the ASP payment methodology. The ASP payment rate for most of our products furnished in the hospital outpatient setting has been reduced twice since 2007. ASP-based reimbursements of products under Medicare may be below or could fall below the cost that some medical providers pay for such products, which would adversely affect sales of our products. We also face certain risks relating to the calculation of ASP. ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. However, the statute, regulations and CMS guidance do not define specific methodologies for all aspects of the calculation of ASP. For example, in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule for 2010, CMS did not address a proposed methodology for treatment of bundled price concessions. Consequently, the current CMS guidance is that manufacturers may make reasonable assumptions in their calculation of ASP consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute, federal regulations and their customary business practices. As a result, we are required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of calculating ASP which are disclosed to CMS and also are subject to further CMS review. If our calculation of ASP is incorrect, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Other initiatives reviewing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement rates. For example, in March 2007, CMS announced a review of all Medicare coverage policies related to the administration of ESAs in non-renal disease applications which is a precursor to a NCD. In July 2007, CMS issued a NCD where it determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. We believe the restrictions in the NCD on the coverage and reimbursement of ESAs has had a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , which has had a significant impact to our business. We believe that the NCD may continue to impact us in the future. In the dialysis setting, the reimbursement rates for our products may also be subject to downward pressure. In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN  by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved dialysis providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs while the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement methodology is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by CMS. Since April 2006, the Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has been subject to an EMP, the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN  and Aranesp  utilization and hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. CMS revised the EMP, effective January 2008, further limiting reimbursement for EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in certain cases. Further reduction in reimbursement in the dialysis setting could have a material adverse effect on sales of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  , and our business. In addition, on July 30, 2008, CMS issued a listing of potential topics for future NCDs as a step to increase transparency in the NCD process, which included as potential topics the use of ESAs in ESRD and CKD. Medicare currently does not have a NCD for the use of ESAs for anemia in patients who have CKD and CMS has not announced whether it will proceed with a NCD for ESAs in ESRD or CKD. However, CMS announced it had scheduled a MEDCAC meeting for March 24, 2010 to review the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which may consider the results of the TREAT study. In February 2010, CMS released the voting questions the MEDCAC will address, including whether the available evidence in both CKD not on dialysis and  ESRD clearly (i) demonstrates the benefits and risks of ESA therapy, (ii) supports a baseline Hb range or (iii) justifies a dose response or maximum dose. CMS will decide whether more evidence is needed to determine whether ESA treatment is reasonable and necessary to support continued Medicare coverage. CMS may consider initiating a NCA or a NCD following the MEDCAC and a NCD for ESAs in the renal setting, which may include non-coverage and/or new dosing and treatment restrictions, could negatively affect use, reimbursement and coverage, and product sales of our ESA products. Also included in the initial potential future NCD topic list is the category of thrombopoiesis stimulating agents (platelet growth factors), the category of drugs that includes Nplate  although CMS has not announced whether it will proceed with a NCD related to thrombopoiesis stimulating agents. Additional initiatives addressing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement, which could negatively affect sales of our products. For example, on September 15, 2009, CMS released its proposed rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for ESRD facilities as required by the MIPPA. Although we cannot predict what the final rule on the bundled payment system for ESRD facilities will include, implementation of the rule as proposed could have a material adverse impact on the coverage and reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN  and Sensipar  . Healthcare providers may narrow the circumstances in which they prescribe or administer our products if reimbursement rates are reduced or in anticipation of reimbursement being reduced, which could reduce the use and/or price of our products. A reduction in the use or price of our products could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market and we may be subject to competition during certain periods of litigation. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, products approved by the FDA under a NDA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act has expired and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In recent years, policymakers have proposed reforming U.S. patent laws and regulations. For example, patent reform legislation was introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress in 2009, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a patent reform bill on April 2, 2009. In general, the proposed legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for challenging patents. While we cannot predict what form any new patent reform laws or regulations ultimately may take, final legislation could introduce new substantive rules and procedures for challenging patents, and certain reforms that make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may not be able to develop commercial products. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant RD investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START    the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined ##TABLE_END For example, after discussions with the FDA we have decided not to file for approval of motesanib in refractory thyroid cancer until there is more clarity on what would constitute an appropriate regulatory filing package for that indication. Further, several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) for the treatment of advanced Parkinsons disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The conclusion was reached even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinsons disease patients. Subsequently, we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts, fines, penalties and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We have received subpoenas from a number of government entities, including the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington, as well as the Attorneys General of New  York and New Jersey. The federal subpoenas have been issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 3486), and by a federal grand jury, while the Attorneys General subpoenas have been issued pursuant to state specific statutes relating to consumer fraud laws and state false claims acts. In general, the subpoenas request documents relating to the sales and marketing of our products, and our collection and dissemination of information reflecting clinical research as to the safety and efficacy of our ESAs. Based on representations in a U.S. government filing that became public in May 2009 relating to the Massachusetts Qui Tam Action, we now believe the subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington also relate to nine additional Qui Tam Actions which are purportedly pending against Amgen, including eight pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and one pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The U.S. government filing further alleges that a large number of states are involved in the Qui Tam investigations, led by the State of New York. These investigations are represented to be joint criminal and civil investigations. On October 30, 2009 fourteen states and the District of Columbias state attorneys general filed an amended complaint in intervention against Amgen alleging violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and various state false claims acts. Additionally, the U.S. government may seek to intervene in the lawsuit filed by the states at any time. Although we cannot predict whether additional proceedings may be initiated against us, or predict when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time and to require managements attention and significant legal expense. A determination that we are in violation of the various federal and state laws that govern the sales and marketing of our products could result in federal criminal liability and/or federal or state civil or administrative liability, and thus could result in substantial financial damages or criminal penalties and possible exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology industry, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. Historically, we have occasionally and opportunistically accessed the capital markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions, in-licensing activities, share repurchases and to refinance existing debt. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. (See  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. ) As a result of the current global economic downturn, our third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government and/or private payer healthcare programs could have a material adverse affect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.  In addition, as a result of the economic downturn, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, the economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe that these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third-parties which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that has and may continue to contribute to lower sales of our products. For example, in the first quarter of 2009, certain of our wholesale distributors lowered their levels of inventory on hand, which we believe was done to reduce their carrying costs and improve their results of operations Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity, in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of these events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. We rely on single-source third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START    regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak or otherwise ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall ##TABLE_END These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. However, we may experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing and the formulation of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also includes bovine serum and HSA. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries, used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently manufacture all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Sensipar  /Mimpara  and Nplate  as well as our late-stage product candidate denosumab and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce a number of our other late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START    availability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with regulatory requirements ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in forecasts of future demand ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing and actual number of production runs ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    updating of manufacturing specifications ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    production success rates and bulk drug yields ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing and outcome of product quality testing ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. In order to maintain supply, mitigate risks associated with the majority of our formulation, fill and finish operations being performed in a single facility and to satisfy anticipated demand for our late-stage product candidates, in particular denosumab, we must successfully implement certain manufacturing projects on schedule. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through a single distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and another in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and the rest of the world. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers and our third-party logistics providers. We manufacture and formulate, fill and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  , and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL, and all of the bulk manufacturing for Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. In addition if denosumab is approved by the FDA, it will be primarily produced at the Puerto Rico facility. Our global supply of these products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. A number of factors could adversely affect our operations, including: ##TABLE_START    power failures and/or other utility failures ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    improper installation or operation of equipment ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA ##TABLE_END  In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and such losses could materially adversely affect our product sales and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of ENBREL voluntarily recalled in September 2009 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility and we have made commitments to the FDA to address the causes behind the recall. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDAs expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales .) Our marketed products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency. These companies may have greater resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilar products, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. Lawmakers in the United States have proposed bills to create a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval of biosimilars, and the EU has already created such a regulatory pathway. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. In the EU, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2006, the EMA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products, including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, recommending that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct pharmacodynamic, toxicological and clinical safety studies as well as a pharmacovigilance program. Some companies have received and other companies are seeking approval to market erythropoietin and G-CSF biosimilars in the EU, presenting additional competition for our products. (See   Our marketed products face substantial competition.  ) For example, following the expiration of the principal European patent relating to recombinant G-CSF in August 2006, the European Commission issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilar products and the product was launched in certain EU countries in 2008 and 2009. There are several G-CSF biosimilars available in the EU marketed by different companies and these G-CSF biosimilar  products compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products will impact future NEUPOGEN  or Neulasta  sales in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the United States, there is no regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval of BLAs for biosimilars, but legislation on biosimilars has been proposed and may be enacted in the in the near future. Such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products already approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Under current law, potential competitors may introduce biotechnology products in the United States only by filing a complete BLA. Before biosimilar products could enter the U.S. market through an abbreviated approval process, the U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation to create a new approval pathway and the FDA may also then promulgate associated regulations or guidance. The Obama Administration has expressed support for the creation of such an approval pathway for biosimilars, including as a part of its broader healthcare reform effort, which the Administration has identified as one of its top priorities. In late 2009, both the full House of Representatives and the Senate passed bills that would provide twelve years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products. Data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by, for a limited period of time, prohibiting others from gaining FDA approval based, in part, on reliance or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The debate on biosimilars continues, however, with a number of members of the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration supporting a shorter period of data exclusivity. We cannot predict what the specific provisions of any final legislation might be or the timing of implementation of the pathway by the FDA. To the extent that an abbreviated biosimilar pathway is created through legislation in the United States, we would likely face greater competition and downward pressure on our product prices, sales and revenues, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. Further, biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval if an abbreviated regulatory pathway for biosimilars is adopted. However, the absence of an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products may not be a complete barrier to the introduction of biosimilar-type products in the United States. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. These entities purchasing leverage has increased due to this concentration and consolidation which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is primarily sold to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita Inc. and Fresenius North America own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius North America, on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby they have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius North Americas commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius North America and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement. Our marketing of ENBREL is dependent in part upon Pfizer (formerly Wyeth). On October 15, 2009, Pfizer and Wyeth completed their merger and our relationship with Pfizer may be different than our prior relationship with Wyeth. Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Pfizer is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan and the establishment of a brand team. The brand  team, with equal representation from us and Pfizer, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Pfizer fails to effectively deliver on its marketing commitments to us or if we and Pfizer fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL may be materially adversely affected. We may be forced to undertake cost savings and/or restructuring initiatives in the future. As a result of various regulatory and reimbursement developments that began in 2007, we completed a restructuring of our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant RD investments and build the framework for our future growth. As part of these actions, we reduced staff, made changes to certain capital projects, closed certain production operations and abandoned leases primarily for certain RD facilities that will not be used in our operations. Our business continues to face a variety of challenges. As a result, we may be forced to undertake further cost saving and/or restructuring initiatives in the future. The current economic climate has forced many U.S. companies to cut costs in order to maintain their competitive standing, including through restructurings and reorganizations. We have worked, and we continue to work, to increase cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. The anticipated benefits of our cost reduction initiatives are based on forecasts which could vary substantially from actual results, and we cannot provide assurance that any such cost saving initiatives will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies and reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include: ##TABLE_START    On July 31, 2009, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO) released its Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). The guideline includes detailed recommendations for the diagnosis and evaluation of the three components of CKD-MBD followed by recommendations for treatment. These recommendations could affect how healthcare providers prescribe Sensipar  for ESRD patients. The impact of the KDIGO is guidelines on clinical practice or the use of Sensipar  is not yet known. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In August 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) distributed to the nephrology community final updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD. The NKF-KDOQI  Anemia Work Group recommended in their 2007 Update to the NKF-KDOQI  Anemia Management Guidelines that physicians target Hb in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL, and also stipulated that the target not be above 13 g/dL. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In February 2007, following the reported results from our Anemia of Cancer (AoC) 103 Study, the United States Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp  in the treatment of AoC. ##TABLE_END Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.  Our corporate compliance and risk mitigation programs cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or that we effectively manage all operational risks. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval.  and  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. ) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee you that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Additionally, while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. If we fail to effectively mitigate all operational risks, our product supply may be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. Continual process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred. In connection with our continuous process improvement activities, we evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business in order to reduce costs. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing practices and related processes to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization to gain increased cost efficiencies. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these process improvement initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment charges and/or the recognition of other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Stock repurchase program Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of our common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including the stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions.

The purchase price paid was approximately $168 million, which included the carrying value of our existing 49% ownership in Domp. In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa, Inc. (Ilypsa) for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (Alantos) for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (Avidia) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. In August 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. (Tularik). Included in operating expenses are acquisition-related charges of $1 million, $58 million, $41 million and $12 million, in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Acquisition charges, net of tax, for the four years ended December 31, 2008 were $1 million, $35 million, $26 million and $7 million, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of, where applicable, the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value, which is in excess of our manufacturing cost, and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquired company. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (3) Included in Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) for 2007 is a charge of $30 million related to the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Included in RD expenses for 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the RD technology intangible assets acquired with alternative future uses of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively, acquired with the acquisitions of Avidia and Abgenix in 2006. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, primarily related to ENBREL, acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the five years ended December 31, 2009 were $186 million, $183 million, $185 million, $200 million and $215 million, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6) As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007 and Avidia and Abgenix in 2006, under then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process RD (IPRD) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, and $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively. These charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPRD that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7) In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (Ortho Biotech) antitrust suit. In 2007, we recorded a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. In 2005, we settled certain legal matters, primarily related to a patent legal proceeding, and recorded an expense of $49 million, net of amounts previously accrued. The remaining amounts included in Other charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007, primarily relate to restructuring charges (see Note 9,  Restructuring  to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (8) In January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the 2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the 2039 Notes). In November 2009, we repaid our $1.0 billion 4.00% notes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (9) In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the 2038 Notes). In June and November 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (10) On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program (ASR) entered into in May 2007. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (11) In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Notes). In connection with the issuance of these notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of these notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (12) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2009, we have had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we have repurchased $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (13) Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this new standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes, including our 2011 Convertible Notes, 2013 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified Convertible Notes, are included in Common stock and additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is non-cash interest expense of $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax), $168 million ($88 million, net of tax) , $197 million ($141 million, net of tax) and $67 million ($41 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the amortization of the discounts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment  human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business. Government authorities in the United States and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the FDA, to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products, which may lead to fewer products being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, delays in receiving approvals or additional safety-related requirements or restrictions on the use of our products, including expanded safety labeling, required risk management activities, including a REMS, and/or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of PMCs, PMRs or a pharmacovigilance program. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While these therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve a relatively new or higher level of scientific complexity and, therefore, generate increased safety concerns. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which are placing greater emphasis on cost containment, including requiring that the economic value of products be clearly demonstrated. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare  providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. Therefore, sales of our principal products have and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans, and administration of those programs. Additionally, ongoing healthcare reform efforts may also have a significant impact on our business. For example healthcare reform, focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and reducing the rate of increase in the costs of healthcare, remains a priority for President Obama, U.S. Congress and a number of states. Developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict. As recently as February 23, 2010, President Obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the Senate and House of Representatives bills passed in late 2009. Certain healthcare reform proposals being considered, which may or may not be adopted into law, could: ##TABLE_START    restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require additional healthcare reform costs be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies ##TABLE_END At this time, we cannot predict which or whether any reform measures will be adopted into law. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and ENBREL all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see  Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates . Our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and customer buying patterns, both of which fluctuate around holidays, and contract-driven customer buying. These factors can periodically result in higher U.S. wholesaler distributor inventory levels in the United States, and therefore higher product sales. We did not experience as large of an increase in wholesaler inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 as in the prior year. Worldwide product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $14.4 billion, representing a decrease of 2% compared to 2008. U.S. product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $11.1 billion compared to $11.5 billion in 2008, representing a decrease of 3%. The decrease in U.S. product sales was largely attributable to a 24% decline in Aranesp  sales primarily reflecting the negative impact of a product safety-related label change that occurred in August 2008. Combined sales of our other products in the United States in 2009 increased 1% compared to 2008 as increased EPOGEN  sales in 2009 largely offset the decline in ENBREL sales. This decrease in ENBREL sales primarily reflects the unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 related to the shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model. International product sales were relatively unchanged at $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. International product sales for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate changes of $213 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international product sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 6%. This increase in international product sales is primarily due to the launches of Vectibix  , Mimpara  and Nplate  into our existing international markets and the expansion of Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  into new international territories. Although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to the Euro.  Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined approximately $650 million, or 7%, over 2008 of which approximately one-half of this reduction was attributable to lower legal settlements and restructuring and related costs. In addition, cost of sales declined in 2009 principally due to improved operating efficiencies and lower sales volume, partially offset by a less favorable product mix. Our RD expenses in 2009 also declined primarily due to lower clinical trial costs due to the completion of certain late-stage registrational studies for denosumab and Vectibix  . These decreases in our operating expenses were partially offset by a slight increase in our SGA expenses primarily due to increased promotional expenses, including spending for activities in advance of our anticipated launch of Prolia  . This reduction in operating expenses also reflects, in part, our continuing efforts to maintain control over discretionary expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net income was $4.6 billion, or $4.51 per share on a diluted basis, reflecting increases of 14% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. The growth in our net income principally reflects our reduced operating expenses, discussed above, and a reduction in our provision for income taxes primarily due to favorable income tax settlements of approximately $220 million and increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant. Our 2009 EPS also benefited from a reduction in our weighted average shares used to compute diluted EPS resulting from our stock repurchase program, including 59 million shares repurchased in 2009 at a total cost of $3.2 billion. Our financial condition remains strong. At December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated $13.4 billion, our total debt outstanding was $10.6 billion and our stockholders equity aggregated $22.7 billion. In addition, our cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 aggregated $6.3 billion, representing a 6% increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $530 million, which represents a decrease from $672 million in 2008 due to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2009, $12.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Looking forward, we believe that our business will continue to face various regulatory, reimbursement and competitive challenges. In particular, our ESA products, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , will continue to be impacted by regulatory developments, such as the REMS, which has been recently approved by the FDA, and recent or potential future product label changes, including any that may result from the advisory committee meeting proposed by the FDA to be held in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs in CKD. In the United States, we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Reimbursement challenges may result from the MEDCAC meeting scheduled for March 24, 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD and the provisions of the CMS proposed rule to implement a bundling prospective payment system for ESRD. In addition, the outcome of the proposed healthcare reform in the United States is very much uncertain at this time. Further, certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure, including our marketed products in the United States, in particular ENBREL as well as from biosimilar and other products in Europe which compete with Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We also have various opportunities to grow our business in the future, primarily due to our late-stage product candidate, denosumab. We continue to work with the FDA regarding our BLA for Prolia  . On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia  in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. Additionally, in December 2009, the CHMP announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. Furthermore, we announced positive study results from three phase 3 denosumab trials in the treatment of bone metastases that will form the basis of the clinical evidence package for denosumab in advanced cancer, which will be submitted to regulatory authorities later  in 2010. We also expect the results in 2010 of an additional phase 3 study to evaluate denosumab in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer to prevent bone metastases. In addition, international expansion into emerging markets will also be an important opportunity for growth. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change   2008  Change   2007 Aranesp   $ 2,652  (15 )%  $ 3,137  (13 )%  $ 3,614 EPOGEN    2,569  5 %   2,456  (1 )%   2,489 Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN    4,643  0 %   4,659  9 %   4,277 ENBREL   3,493  (3 )%   3,598  11 %   3,230 Sensipar    651  9 %   597  29 %   463 Other   343  43 %   240  1 %   238            Total product sales  $ 14,351  (2 )%  $ 14,687  3 %  $ 14,311            Total U.S.  $ 11,135  (3 )%  $ 11,460  0 %  $ 11,443 Total International   3,216  0 %   3,227  13 %   2,868            Total product sales  $ 14,351  (2 )%  $ 14,687  3 %  $ 14,311            ##TABLE_END Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including: demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, government programs, regulatory developments or guidelines, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, contracting and pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, patient population growth, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, new product launches and indications, expansion into new countries, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. In addition, general economic conditions may effect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. (See  Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates  for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Aranesp  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change   2008  Change   2007 Aranesp   U.S.  $ 1,251  (24 )%  $ 1,651  (23 )%  $ 2,154 Aranesp   International   1,401  (6 )%   1,486  2 %   1,460            Total Aranesp   $ 2,652  (15 )%  $ 3,137  (13 )%  $ 3,614            ##TABLE_END U.S. Aranesp  sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 24%. U.S. sales of Aranesp  in 2008 benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves. Excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates, U.S. sales of Aranesp  decreased approximately 21% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was principally driven by a decline in demand reflecting the negative impact, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of a product safety-related label change which occurred in August 2008 and a low single digit decrease in the average net sales price. In addition, the decline in sales also reflects both a decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share.  International Aranesp  sales for year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 6%, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately $85 million, international Aranesp  sales remained unchanged. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the negative impact on demand, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of physician conformance to regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of 2007, additional product label changes which occurred in 2008, and to a lesser extent, loss of segment share. The decline in demand was partially offset by an increase in the average net sales price. In addition, U.S. sales of Aranesp  for the year ended December 31, 2008 benefited from a slight change in an accounting estimate related to product sales return reserves. The regulatory and reimbursement developments negatively impacting sales, included (i) the loss of Aranesp  for use in the treatment AoC following the reported results of our AoC phase 3 study in February 2007, (ii) various ESA product safety-related label changes in the United States during 2008 and 2007 and (iii) the CMS NCD issued in July 2007, which significantly restricted Medicare reimbursement for use of Aranesp  in chemotherapy induced anemia (CIA) and which we believe has also negatively impacted Aranesp  use in CIA for patients covered by private insurance plans. The increase in international Aranesp  sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted sales growth by approximately $104 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp  sales decreased 5%. This decrease reflects dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs in Europe, which resulted in an overall decrease in the ESA market. In addition to other factors mentioned in the  Product sales  section above, future Aranesp  sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    regulatory developments, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the REMS for our ESAs, which has been recently approved by the FDA, or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the ESA product label changes reflecting certain results of our TREAT study (TREAT label changes); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the proposed FDA advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs to treat anemia in patients with CKD; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    future product label changes, including those we are currently discussing with regulatory authorities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the CMS MEDCAC meeting in March 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    governments and/or third-party payers reaction to regulatory developments, including the REMS for our ESAs, the TREAT label changes and future product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments , including Medicare and Medicaid; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cost containment pressures by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our ability to maintain worldwide segment share and differentiate Aranesp  from current and potential future competitive therapies or products, including JJs Epoetin alfa product marketed in the United States and certain other locations outside of the United States and other competitors products outside of the United States, including biosimilar products that have been launched; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    proposed healthcare reform in the United States; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our contracting and related pricing strategies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    patient population growth; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expansion into new international territories. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp  . See  Item 1. Business  Key Developments,   Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates  and  Item 1A. Risk Factors  herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change   2008  Change   2007 EPOGEN   U.S.  $ 2,569  5 %  $ 2,456  (1 )%  $ 2,489 ##TABLE_END EPOGEN  sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 5%, primarily due to an increase in demand. The increase in demand was principally due to patient population growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in the average net sales price. The 1% decrease in EPOGEN  sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in demand, reflecting a decline in the average net sales price. The increase in demand resulting from patient population growth was offset by a decline in dose/utilization in certain settings. The decline in dose/utilization was related to various ESA product safety-related label changes during 2008 and 2007 and the CMS revision to its EMP, which became effective January 1, 2008. We believe that the EMP implementation significantly impacted physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends, as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation. However, this dose decline subsequently moderated throughout 2008. In addition to other factors mentioned in the  Product sales  section above, future EPOGEN  sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, such as the CMS proposed rule to implement the bundled prospective payment system, which becomes effective in 2011, for dialysis services, drugs and biologicals furnished for treatment of ESRD that are currently billed separately; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the federal governments reaction to regulatory developments, including the REMS for our ESAs, which has been recently approved by the FDA, and future product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the CMS MEDCAC meeting in March 2010 to examine currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cost containment pressures from the federal and state governments on healthcare providers; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    regulatory developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the REMS for our ESAs or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the proposed FDA advisory committee meeting in 2010 to re-evaluate the use of ESAs in CKD; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    future product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices to maintain patient Hb levels in the 10 to 12 g/dL range; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    proposed healthcare reform in the United States; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, including changes in medical guidelines and legislative actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our contracting and related pricing strategies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in dose utilization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    development of new modalities or therapies to treat anemia associated with CRF; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    patient population growth. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN  . See  Item 1. Business  Key Developments,   Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates  and  Item 1A. Risk Factors  for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change   2008  Change   2007 Neulasta   U.S.  $ 2,527  1 %  $ 2,505  7 %  $ 2,351 NEUPOGEN   U.S.   901  1 %   896  4 %   861            U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total   3,428  1 %   3,401  6 %   3,212            Neulasta   International   828  2 %   813  25 %   649 NEUPOGEN   International   387  (13 )%   445  7 %   416            International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total   1,215  (3 )%   1,258  18 %   1,065            Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   $ 4,643  (0 )%  $ 4,659  9 %  $ 4,277            ##TABLE_END U.S. sales of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 1%, primarily due to a low single digit increase in demand partially offset by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in demand was principally due to an increase in the average net sales price. International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 3%, due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately $94 million,  international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales increased 4%. The increase in demand was primarily due to the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  to Neulasta  and expansion into new international territories. The increase in U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflects an increase in demand for Neulasta  driven by an increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a slight decline in units sold. The increase in international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects increased demand principally driven by continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  to Neulasta  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by $86 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales increased 10% compared to 2007. In addition to other factors mentioned in the  Product sales  section above, future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    competitive products, including biosimilar products that have been or may be approved and launched in the EU (see  Item 1.

Risk Factors  for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change   2008  Change   2007 ENBREL  U.S.  $ 3,283  (3 )%  $ 3,389  11 %  $ 3,052 ENBREL  Canada   210  0 %   209  17 %   178            Total ENBREL  $ 3,493  (3 )%  $ 3,598  11 %  $ 3,230            ##TABLE_END ENBREL sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined 3%, which primarily reflects an unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008  related to a shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model, partially offset by an increase in demand. The increase in demand was driven by a mid-single digit increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a decline in units sold due to share declines as a result of competitive activity. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects higher demand principally due to increases in the average net sales price. ENBREL sales were also favorably impacted by approximately $100 million due to a change in our distribution model for ENBREL. Previously, ENBREL was shipped directly to pharmacies. However, beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2008, we commenced using a wholesaler distributor model, similar to our other marketed products. Also, ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 was affected by share declines in the rheumatology and dermatology segments in the United States compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity. However, sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology. In addition to other factors mentioned in the  Product sales  section above, future ENBREL sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    the effects of competing products or therapies, including new competitive products coming to market, such as Centocor Ortho Biotechs Simponi  (golimumab) and Stelara  (ustekinumab) and UCB/Nektar Therapeutics Cimzia  (PEGylated anti-TNF alpha) (see  Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates ) and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on a combination of its safety profile and efficacy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    proposed healthcare reform in the United States; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    severity and duration of the current global economic downturn; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    future product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk management activities, including the proposed modification to our REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    growth in the rheumatology and dermatology segments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our product; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our contracting and related pricing strategies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    patient population growth. ##TABLE_END See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales.  Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  Change  2008  Change  2007 Operating expenses:      Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets)  $ 2,091  (9)%  $ 2,296  (10)%  $ 2,548 % of product sales   15%    16%    18% Research and development  $ 2,864  (5)%  $ 3,030  (7)%  $ 3,266 % of product sales   20%    21%    23% Selling, general and administrative  $ 3,820  1%  $ 3,789  13%  $ 3,361 % of product sales   27%    26%    23% Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets  $ 294  0%  $ 294  (1)%  $ 298 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development  $   0%  $   (100)%  $ 590 Other charges  $ 67  (82)%  $ 380  (48)%  $ 728 ##TABLE_END Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, (Cost of sales) decreased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by lower excess capacity charges, lower royalty expenses and lower sales volume, partially offset by less favorable product mix and higher fill and finish costs resulting from lower utilization at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. The decrease in Cost of sales was also driven by lower excess inventory write-offs, primarily due to the $84 million write-off of inventory in 2008 resulting from a strategic decision to change manufacturing processes. Cost of sales decreased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges incurred in 2008, as discussed below. In addition, the decline in Cost of sales was due to lower inventory write-offs and lower cost ENBREL, partially offset by higher sales volume and excess capacity charges. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $1 million, $6 million and $150 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. The restructuring charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate closure of one of our ENBREL commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities. See Note 9,  Restructuring  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses include costs incurred under RD arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs and cost recoveries associated with collaborative RD and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies that have no alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs for RD collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. RD expenses decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decline was primarily attributable to lower clinical trial costs of $128 million, including those associated with our denosumab and Vectibix  registrational studies, our marketed products and the delay of the phase 3 motesanib NSCLC trial, and $14 million lower staff-related costs. Additionally, we incurred higher licensing fees, in 2009, related to the  $60 million expense associated with the Array BioPharma Inc. agreement and the $50 million expense resulting from the payment to Cytokinetics, partially offset by the $100 million expense in 2008 resulting from the upfront payment associated with the Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kyowa Hakko) collaboration. RD expenses decreased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, which was principally due to $102 million of lower staff-related costs and discretionary expenses; $133 million of lower clinical trial costs; $100 million of cost recoveries derived from our licensing agreements, primarily with Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda and a $16 million decline in restructuring-related costs, as discussed below, partially offset by a $100 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2008 for the upfront payment under our licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko. Our clinical trial costs were lower for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the completion of enrollment of our large denosumab clinical trials and the related significant costs associated with site initiation and patient enrollment no longer being incurred, partially offset by increased clinical costs for our emerging pipeline. RD expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $6 million, $3 million and $19 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. The restructuring charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily related to $38 million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a $19 million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees termination. See Note 9,  Restructuring  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SGA expenses include costs and cost recoveries associated with certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs for collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. In connection with a co-promotion agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada and Pfizer is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBRELs profits owed to Pfizer is included in SGA expenses. SGA expenses increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher product promotional expenses of $207 million, including increased spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia  . This increase was substantially offset by lower litigation expenses of $38 million, lower expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share of $32 million, expense recoveries associated with our GSK collaboration agreement for Prolia  in PMO in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico of $29 million, lower staff-related costs of $28 million, lower global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system related expenses of $28 million and lower restructuring and related costs of $8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the expense associated with the Pfizer profit share was $1,163 million and $1,195 million, respectively. SGA expense increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, in part due to the impact of our restructuring plan which contributed $161 million to the increase in expenses, as discussed below. The increase was also due to higher expense associated with the Pfizer profit share of $211 million, product promotional spending of $39 million and staff-related costs of $94 million, partially offset by lower litigation expense of $50 million and lower severance costs of $21 million related to our acquisition of the remaining 51% ownership interest in Domp. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the expense associated with the Pfizer profit share, excluding recoveries recorded as part of our restructuring, as discussed below, was $984 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $29 million for certain cost saving initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $37 million for certain restructuring charges, which primarily included $17 million in asset impairments, $12 million in loss accruals for leases principally related to certain facilities that will not be used in our business and $9 million in implementation costs associated with certain restructuring initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $114 million in cost recoveries for  certain restructuring charges, principally with respect to accelerated depreciation, in connection with our co-promotion agreement with Pfizer and $11 million of benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees termination. See Note 9,  Restructuring  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2007, amortization expense also included $3 million related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, prior to January 1, 2009, the fair value of acquired IPRD projects, which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition, were immediately expensed. In 2007, we wrote-off $270 million and $320 million of acquired IPRD related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa, respectively. The Alantos IPRD amount is related to an orally-administered treatment for type II diabetes that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2a clinical trials. The Ilypsa IPRD amount is related to a phosphate binder that, at the date of acquisition, was in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. We used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired IPRD, which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs. These success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. The estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of 38% for the Alantos product candidate and 77% for the Ilypsa product candidate. The incremental RD expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the Alantos and Ilypsa product candidates are immaterial. The above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition. However, we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize, as estimated. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition. We are continuing to develop the product candidate acquired in the Alantos acquisition. We have reviewed data from recently-completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for AMG 223, the product candidate acquired in the Ilypsa acquisition. The results were consistent with what is likely required for registration of a phosphate-binding therapy. However, in the context of our overall development portfolio, the Company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product. In addition, in 2006, we wrote-off acquired IPRD related to the acquisition of Abgenix. The IPRD amount was primarily related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with Abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and related to a royalty that we would have owed to Abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of Abgenixs patented technologies in the development of this product candidate (see Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates ). The elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring  any incremental RD expenses. Panitumumab was Abgenixs fully human monoclonal antibody which, at acquisition, was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer. The incremental RD expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately $300 million and would be incurred through 2011 and there have been no significant changes in these estimates. At the date of acquisition, we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer. In 2006, panitumumab received FDA approval for the treatment of mCRC after disease progression on, or following, fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark Vectibix  . In December 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix  as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. This conditional approval is reviewed annually by the CHMP, and in December 2008 we agreed as a condition of the renewal of approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication. The conditional approval was granted again in December 2009. We are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop Vectibix  in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition. However, since the acquisition, there have been several events that have affected the development plans for Vectibix  and because of these developments, our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed and the expected cost to obtain necessary approvals has increased compared to our original expectations. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates and Item 1. Business  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates for developments related to Vectibix  and denosumab. Other charges As discussed in Note 9,  Restructuring  to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant RD investments and build the framework for our future growth. Subsequently, we identified certain additional initiatives designed to further assist in improving our cost structure. As a result of these restructuring and related charges, we recorded in Other charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007 expenses for staff separation costs of $30 million, $7 million and $209 million, respectively, asset impairments of $36 million and $366 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and charges of $4 million, $49 million and $119 million, respectively, primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business. Also, in 2009, the Company recorded in Other charges loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. Also, in 2008, the Company recorded in Other charges loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, principally related to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. In addition, in 2007, the Company recorded a $34 million loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding. Interest expense, net For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest expense, net was $578 million, $551 million and $496 million, respectively. Included in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $250 million, $235 million and $168 million, respectively, resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt. (See Note 2, Change in method of accounting for convertible debt instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Interest and other income, net Interest and other income, net decreased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This decline is primarily due to lower interest income of $45 million, principally due to lower portfolio investment returns; lower net gains on sales of investments of $28 million; and higher losses on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations of $31 million; partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange  net gains of $27 million. Interest and other income, net increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase is primarily due to higher net gains on sales of investments of $79 million; higher interest income of $20 million, principally due to higher portfolio investment returns; partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange net losses of $34 million. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 11.5%, 19.2% and 18.9% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2009 decreased over 2008 primarily due to: (i) the favorable resolution of certain prior years matters with tax authorities, (ii) higher profits and manufacturing in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant, and (iii) a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years tax matters recognized in the year ended December 31, 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 4.2%. Our effective tax rate for 2008 remained relatively unchanged from 2007. Although the 2007 effective tax rate benefited from the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations, this benefit was substantially offset by the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPRD costs, resulting in a comparable effective tax rate between the two years. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Income taxes  and Note 5, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. This standard also replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, this standard requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to make ongoing assessments of whether it has a controlling financial interest in the variable interest entity and to provide enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in the variable interest entity. This standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element of goods and/or services. This standard addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and removes the previous separation criteria that objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any undelivered item must exist for the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting. This standard also addresses how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each deliverable. Finally, this standard expands disclosures related to multiple element revenue arrangements. This standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data. The amounts reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard which changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt (see Note 2, Change in method of accounting for convertible debt instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our adoption of this new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2009) (in millions): ##TABLE_START   December 31,   2009  2008 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  $ 13,442  $ 9,552 Total assets   39,629   36,427 Current debt      1,000 Non-current debt   10,601   8,352 Stockholders equity   22,667   20,885 ##TABLE_END We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. ) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2009, approximately $12.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objectives for our marketable security investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.  Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements and the amounts reflect, where applicable, the adoption of the new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for our convertible debt (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   December 31,   2009  2008 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes)  $ 2,342  $ 2,206 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes)   2,088   1,970 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes)   1,099   1,099 4.00% notes due 2009 (2009 Notes)      1,000 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes)   1,000   1,000 5.70% notes due 2019 (2019 Notes)   998    6.40% notes due 2039 (2039 Notes)   995    6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes)   899   899 6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes)   499   499 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes)   499   498 Zero-coupon modified convertible notes due in 2032 (2032 Modified Convertible Notes)   82   81 8.125% notes due 2097 (Other)   100   100       Total borrowings   10,601   9,352 Less current portion      1,000       Total non-current debt  $ 10,601  $ 8,352       ##TABLE_END In November 2009, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% (the 2009 Notes) became due and were repaid. In January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the 2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the 2039 Notes) in a registered offering. The 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.70% and 6.40%, respectively. The 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole amount, as defined. Upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $13 million and are being amortized over the lives of the notes. In May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the 2038 Notes) in a registered offering. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 6.15% and 6.90%, respectively. The 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a make-whole amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $6 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. Upon the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes discussed above, in June 2008 we exercised our right to call and repaid $1.0 billion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes which were scheduled to mature in November 2008. In November 2008, the remaining $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes became due and were repaid. As of December 31, 2009, we had $7.6 billion of additional notes outstanding. The notes consisted of (i) $2.3 billion of convertible notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.125% and mature in February 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes), (ii) $2.1 billion of convertible notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.375% and mature in February 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes), (iii) $1.1 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of  5.85% and mature in 2017 (2017 Notes), (iv) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (2014 Notes), (v) $899 million of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375% and mature in 2037 (2037 Notes), (vi) $100 million of other long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.125% and mature in 2097 and (vii) zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $82 million and having an aggregate face amount of $105 million and yield to maturity of 1.125%. See Note 16, Financing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our Convertible Notes. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2009, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2014 Notes and 2018 Notes, with an aggregate face value of $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes and other notes, with an aggregate face value of $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.3 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2009, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility which matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. Annual commitment fees for this facility are 0.045% based on our current credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program. All of the $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, no securities were outstanding under the $400 million medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2009. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. Our outstanding convertible notes and other outstanding long-term debt are rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard  Poors, A3 with a stable outlook by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and A with a stable outlook by Fitch, Inc. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009   2008   2007  Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 6,336   $ 5,988   $ 5,401  Net cash used in investing activities   (3,202 )   (3,165 )   (1,992 ) Net cash used in financing activities   (2,024 )   (3,073 )   (2,668 ) ##TABLE_END Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2009 primarily due to higher net income of $553 million and a higher dividend payment from KA of $102 million partially offset by the prior year receipt of  $300 million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with Takeda; and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2008 primarily as a result of improvement in operating income. Investing Net purchases of marketable securities were $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to net purchases of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and net purchases of $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $530 million in 2009, $672 million in 2008 and $1.3 billion in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. Capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and investment in our global ERP system and other information systems projects. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Puerto Rico and other locations and investment in our global ERP system. We currently estimate 2010 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million. On January 4, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Domp and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $56 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $398 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $299 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $1 million. Financing In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock adding to the $5.0 billion previously authorized in July 2007. As of December 31, 2009, we had $6.0 billion available for stock repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2009  2008   2007   Shares  Dollars  Shares  Dollars   Shares   Dollars First quarter  37.5  $ 1,997    $    8.8   $ 537 Second quarter       32.7   1,549 (1)   73.9 (2)    4,463 Third quarter          19 (1)   2.5 (2)     Fourth quarter  21.7   1,211  12.6   700   1.8    100                  Total  59.2  $ 3,208  45.3  $ 2,268   87.0   $ 5,100                  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR program entered into in May 2008. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) The total number of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2007 excludes 2.5 million shares received in July 2007 in connection with the final settlement of an ASR entered into in May 2007. ##TABLE_END As discussed above, in January 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 resulting in net proceeds received of $2.0 billion. In November 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion of 4.00% notes that matured. As discussed above, in May 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 resulting in net proceeds received of $991  million. In June 2008, upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of these notes, we exercised our right to call and repaid $1.0 billion of floating rate notes scheduled to mature in November 2008 and in November 2008, we repaid the remaining $1.0 billion of floating rate notes that matured. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2008 Floating Rate Notes, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due in 2037, resulting in net proceeds of $4.0 billion. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an ASR entered into in May 2007. On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. In addition $135 million of other debt securities matured and were repaid in 2007. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $171 million, $155 million and $277 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START Contractual obligations  Payments due by period  Total  Less than 1 year  2-3 years  4-5 years  More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1)  $ 17,736  $ 323  $ 3,276  $ 4,225  $ 9,912 Operating lease obligations   1,017   136   231   184   466 Purchase obligations (2)   3,715   939   793   278   1,705                Total contractual obligations  $ 22,468  $ 1,398  $ 4,300  $ 4,687  $ 12,083                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2011 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.125%, the 2013 Convertible Notes at a fixed rate of 0.375%, the 2017 Notes at a fixed rate of 5.85%, the 2014 Notes at a fixed rate of 4.85%, the 2019 Notes at a fixed rate of 5.70%, the 2039 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.40%, the 2037 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.375%, the 2018 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.15%, the 2038 Notes at a fixed rate of 6.90% and the other notes at a fixed rate of 8.125%. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2009 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (2) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and (v) our agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which we entered into on October 22, 2008, for certain information systems infrastructure services. The term of the agreement is five years with three one-year renewals, at our option, for a total of up to eight years. The cost to us for the initial five-year term, is estimated to be $505 million, included in the table above is $363 million for the remaining obligation. The estimated aggregate additional cost of the three one-year renewal options not included in the table above is approximately $219 million. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END Long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (net of federal tax benefits on state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, we do not have any liabilities for UTBs classified as current liabilities. In addition to the above table, we are contractually obligated to make potential future success-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third-parties. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and, given the nature of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, we may be required to pay such amounts. As payment of these amounts is not considered probable, these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Further, the timing of any future payment is not reasonable estimable. Individually, future payment of any amounts under these arrangements is not expected to be material in any one reporting period. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangement is approximately $1.8 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale.  We analyze the adequacy of our sales deductions accruals each quarter. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets regarding sales deductions (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Rebates   Chargebacks   Cash discounts   Other deductions   Total  Balance as of January 1, 2007  $ 788   $ 73   $ 36   $ 182   $ 1,079  Amounts charged against product sales   2,156    1,649    337    357    4,499  Payments   (2,189 )   (1,652 )   (331 )   (342 )   (4,514 )                     Balance as of December 31, 2007   755    70    42    197    1,064  Amounts charged against product sales   1,813    1,635    324    466    4,238  Payments   (2,064 )   (1,621 )   (323 )   (418 )   (4,426 )                     Balance as of December 31, 2008   504    84    43    245    876  Amounts charged against product sales   1,497    2,424    312    406    4,639  Payments   (1,482 )   (2,380 )   (328 )   (355 )   (4,545 )                     Balance as of December 31, 2009  $ 519   $ 128   $ 27   $ 296   $ 970                      ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total sales deductions were 24%, 22% and 24% of gross product sales. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 2% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009. In late 2008 we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers (reflected as chargebacks in the table above) instead of rebates, resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks, as noted in the table above. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using data from our wholesalers and other third-parties and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are primarily based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates earned by healthcare providers in the United States may include performance-based offers, such as attaining contractually-specified segment share or other performance-based measures. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 3.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 3.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2009 would have had an impact of approximately $52 million on our 2009 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.  Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. In connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory, we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidates safety and efficacy, the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns. In addition, we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as considering the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date. Upon capitalization, we continue to monitor any changes in these factors. In the event of any significant negative developments, we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs. At December 31, 2009, we had capitalized approximately $258 million of inventory costs related to our late-stage product candidate, Prolia  . In the United States, Prolia  is currently being reviewed by the FDA for use in the treatment of PMO in women. On February 19, 2010, we announced that the FDA has evaluated the content of our Complete Response submission for Prolia  in the treatment of PMO, which we submitted on January 25, 2010, and classified it as a Class 2 resubmission. With the Class 2 designation, the FDA set a corresponding PDUFA action date of July 25, 2010. In addition in December 2009, the CHMP announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. If approved by the European Commission, we would receive marketing authorization for Prolia  in all EU Member States. The timing of actual launch dates would vary by country based on reimbursement authority approval of pricing which could follow the EMA approval by many months. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or  resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Companys tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, substantial reform of U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 20,  Contingencies and commitments  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries. We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. Short-term interest rates on U.S. treasury instruments have declined considerably while other short-term rates have fluctuated in excess of historical norms. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Similarly, over this same period there has been extraordinary  volatility in the currency markets, and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was comprised primarily of U.S. treasury securities; obligations of U.S. government agencies and FDIC guaranteed bank debt; corporate debt securities; mortgage and asset backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest bearing securities, principally comprised of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $13.3 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $10.6 billion and a fair value of $11.6 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $9.4 billion and a fair value of $9.8 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2009, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $760 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2008, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $560 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a LIBOR-based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts. We enter into forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2009, we had open forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $376 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we had open forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $2.5 billion and $386 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the net unrealized losses and at December 31, 2008 the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $720 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 20% adverse  movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2008, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $550 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $260 million. Also at December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had open forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $414 million and $472 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2009 and 2008. With regard to forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2009 and 2008 a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 would not have had a material impact on fair value on these dates or would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive instruments As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2009. Management determined that, as of December 31, 2009, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California March 1, 2010  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our or us) is the worlds largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We were incorporated in 1980 and organized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. Our public website is www.amgen.com. On our website, investors can find press releases, financial filings and other information about the Company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, www.sec.gov, also offers access to reports and documents we have electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. As of December 31, 2010, we had 17,400 staff members worldwide. Approximately 6,700 of our staff members work in our research and development (RD) function, approximately 4,600 work in manufacturing, approximately 4,200 work in our commercial operations and the rest are in general and administrative functions. Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products are: Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that stimulate the production of red blood cells; Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), a pegylated protein, based on the Filgrastim molecule, and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), both of which selectively stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection); and Enbrel  (etanercept), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a substance that plays a role in the bodys response to inflammatory diseases. Our principal products represented 91%, 93% and 94% of our sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our other marketed products include: Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), a small molecule calcimimetic that lowers serum calcium levels; Vectibix  (panitumumab), a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr); and Nplate  (romiplostim), a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that mimics endogenous TPO, the primary driver of platelet production. In addition, in 2010 we launched Prolia  (denosumab) and XGEVA tm (denosumab) both of which contain the same active ingredient but which are approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets RANKL, an essential regulator of osteoclasts (the cells that break down bone). We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada. We have also entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization and marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships.) Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which influence demand. The reimbursement environment continues to evolve with greater emphasis on both cost containment and demonstration of the economic value of products. In addition to our marketed products, we have various product candidates in mid-to-late stage development in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neurology. Our RD organization has expertise in multiple treatment modalities, including large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) and small molecules. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities for all of our principal products as well as most of our product candidates. We operate commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are very long  approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Upon approval, marketed products in our industry generally face substantial competition. Our industry is also highly regulated, and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business. Government authorities in the United States and other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products as well as our ongoing RD activities. In recent years, regulators have placed a greater scrutiny on drug safety. This has led to, and may in the future lead to: fewer products being approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory bodies; delays in receiving approvals; additional safety-related requirements; restrictions on the use of products, including expanded safety labeling, or required risk management activities. Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments that occurred in 2010 and early 2011 affecting our business. A more detailed discussion of each development follows in the appropriate section. Denosumab ##TABLE_START   The FDA approved Prolia  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture.    The European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures.    The FDA approved XGEVA tm for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. XGEVA tm is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma.    We submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for denosumab for the reduction of SREs in cancer patients.    We announced that a phase 3 trial evaluating XGEVA tm versus placebo in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint by significantly improving bone metastasis-free survival. This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer. ##TABLE_END Healthcare Reform ##TABLE_START   A new healthcare reform law was enacted in the United States that, among other provisions, imposes additional costs on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars. ##TABLE_END ESAs ##TABLE_START   The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) released its Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis, effective January 1, 2011, which provides a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs that were previously reimbursed separately (except for oral drugs without intravenous equivalents for which the bundling rules have been postponed). ##TABLE_END 2 ##TABLE_START   CMS engaged in a number of activities to examine the use of ESAs in certain patients with kidney disease, including holding a March 2010 meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development  Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC), opening a National Coverage Analysis (NCA) in June 2010 to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis-related anemia as well as holding another MEDCAC meeting in January 2011 to review the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival.    We announced that the FDA approved a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ESAs that requires, among other elements, that healthcare providers and institutions who prescribe ESAs to patients with cancer receive additional training and document their risk discussions with their cancer patients prior to initiating a new course of ESA therapy. Healthcare providers and institutions who fail to comply with the REMS program requirements, including enrolling in the ESA REMS program and meeting ongoing compliance obligations, will have their access to ESAs suspended. Beginning February 16, 2011, we must ensure that our distributors do not ship ESAs to any healthcare provider or institution until such provider or institution has enrolled in the ESA APPRISE (Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe use of ESAs) Oncology Program.    We are working with the FDA to determine the appropriate use of ESAs in CKD patients and to determine any future ESA labeling changes required in connection with our Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp  Therapy (TREAT) study or the October 2010 Cardiovascular and Renal Drug Advisory Committee (CRDAC) meeting. ##TABLE_END Vectibix  ##TABLE_START   We submitted our application to the EMA for marketing authorization for the use of Vectibix  in first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients whose tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes.    We filed supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) submissions with the FDA for first- and second-line mCRC.    We announced that a phase 3 trial evaluating Vectibix  as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint. ##TABLE_END Other Developments ##TABLE_START   We initiated a phase 3 study in recurrent ovarian cancer for AMG 386.    We announced plans to begin a phase 3 study in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer for ganitumab (AMG 479).    We announced that we anticipate data for a phase 3 motesanib study for advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first half of 2011.    We recently announced an agreement to acquire BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex). BioVex is a privately held biotechnology company developing treatments for cancer and the prevention of infectious disease, including OncoVEX GM-CSF , a novel oncology vaccine in phase 3 trials for the treatment of melanoma and head and neck cancer. The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the three months ended March 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END Marketed Products We market our principal products, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and ENBREL in supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Certain of our marketed products face, and our product candidates, if approved, are also expected to face, substantial competition, including from products marketed by large pharmaceutical corporations, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. Our products competitive position among other biological and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement and patent position and expirations. Over the next several years, the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilar products. A biosimilar product is a follow-on version of another biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product. This demonstration will typically consist of comparative analytical, preclinical and clinical data from the biosimilar product to show that it has similar safety and efficacy as the reference product. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a new, abbreviated pathway. Consequently, we expect to face greater competition, including from manufacturers with biosimilar products approved in Europe that may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. In the European Union (EU), we are already facing increasing competition from biosimilars given an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the EU. Further, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products, particularly in supportive cancer care, or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition to the challenges presented by competition, our existing products and product candidates are also subject to increasing regulatory compliance requirements that could be imposed as conditions of approval or after a product has been approved. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While such therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve relatively new or higher levels of scientific complexity and may therefore generate increased safety concerns. As a condition of approval or due to safety concerns after a product has been approved, we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or studies. A postmarketing requirement (PMR) is a trial or study that a sponsor company is required by statute or regulation to conduct. A postmarketing commitment (PMC) is a trial or study that a sponsor company agrees to in writing, but is not required by law, to conduct. We currently have PMRs or PMCs for a number of our marketed products. In addition, we may be required to implement risk management plans for our products in the various regions in which they are approved. For example, in 2008 the FDA began requiring REMS for various approved products to ensure that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. A REMS may also be imposed as a condition of approval or after a product has been on the market. A REMS may include a medication guide or a patient package insert, a healthcare provider communication plan or elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor company to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA evaluates such assessments and may require additional modifications to the REMS elements. REMS may also be modified as the FDA and companies gain more experience with REMS and how they are implemented, operated and monitored. We currently have REMS for a number of our marketed products. (See discussion on PMRs, PMCs and REMS in Government Regulation.) ESAs Aranesp  and EPOGEN  are our registered trademarks for darbepoetin alfa and Epoetin alfa, respectively, both of which are ESAs, proteins that stimulate red blood cell production. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count can result in anemia, a condition in which insufficient oxygen is delivered to the bodys organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in patients either on or not on dialysis. Individuals with CRF suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with non-myeloid malignancies. ESA products, including ours, have faced and continue to face challenges. For example, based on adverse safety results observed beginning in late 2006 in various ESA studies, performed by us and by others, that explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label, the product labeling of our ESA products in the United States and the EU has been updated several times to reflect those safety concerns. In addition, due in part to certain of these developments, reimbursement of our ESA products in the United States was also revised resulting in changes in the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, including by decreasing the number of treated patients, average dose and duration of ESA therapy. Certain of these developments have had a material adverse impact on sales of our ESA products, in particular Aranesp  sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting, reflecting an overall decline in the segment. Further, we believe that the following recent and pending developments could also have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp  and/or EPOGEN  : ##TABLE_START   On January 1, 2011, the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective which provides a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs, supplies, and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. Under the Final Rule, dialysis providers were given the choice of opting into the new bundled payment system in its entirety on January 1, 2011, or phasing in over time. Substantially all dialysis providers in the United States have opted into the bundled payment system in its entirety. We expect the bundled payment system to decrease dose utilization of EPOGEN  and that this decrease will have a material adverse impact on our EPOGEN  sales.    On March 24, 2010, CMS held a MEDCAC meeting to examine the currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD. Although there was no clear outcome from the MEDCAC meeting, on June 16, 2010, CMS opened an NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia, which is generally CMSs first step toward developing a National Coverage Determination (NCD). Generally, an NCD is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage or reimbursement for a specific medical item or service. Medicare currently does not have an NCD for the use of ESAs for anemia in patients who have CKD but has historically reimbursed for the use of ESAs in this setting. CMS has stated that the NCA process for ESAs will conclude on or before June 16, 2011, but CMS could propose an NCD at any time prior to that deadline. In addition, on January 19, 2011, CMS held another MEDCAC meeting, this time to review the available evidence on the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival.    On February 16, 2010, Amgen and Centocor Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. (Centocor), a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson (JJ), announced that the FDA had approved a REMS for ESAs which includes Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa), a product marketed by JJ. In order to ensure continued access to ESAs for healthcare providers and institutions who prescribe ESAs to patients with cancer, healthcare providers and institutions are required to train and enroll in the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program. Enrolled healthcare providers and institutions are required to document that a discussion about the risks of ESAs took place with each patient prior to the initiation of each new course of ESA therapy. Beginning February 16, 2011, we must ensure that our distributors do not ship ESAs to any healthcare provider or institution until such provider or institution is enrolled in the APPRISE program. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the REMS and for providing the FDA with periodic assessment reports to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. Healthcare providers and institutions that fail to comply with the APPRISE program requirements will have their access to ESAs suspended. Direct patient registration or approval prior to ESA administration is not required through the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program. As required, we will work with the FDA if it is determined any modifications to the REMS are needed based on the REMS assessments we submit.    On October 18, 2010, the FDA held a CRDAC meeting to review results from the TREAT study conducted in CRF patients not on dialysis with type-2 diabetes and moderate anemia, and how those results inform the appropriate use of ESAs in patients with CKD. Prior to the CRDAC meeting, we submitted for the FDAs review proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) levels 10 grams per deciliter (g/dL)), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom ##TABLE_END 5 ##TABLE_START  transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In addition to narrowing the patient population, we are proposing a more conservative dosing algorithm in those patients. We are working with the FDA to determine the appropriate use of ESAs in CKD patients and to determine any future ESA labeling changes required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   We are working with the FDA to make ESA product package insert changes associated with the Physicians Labeling Rule (PLR) conversion process. During the process of converting from the existing format to the new PLR format, the FDA and Amgen are evaluating the package insert information to ensure that it accurately reflects current knowledge and may revise, add to or remove information appearing in the old format that could substantively impact the content of the product package insert. ##TABLE_END In addition to the above, following the FDAs Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting in May 2004, we proposed a pharmacovigilance program for Aranesp  comprised of five studies to explore the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label. The studies were subsequently designated by the FDA as PMCs. Of the five studies, one was sponsored by Amgen while the other four were investigator-sponsored. Results of certain of those studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESA products and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. Of the five studies, three are complete with final results of the remaining studies expected in 2011. In addition, Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research  Development (JJPRD), a subsidiary of JJ, and/or its investigators have conducted numerous studies proposed at the 2004 ODAC meeting. All of these studies are closed to enrollment and summary results were submitted to the FDA. Based on our discussions with the FDA in response to the May 2007 ODAC meeting, we and JJPRD have carefully considered potential new study designs to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Based on those discussions, we have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing advanced NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo (Study782) as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. In addition, JJPRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study in breast cancer is also ongoing. Both studies are designated by the FDA as PMR clinical trials. Adverse events or results of any of these studies could further affect product safety labeling, healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and/or reimbursement practices related to Aranesp  . Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license by Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (KA), a joint venture between Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin) and Amgen (see Business Relationships  Kirin Holdings Company, Limited), to manufacture and market Aranesp  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We market Aranesp  primarily in the United States and Europe. Aranesp  was launched in 2001 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF (both in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Worldwide Aranesp  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.14 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, U.S. Aranesp  sales were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively, and international Aranesp  sales were $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.49 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for darbepoetin alfa are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration U.S. Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins 5/15/2024 Europe (1) Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins 8/16/2014 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Our principal European patent relating to Epoetin alfa expired in December 2004. Although we do not market EPOGEN  in Europe, upon expiration of this patent, some companies received approval to market products, including biosimilars, that compete with Aranesp  in Europe, as further discussed below. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy and/or renal failure negatively impact Aranesp  sales. In the United States, Aranesp  competes with EPOGEN  , primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Aranesp  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care and nephrology segments, unless otherwise indicated.

MIRCERA  has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF.  (5) A subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva Pharmaceutical). ##TABLE_END In addition to competition from these marketed products, the following products in development could compete with Aranesp  in the future: ##TABLE_START   Affymax Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) are co-developing peginesatide, an ESA for the treatment of anemia in CRF patients on dialysis and they have announced plans to file for regulatory approval in the United States in the second quarter of 2011.    Reliance Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. (Reliance Life Sciences) has an epoetin biosimiliar (Epostim) that they filed for regulatory approval for in Europe. ##TABLE_END 7 EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market EPOGEN  in the United States under a licensing agreement with KA. We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a subsidiary of JJ (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Centocor), a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all indications other than dialysis. (See Business Relationships  Johnson  Johnson.) We launched EPOGEN  in the United States in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF in patients who are on dialysis. We market EPOGEN  in the United States for the treatment of anemic adult and pediatric patients with CRF who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is indicated for elevating or maintaining the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or Hb measurements) and decreasing the need for blood transfusions in these patients. EPOGEN  sales in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for Epoetin alfa are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration  U.S. Process of making erythropoietin 8/15/2012 U.S. Product claims to erythropoietin 8/20/2013 U.S. Pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin 8/20/2013 U.S. Cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin 5/26/2015 ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with renal failure negatively impact EPOGEN  sales. In the United States, as noted above, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. In addition, EPOGEN  could face additional competition from those products in development noted in the Aranesp  section above that may be used in dialysis in the United States. Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with KA. (See Business Relationships  Kirin Holdings Company, Limited.) Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  stimulate production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils. Neutrophils defend against infection. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. NEUPOGEN  is our registered trademark for Filgrastim, our recombinant-methionyl human G-CSF. Neulasta  is our registered trademark for pegfilgrastim, a pegylated protein based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule (PEG) is added to enlarge the Filgrastim molecule, thereby extending its half-life and causing it to be removed more slowly from the body. Because pegfilgrastim is eliminated through binding to its receptor on neutrophils and their precursors, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN  , which requires more frequent dosing. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  are prescribed more frequently in the curative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered with the intent to cure cancer, rather than in the palliative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered to treat other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth. We market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  primarily in the United States and Europe. Filgrastim is also marketed under the brand name GRANULOKINE  in Italy. Neulasta  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Administration of Neulasta  in all cycles of chemotherapy is approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a clinically significant risk of febrile neutropenia. NEUPOGEN  was launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN  is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy; reducing the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; reducing the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in cancer patients who have undergone myeloablative chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation; and reducing the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Worldwide Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $4.8 billion, $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $3.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

Upon expiration of that patent, some companies received approval to market products, including biosimilars, that compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  in Europe, as further discussed below. Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  also face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, severe chronic neutropenia and AML. Further, NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe, and NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  . However, we believe the conversion in the United States is substantially complete and that a significant amount of the conversion in Europe has already occurred. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care setting.

On September 30, 2010, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional information from Teva Pharmaceutical to complete the review of its applications for approval of Neutroval tm . Neutroval tm is currently sold under the brand name Tevagrastim  in several European countries. If approved in the United States, this drug would compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . On November 30, 2009, Teva Pharmaceutical filed a declaratory judgment action against us alleging that certain of our NEUPOGEN  patents are invalid and not infringed by Neutroval tm , and on January 15, 2010, we filed an answer and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that our patents are valid and infringed. Pretrial proceedings are ongoing and no trial date has yet been set. (See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Other companies with short-acting filgrastims in phase 3 clinical development for Europe are: ##TABLE_START   Merck  Company, Inc. (Merck) (MK-4214).    Intas/Apotex Inc. (Neukine).    Reliance Life Sciences (Religrast).    Biocon Ltd./Celgene Corporation (Celgene) (Nufil). ##TABLE_END In addition, Teva Pharmaceutical has two long-acting filgrastims in phase 3 clinical development for Europe (XM-22 and Neugranin). Enbrel  (etanercept) ENBREL is our registered trademark for etanercept, our TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to its receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune systems ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL is similar to a protein that the body produces naturally, and like this protein, it binds certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation. We acquired the rights to ENBREL in July 2002 with our acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex). ENBREL was launched in November 1998 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, ENBREL is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: moderately to severely active RA; chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; active psoriatic arthritis; and active ankylosing spondylitis. ENBREL is also approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idopathic arthritis in patients ages 2 and older. We market ENBREL under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada, which expires in the fourth quarter of 2013. (See Business Relationships  Pfizer Inc.) The rights to market and sell ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. ENBREL sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $3.5 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for etanercept are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration  U.S. TNFR DNA vectors, cells and processes for making proteins 10/23/2012 U.S. Aqueous Formulation (1) 2/27/2023 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) This formulation patent relates to the currently approved liquid formulation of ENBREL, which formulation accounts for the majority of ENBREL sales in the United States. ENBREL is also sold as a lyophilized formulation that requires reconstituting before it can be administered to the patient. Accordingly, a potential competitor may be able to develop an alternative formulation of etanercept, including the lyophilized formulation, and compete in the marketplace prior to the expiration of the liquid formulation patent. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating rheumatologic conditions, which includes moderate to severe RA; moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis; and dermatologic conditions, which includes moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, could negatively impact ENBREL sales. Certain of the treatments for these indications include generic methotrexate and other products. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with ENBREL in the United States and Canada in the inflammatory disease setting.

Pfizer released phase 3 data for its small molecule oral JAK program (tofacitinib) in RA and has initiated phase 3 trials in psoriasis.    AstraZeneca PLC and Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. initiated phase 3 trials in RA for their small molecule (fostamatinib).    Celgene initiated phase 3 clinical trials in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis for its small molecule (apremilast). ##TABLE_END 11 In addition, several pharmaceutical companies announced their intent to produce biosimilars that may compete with ENBREL. Other Our other marketed products are Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), Vectibix  (panitumumab), Nplate  (romiplostim), Prolia  (denosumab) and XGEVA tm (denosumab). Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  is our registered trademark in the United States and Mimpara  is our registered trademark in Europe for cinacalcet, our small molecule medicine used in treating CKD patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. In 2004, Sensipar  /Mimpara  was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In 2008, Mimpara  was approved in Europe for the reduction of hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism where a parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. We market Sensipar  primarily in the United States and Mimpara  primarily in Europe. In addition, as previously discussed, CMS released the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis, effective January 1, 2011, resulting in a bundled payment system for dialysis facilities. Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will continue to be reimbursed separately under the Medicare Part D benefit until 2014 when they will be reimbursed under the bundled payment system. Inclusion in the bundled payment system may reduce utilization of these oral drugs and have a material adverse impact on Sensipar  sales. (See Reimbursement . ) Worldwide Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $714 million, $651 million and $597 million, respectively.

(Barr) for infringement of four Sensipar  patents. The lawsuit was based on Abbreviated New Drug Applications filed by Teva and Barr that sought approval to market generic versions of Sensipar  . Following trial, on January 7, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware granted an injunction prohibiting Teva and Barr from commercializing generic versions of Sensipar  in the United States until expiration of three of those patents. (See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) These generic versions could compete with Sensipar  in the future. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is our registered trademark for panitumumab, our monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens. EGFr is a protein that plays an important role in cancer cell signaling and is over-expressed in many human cancers. Vectibix  binds with high affinity to EGFrs and interferes with signals that might otherwise stimulate growth and survival of the cancer cell. We acquired full ownership of Vectibix  with our acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. (Abgenix) in April 2006. In September 2006, Vectibix  received FDA accelerated approval in the United States, based upon clinical trial data from a study demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and with the condition that Amgen conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the clinical benefit of panitumumab through demonstration of an improvement in overall survival. In the EU, the conditional approval of Vectibix  as monotherapy, for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens, was received in December 2007 and is reviewed annually by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). In December 2008, 2009 and 2010, the EU conditional marketing authorization was renewed with an additional specific obligation to conduct a clinical trial in the existing approved indication. In 2010, we began enrollment for this additional clinical trial which compares the effect of Vectibix  versus Erbitux  (cetuximab) on overall survival for chemorefractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS genes. KRAS is a protein found in all human cells. Some colorectal cancers have mutations in the KRAS gene. Vectibix  has been shown to be ineffective in people whose tumors had KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13. In 2009, we announced results from the 203 and 181 pivotal phase 3 trials evaluating Vectibix  in combination with chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) as a first- and second-line treatment for mCRC, respectively. Both studies demonstrated that Vectibix  administered with chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. Additionally, both studies showed numeric improvements in median overall survival in the same patient population. The numeric improvements in median overall survival failed to achieve statistical significance. It was previously agreed with the FDA that the 181 study would serve as the confirmatory trial for establishing full approval for the mCRC indication. On April 16, 2010, our application for marketing authorization for the use of Vectibix  in first- and second-line treatment of mCRC in patients whose tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes was submitted to the EMA. In the United States, we filed supplemental BLA submissions for first- and second-line mCRC with the FDA on October 29, 2010 and November 4, 2010. Both the EMA and FDA filings included the data from the 203 and 181 clinical trials. In addition, the FDA has indicated that in order for Vectibix  to be approved for these indications, there must be a commercially available, FDA-approved KRAS test kit. We continue to work with our partner QIAGEN N.V. to support their submission of a Premarket Application for approval of this test kit. On February 8, 2011, we and four other sponsor companies met with the FDA and the ODAC to discuss the status of our respective PMCs for product indications that had been granted accelerated approval by the FDA prior to 2009, including Vectibix  . At that meeting, we updated the Committee on the completion and submission of the main PMC for Vectibix  , the confirmatory 181 study, and participated in an open discussion with the ODAC on the accelerated approval process. Worldwide Vectibix  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $288 million, $233 million and $153 million, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for panitumumab are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration  U.S. Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr 4/8/2020 U.S. Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr 5/5/2017 Europe Fully human antibodies that bind EGFr 12/3/2017 Europe (1) Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr 5/5/2018 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens negatively impact Vectibix  sales.

Nplate  works by raising and sustaining platelet counts. We were granted an exclusive license by KA to manufacture and market Nplate  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In February 2009, we announced that the EC had granted marketing authorization for Nplate  for the treatment of splenectomized adult chronic ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments (eg, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). In the EU, Nplate  may also be considered as second-line treatment for adult non-splenectomized ITP patients where surgery is contraindicated. We currently have an approved REMS for Nplate  , which includes a medication guide, a healthcare provider communication plan and certain elements to assure safe use (including restricted distribution, registry, healthcare provider, institution and patient enrollment). As required, we have submitted REMS assessment reports to the FDA and are working with the FDA to determine any additional modifications to the REMS that will be needed. Worldwide Nplate  sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $229 million, $110 million and $17 million, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for romiplostim are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration  U.S. Thrombopoietic compounds 1/19/2022 Europe (1) Thrombopoietic compounds 10/22/2019 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating thrombocytopenia in splenectomized and non-splenectomized adults with chronic ITP negatively impact Nplate  sales.

We have a collaboration agreement with Glaxo Group Limited (Glaxo), a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK, for the commercialization of denosumab in certain countries. (See Business Relationships  Glaxo Group Limited.) Prolia  On June 1, 2010, the FDA approved Prolia  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. We estimate that the majority of potential U.S. Prolia  patients are covered under Medicare and the remaining patients under commercial plans. (See Reimbursement . ) Future U.S. product sales for Prolia  will depend on the willingness of primary care physicians to prescribe, the availability of reimbursement for and patient acceptance of the product. On May 25, 2010, the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. The timing of reimbursement authority approval of pricing in individual EU countries will vary by country, which could follow the EC approval by many months. For example, on July 1, 2010, Prolia  received reimbursement authority in Germany. On October 27, 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom (UK) recommended Prolia  for National Health Service (NHS) reimbursement as a treatment option for certain postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of primary and secondary osteoporotic fractures if other treatments available on the publicly-funded NHS are unsuitable. Worldwide Prolia  sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $33 million. The following table and discussion reflect other companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Prolia  .

Following the patent expiry, generic alendronate, which competes with FOSAMAX  and Prolia  , became available. ##TABLE_END Over the next several years, we expect certain additional marketed products noted above to lose patent protection, at which time we expect that generic versions of these products would become commercially available and compete with Prolia  . In addition to competition from the above-noted marketed products, Merck has a new cathepsin-K inhibitor, odanacatib, in phase 3 clinical trials that could compete with Prolia  in the future. XGEVA tm On November 18, 2010, the FDA approved XGEVA tm for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. XGEVA tm is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We also submitted a marketing authorization application to the EMA on June 4, 2010 for denosumab for the reduction of SREs in cancer patients. On December 12, 2010, we announced top-line results from a phase 3 trial evaluating XGEVA tm versus placebo in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The trial, known as the 147 study, demonstrated that XGEVA tm significantly improved median bone metastasis-free survival by 4.2 months compared to placebo (primary endpoint) and significantly improved time to first occurrence of bone metastases (secondary endpoint). Overall survival was similar between the XGEVA tm and placebo groups (secondary endpoint). This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for the prevention of bone metastasis in prostate cancer. (See Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.) U.S. XGEVA tm sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $8 million. The following table reflects currently marketed products that compete with XGEVA tm .

(2) Novartiss patent covering the use of Aredia  to treat tumor-induced hypercalcemia, osteolysis from multiple myeloma and bone metastases from breast cancer expired in the United States in 2001. Following the patent expiry, generic pamidronate, which competes with Aredia  and XGEVA tm , became available from other companies. ##TABLE_END Our outstanding material patents for denosumab are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START      Territory General Subject Matter Expiration (1)  U.S. RANKL antibodies; methods of interfering with RANK signaling 12/22/2017 U.S. Methods of treatment 11/11/2018 U.S. RANKL antibodies including sequences 11/28/2023 Europe RANKL antibodies 12/22/2017 Europe Medical use of RANKL antibodies 4/15/2018 Europe RANKL antibodies including epitope binding 2/23/2021 Europe RANKL antibodies including sequences 6/25/2022 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The expiration dates may be subject to change if delays in regulatory approval lead to extensions of patent terms in the United States and/or supplemental protection in Europe. ##TABLE_END Marketing and Distribution We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada to support our currently marketed products. We have also entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization and marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships.) Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, and also through the Internet. In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat, as well as providing support to various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas. (See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion for a discussion of the government regulation over product marketing and promotion.) In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. We utilize those wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. In Europe, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. We had product sales to three large wholesaler customers each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for 71% and 88% for 2010 of worldwide gross revenues and U.S. gross product sales, respectively, as noted in the table below. Certain information with respect to these distributors for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START              2010 2009 2008  AmerisourceBergen Corporation: Gross product sales $ 7,678 $ 7,179 $ 7,099 % of total gross revenues 38% 37% 37% % of U.S. gross product sales 47% 46% 46% McKesson Corporation: Gross product sales $ 3,913 $ 3,694 $ 3,594 % of total gross revenues 19% 19% 19% % of U.S. gross product sales 24% 24% 23% Cardinal Health, Inc.: Gross product sales $ 2,813 $ 2,841 $ 2,823 % of total gross revenues 14% 15% 15% % of U.S. gross product sales 17% 18% 18% ##TABLE_END Reimbursement Sales of all of our principal products are dependent in large part on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. Most patients receiving our products are covered by government healthcare programs or private insurers. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may adopt or be influenced by government coverage and reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. An increasing worldwide focus on patient access controls and cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our products. In addition, recent healthcare reform efforts enacted in the United States have made substantial long-term changes to the reimbursement of our products, and those changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business. U.S. Reimbursement System Our principal products are sold primarily in the United States and healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals and other healthcare professionals and providers, are reimbursed for their services by the government through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers. Government healthcare programs are funded primarily through the payment of taxes by individuals and businesses. The public and private components of this multi-payer system are described below. Medicare and Other Forms of Public Health Insurance Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities and end stage renal disease (ESRD), regardless of their age. The primary Medicare programs that affect reimbursement for our products are Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and outpatient care, and Medicare Part D, which provides a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare (as well as Medicaid, described below) and, among its responsibilities, has authority to issue Medicare NCDs which are national policy statements granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage for specific medical items or services. In addition, CMS has authority to issue manual policy issuances and updates as well as reimbursement codes for drugs and other items, which determine how products and services are reimbursed. Medicare Administrative Contractors have authority to issue local coverage determinations. CMS sometimes uses advisory committees of external experts in order to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. For example, the MEDCAC was established to provide independent guidance and expert advice to CMS on specific clinical topics. The MEDCAC reviews and evaluates medical literature, technology assessments, and examines data and information on the effectiveness and appropriateness of medical items and services that are covered under Medicare, or that may be eligible for coverage under Medicare. Medicare Part B Coverage of Drugs and ESRD. Medicare Part B provides limited coverage of outpatient drugs and biologicals that are furnished incident to a physicians services. Generally, incident to drugs and biologicals are covered if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that are not usually self-administered by the patient and are reasonable and necessary for a medically accepted diagnosis or treatment. Medicare Part B also covers certain drugs pursuant to a specific statutory directive, such as blood-clotting factors and certain immunosuppressive drugs, erythropoietin and certain oral cancer drugs, if they fall under a specific statutory benefit category and they are safe and effective as established by FDA approval. Many of our principal products are currently covered under Medicare Part B (as well as other government healthcare programs). In addition, most patients with ESRD, regardless of age, are eligible for coverage of dialysis treatment through the ESRD Program under Medicare Part B, the primary payer for dialysis treatment. Because Medicare Part B is the primary payer for dialysis treatment, reimbursement for products, such as EPOGEN  , that are typically administered in dialysis centers and other settings is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement policy. Beginning January 1, 2011, dialysis treatment is reimbursed by Medicare under a bundled payment system described in more detail below. (See Dialysis Reimbursement.) Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit for Medicare eligible beneficiaries. The coverage is available through various private plans that provide insurance coverage for prescription drugs for a monthly premium. The list of prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D plans varies by plan, but drug lists maintained by individual plans must cover certain classes of drugs and biologicals; specifically the statute stipulates that Medicare Part D plans have at least two drugs in each unique therapeutic category or class, subject to certain exceptions. Medicare patients who obtain ENBREL and Sensipar  under retail coverage, where they are primarily provided, are typically covered by Medicare Part D. Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by individual states for low-income and disabled eligible beneficiaries. CMS also has responsibility for federal administration of the Medicaid program. Under federal law, states must cover low-income adults and children, pregnant women, disabled individuals and seniors, and states have the option of expanding eligibility beyond those groups of beneficiaries. Medicaid is financed jointly by the states and federal government through taxes. Medicaid offers a broad set of benefits, including prescription drugs. Medicaid includes the Drug Rebate Program which requires manufacturers to provide rebates to the states for products covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Private Health Insurance Employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance currently represents the main pathway by which Americans receive private health insurance. Many employers provide health insurance as part of employees benefit packages. Insurance plans are administered by private companies, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and some companies are self-insured (i.e., they pay for all healthcare costs incurred by employees directly through a plan administered by a third party). Generally, employer-sponsored insurance premiums are paid primarily by employers and secondarily by employees. Individual market. The individual market covers part of the population that is self-employed or retired. In addition, it covers some people who are unable to obtain insurance through their employers. The plans are administered by private insurance companies. Individuals pay out-of-pocket insurance premiums for coverage, and the benefits vary widely according to plan specifications. Reimbursement of Our Principal Products Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . Medicare and Medicaid payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. The Medicare program covers our principal products Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  (as well as certain of our other products including Vectibix  , Nplate  , Prolia  and XGEVA tm ) under Part B, when administered in the physician clinic setting and the hospital outpatient and dialysis settings. Healthcare providers are reimbursed for these products under a buy and bill process where providers purchase the product in advance of treatment and then submit a reimbursement claim to Medicare following administration of the product. Medicare reimburses providers using a payment methodology based on a fixed percentage of each products average sales price (ASP). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current Period) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect so healthcare providers will know the applicable reimbursement rates. In the calculation of ASP, CMS currently allows manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices and in the future CMS may provide more specific guidance. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, hospital outpatient setting and, to a lesser extent, the dialysis facility setting. (See EPOGEN  and Dialysis Reimbursement.) Our ASP calculations are reviewed quarterly for completeness and based on such review, we have on occasion restated our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. (See Items 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) Since 2005, in the physician office setting under Medicare Part B, Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  have been reimbursed at 106% of their ASP (sometimes referred to as ASP+6%), and in 2011 will continue to be reimbursed at this rate pursuant to the 2011 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule. In the hospital outpatient setting, from 2006 to 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates fell incrementally from ASP+6% to ASP+4%, but rose in 2011 to ASP+5% pursuant to the 2011 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment Final Rule. CMS has the regulatory authority to further adjust formulas in future years. The extent to which commercial payers adopt the use of ASP as a payment methodology is often based on the contractual relationship between the provider and the insurer. Dialysis Reimbursement. Currently, dialysis providers in the United States are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by Medicare through the ESRD Program, which is established by federal law and implemented by CMS. The ESRD Program reimburses Medicare providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including EPOGEN  and Aranesp  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers, at ASP+6%, using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMSs bundled payment system went into effect for dialysis facilities which provides a single payment for all dialysis services including drugs, supplies and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. Key provisions under the new system include: ##TABLE_START   Unit of payment  CMS will provide a per treatment unit of payment. Consistent with past policy, ESRD facilities can be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more frequent treatments.    Payment rate  for 2011, the base rate is $229.63 per treatment.    Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents  oral-only drugs, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will remain under the Medicare Part D benefit until 2014 when they will be reimbursed under the bundled payment system. ##TABLE_END 20 Dialysis providers were given the choice of opting into the new bundled payment system 100% on January 1, 2011, or phasing in over a four-year period. Substantially, all dialysis providers in the United States have opted into the bundled payment system in its entirety. To encourage dialysis facilities to continue to provide quality dialysis treatment under the new bundled payment system, on December 29, 2010, CMS issued the Final Rule to implement the ESRD Quality Improvement Program (QIP). Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, ESRD facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2% of amounts reimbursed for failure to meet or exceed CMS quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy. Under the QIP, the penalty will be based on a composite score of measures as follows: ##TABLE_START   The percent of Medicare patients with Hb levels below 10 g/dL constitutes 50% of the weighting.    The percent of Medicare patients with Hb levels above 12 g/dL represents 25% of the weighting.    The percent of Medicare patients with an average Urea Reduction Ratio of greater than or equal to 65% constitutes 25% of the weighting. ##TABLE_END Notwithstanding the implementation of the QIP in 2012, we expect the bundled payment system to decrease dose utilization of EPOGEN  and that this decrease will have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN  sales. Further, if CMS issues an NCD for the use of ESAs in patients who have kidney disease (see Other ESA Reimbursement Developments below), CMS could further adjust the bundled payment system and/or the QIP. Other ESA Reimbursement Developments. Since April 1, 2006, Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has been subject to a Erythropoietin Monitoring Policy (EMP), the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN  and Aranesp  utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The EMP was revised, effective January 1, 2008, requiring a 50% reduction in Medicare reimbursement if a patients Hb is above 13 g/dL for three or more consecutive months. In addition, the revised EMP reduces the monthly dosing limits to 400,000 international units (IUs) of EPOGEN  , from 500,000 IUs, and to 1,200 micrograms (mcgs) of Aranesp  , from 1,500 mcgs. On March 14, 2007, CMS announced a review of all Medicare policies related to the administration of ESAs in non-renal disease applications as part of an NCA, which is generally CMS first step toward developing an NCD. As a result of that review, CMS initiated an NCD for non-renal ESAs. After various CMS proposals and a public comment period, CMS issued a final NCD on July 30, 2007. The 2007 NCD determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. We believe the restrictions in the 2007 NCD changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy. We believe this restriction on coverage of ESAs in the 2007 NCD has had a material adverse effect on the coverage, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , and our business and results of operations. In addition, many private payers have implemented portions of the 2007 NCD and we believe many healthcare providers have reduced ESA utilization for all of their patients regardless of insurance coverage. On March 24, 2010, CMS held a MEDCAC meeting to examine the currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD. Although there was no clear outcome from the MEDCAC meeting, on June 16, 2010, CMS opened a new NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia, which is generally CMS first step toward developing an NCD. CMS has stated that the NCA process for ESAs will conclude on or before June 16, 2011, but CMS could propose a new NCD at any time prior to that deadline. Additionally, on January 19, 2011, CMS held another MEDCAC meeting, this time to review the available evidence on the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival. ENBREL Reimbursement. The majority of prescription claims for ENBREL are paid through private insurance companies. Under Medicare, ENBREL is reimbursed through the Part D program, although less than 10% of all ENBREL U.S. prescriptions are reimbursed by Medicare. Prolia  Reimbursement We estimate that the majority of potential U.S. Prolia  patients are covered under Medicare and the remaining under commercial plans. Beginning in 2010, Prolia  has been reimbursed under Medicare Part B through the buy and bill process. (See Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  .) The buy and bill reimbursement process for Prolia  has required, and is expected to continue to require, time to become established, particularly among primary care physicians who may have limited experience using this reimbursement process. We expect that U.S. Medicare Part D plans will begin to cover Prolia  in 2011 and that commercial coverage will continue to expand as more commercial plans make their decisions about Prolia  coverage and reimbursement. Medicaid Reimbursement Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program established in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments of that law. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate to the states for each unit of our product reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. As more fully described below, the new healthcare reform law enacted in the United States in March 2010 made certain changes in how those rebates are calculated and to whom they must be extended. (See U.S. Healthcare Reform . ) The amount of the rebate for each of our products is currently set by law as a minimum of 23.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any non-government customer. The rebate amount is determined for each quarter based on our reports to CMS of the quarters AMP and best price for each of our products. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. As described below, the statutory definition of AMP changed in 2010 as a result of the new U.S. healthcare reform law, and we expect CMS to shortly issue a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is issued, we will be required to make reasonable assumptions when calculating AMP. Once CMS proposed rule is issued, and clarification is provided on the calculation of AMP, we will have to determine whether our reasonable assumptions need to be amended to comply with the regulations definition of AMP, and whether we need to restate our prior AMPs. The terms of our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. Related to our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program is a requirement that we extend comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) drug pricing program to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As more fully described below, the list of entities to which we are required to extend these discounts also expanded as a result of the new healthcare reform law. We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHC Act), federal law has required that we offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of our products under the Medicaid program or purchase of our products by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. The accuracy of our reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs and our FSS contract prices may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws and the terms of our FSS contract. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies in calculation of Non-FAMPs and FCPs is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified Federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. Also, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false Non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. Finally, we are required to disclose in our FSS contract proposal all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than our proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, we are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. U.S. Healthcare Reform. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA) and the companion Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to the PPACA, primarily with respect to the PPACAs financial and budgetary impacts, were signed into law. We refer to those two laws collectively as the new healthcare reform law. The new healthcare reform law imposes additional costs on and reduces the revenue of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The following paragraphs describe certain provisions of the new healthcare reform law that will affect the reimbursement of our products. The new healthcare reform law increased the rebates we pay to the states for our products that are covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. The healthcare reform law increased the minimum base Medicaid rebate rate payable on our products reimbursed by Medicaid from 15.1% to 23.1% of the AMP of the product, or if it is greater, the difference between the AMP and the best price available from us to any non-government customer. The change in the minimum rebate percentage was effective on January 1, 2010. The healthcare reform law also extended the Medicaid drug rebate program to patients in Medicaid managed care insurance plans for whom rebates were not previously required. The extension of rebates to patients in Medicaid managed care plans was effective on March 23, 2010. As mentioned above, the new healthcare reform law also expanded the list of provider institutions to which we must extend discounts under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. The new healthcare reform law added certain cancer centers, childrens hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers to the list of entities to which these discounts must be extended. This change to the list of eligible entities was effective on January 1, 2010. The healthcare reform law also imposed a new fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, which includes drugs approved under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or biologicals licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act. Beginning in 2011, the new healthcare reform law sets an aggregate annual fee, to be paid by these manufacturers and importers, totaling $28 billion over 10 years, of which $2.5 billion is payable in 2011. This annual fee will be apportioned among the participating companies, including us, based on each companys sales of qualifying products to, and utilization by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The additional fee became effective January 1, 2011, and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Manufacturers and importers of generic or biosimilar drugs are not subject to the fee. We estimate that we will be required to pay $150 million to $200 million as our portion of the 2011 fee. Since the Medicare Part D drug benefit took effect in 2006, beneficiaries enrolled in Part D plans have been required to pay 100% of their prescription drug costs after their total drug spending exceeds an initial coverage limit until they qualify for catastrophic coverage. This coverage gap is sometimes referred to as the Part D doughnut hole. The new healthcare reform law reduces the doughnut hole by requiring manufacturers like us to provide a 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients whose prescription expenses exceed the Part D prescription drug coverage limit but have not yet reached the catastrophic coverage threshold. This provision became effective January 1, 2011. The new healthcare reform law also expands the Medicaid eligibility to include those with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), from 100% of the FPL. This provision becomes effective January 1, 2014. We estimate that the total impact of U.S. healthcare reform in 2011 to us, including the industry fee described above, will be in the range of $400 million to $500 million. Reimbursement Outside the United States Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems have traditionally been the primary payers of all healthcare costs, including payment for drugs and biologicals. Over the past several years, the reimbursement environment in Europe has become very challenging, with the advent of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations (eg, NICE in the UK) that make recommendations and/or determinations of coverage and reimbursement based on both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product. Although the methods employed by different HTA agencies vary from country to country, the use of formal economic metrics has been increasing across Europe as well as in several emerging markets throughout the world. In addition to determining whether or not a new product will be reimbursed, these agencies are becoming increasingly involved in setting the maximum price at which the product will be reimbursed  the value-based price for a product. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. In some countries, international price referencing is the primary mechanism for price control whereby the ceiling price of a pharmaceutical or biological product is set based on the prices in particular benchmark countries. These price referencing rules are increasing in complexity as prices become more transparent and payers seek lower-price benchmarks against which to compare themselves. Additional cost-containment measures can include therapeutic reference pricing (eg, setting the reimbursement rate for a given class of agents at the lowest price within the class), generic substitution and government-mandated price cuts. While mandatory price reductions have been a recurring aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the EU, given the current worldwide economic conditions, some EU governmental agencies have increased the frequency and/or size of such mandatory price reductions to extract further cost savings. For example, in 2010, countries such as Greece announced price reductions and/or mandated rebates for certain pharmaceutical and biological products that substantially exceeded prior levels. Other countries may follow and/or take similar or more extensive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics, including implementing mandatory price reductions, establishing preferences for biosimilar products, or reducing the amount of reimbursement. In many countries, the influence of regional and hospital payers also contributes to whether patients have access to certain products. For example, a product may be successfully listed on a national formulary, but may also be subject to further evaluations or competitive bidding by payers at a regional or hospital level. Finally, payers in some countries are beginning to experiment with alternative payment mechanisms (eg, payment caps) as a means to maintain access to innovative therapies. Fraud and Abuse Regulations Related to Reimbursement As participants in government reimbursement programs, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. (See Government Regulation  Other.) Violations of fraud and abuse laws can result in stringent enforcement penalties up to and including complete exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and cell culture, which are the processes by which our proteins are produced. The proteins are purified to a high quality and then formulated into a stable form. The fill process dispenses the formulated bulk protein into vials or syringes. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution. We operate commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) Manufacturing of Sensipar  /Mimpara  , our small molecule product, is currently performed by third-party contract manufacturers, although we are in the process of transferring certain finishing aspects to our facility in Puerto Rico. We also use and expect to continue to use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of certain of our large molecule marketed products, including ENBREL, Nplate  , Prolia  and XGEVA tm as well as a number of our clinical product candidates. In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, we also supply Epoetin alfa in the United States to JJ under a supply agreement. (See Business Relationships  Johnson  Johnson.) The global supply of our principal products depends on actively managing the inventory produced at our facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers and the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers. During the manufacturing scale-up process, and even after achieving sustainable commercial manufacturing, we may encounter difficulties or disruptions due to defects in raw materials or equipment, contamination or other factors that could impact product availability. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales and  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.) We have obtained from various parties certain licenses we deem necessary or desirable for the manufacture of our products. The licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the licensors based on product sales. Commercial Bulk Manufacturing We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in several locations throughout the United States. (See Item 2. Properties.) We perform all of the commercial bulk manufacturing of all of our proteins except ENBREL, Prolia  and XGEVA tm , which we supplement with a third-party contract manufacturer. Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish Manufacturing Our primary commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility is located in Puerto Rico. We perform the commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing for our proteins at that facility, except for Vectibix  and Nplate  . We operate a commercial formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facility in the United States for Vectibix  and the formulation, fill and finish for Nplate  is performed by a third-party contract manufacturer. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico, fill and finish of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by third-party contract manufacturers. We also conduct certain finish activities in the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) Clinical Manufacturing Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California location. (See Item 2. Properties.) Certain finishing activities for our clinical products are performed in the Netherlands. In addition, we also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain of our clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United States, principally in Kentucky and California, and in the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. In addition, we also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our commercial and clinical products in certain areas of the world. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands perform key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, distribution and production scheduling. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. (See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . ) Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to optimize our manufacturing network and mitigate risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our commercial products. For example, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site in order to mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility and we are qualifying the expansion of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site in order to maintain supply and to satisfy anticipated future demand for denosumab. Upon completion, the facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. We have also entered into an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) for the divestiture of our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California to further optimize our manufacturing network. In addition to these projects, we have initiatives designed to operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, further optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials necessary for the commercial and clinical bulk manufacturing of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only source for such materials. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be the sole source. Certain of the raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from the specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these items. Certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin (HSA). Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.) We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships including, joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. In addition, we also acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third-parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for non-refundable upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration agreements are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require parties to business relationships to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information. Kirin Holdings Company, Limited We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirins product rights, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East, (ii) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States and (iv) romiplostim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We currently market darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: (i) darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, G-CSF and romiplostim in Japan, the Peoples Republic of China (China), Taiwan, Korea and certain other countries in Asia, and (ii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan and China. Kirin markets darbepoetin alfa in Japan under the brand name NESP  . Kirin markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under separate agreements with KA. Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN  /Grasin  /Filgrastim  . Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO  . Kirin also markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China under a separate agreement with Amgen Greater China Ltd., a subsidiary of Amgen Inc. KA has licensed to JJ rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan. (See Johnson  Johnson.) Under its agreement with KA, JJ pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world. In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payment from KA for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. (See Note 7, Related party transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Johnson  Johnson We granted JJ a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all indications other than dialysis and diagnostics. All recombinant human erythropoietin sold by JJ in the United States is manufactured by us and sold by JJ under the trademark PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT  brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN  brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. market for the dialysis indication. Pursuant to the license agreement with JJ, we earn a 10% royalty on net sales of PROCRIT  by JJ in the United States. Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, JJ was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, JJ manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold by a subsidiary of JJ under various trademarks such as EPREX  and ERYPO  . We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by JJ outside of the United States. Pfizer Inc. Amgen and Pfizer are in a collaboration agreement to co-promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. Under the agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Amgen and Pfizer is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL, including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which requires a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the collaboration agreement, Amgen and Pfizer share in the agreed-upon selling and marketing expenses approved by the joint management committee. We currently pay Pfizer a percentage of the annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. After expiration of the collaboration agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are required to pay Pfizer a percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years. The annual amount of such payments is anticipated to be significantly less than the current ENBREL profit share. Glaxo Group Limited In July 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Glaxo for the commercialization of denosumab for osteoporosis indications in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (the Primary Territories). We retained the rights to commercialize denosumab for all indications in the United States and Canada and for oncology indications in the Primary Territories. Under a related agreement, Glaxo will commercialize denosumab for all indications in countries, excluding Japan, where we do not currently have a commercial presence, including China, Brazil, India, Taiwan and South Korea (the Expansion Territories). In the Expansion Territories, Glaxo will be responsible for all development and commercialization costs and will purchase denosumab from us to meet demand. We have the option of expanding our role in the future in the commercialization of denosumab in the Primary Territories and certain of the Expansion Territories. In the Primary Territories, we share equally in the commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses, including an amount payable to us in recognition of our discovery and development of denosumab. Glaxo will also be responsible for bearing a portion of the cost of certain specified development activities in the Primary Territories. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited In February 2008, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda, which provides Takeda the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 12 clinical stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. The products include Vectibix  which received regulatory approval in Japan in 2010 for unresectable, advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS , AMG 386, which is in a phase 3 trial in the United States for recurrent ovarian cancer, and ganitumab (AMG 479) which is expected to enter into a phase 3 trial in the United States for first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in 2011. We have the right to participate in the promotion of the products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidate motesanib in the oncology area. Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib in the other partys territory. Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited In July 2007, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, which provides Daiichi Sankyo the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize denosumab in Japan in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), oncology and certain other indications. As part of the agreement, Amgen received exclusive worldwide rights to certain Daiichi Sankyo intellectual property to the extent applicable to denosumab. Fresenius Medical Care North America In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius Medical Care North America (Fresenius North America) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care), on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby Fresenius North America agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius North Americas commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development. We must conduct extensive clinical trials designed to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates in order to file for regulatory approval to market a product. Product development and approval within that regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval we obtain remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions. In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing is substantial and may vary by product. For example, the clinical trials for the BLA for Prolia  /XGEVA tm were large and required substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. Foreign studies performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to good clinical practice. Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may not be able to develop commercial products.) The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Applications. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products subject to the Public Health Service Act or a new drug application (NDA) for drugs subject to the approval provisions of the FDCA. The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDAs review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Post-approval Phase. After we have obtained approval to market our products, we monitor adverse events from the use of our products and report such events to regulatory agencies, along with information from post marketing surveillance or studies. We may utilize other research approaches to learn or confirm information about our marketed products, including observational studies and patient registries, and may engage in risk management activities such as physician education initiatives and patient advocacy group initiatives. We may also conduct, or be required by regulatory agencies to conduct, further clinical trials to provide additional information on our marketed products safety and efficacy. Those additional trials may include studying different doses or schedules of administration that were used in previous studies, use in other patient populations or other stages of the disease or use over a longer period of time. Additional trials of this nature are sometimes required by regulatory agencies as a condition of their approval to market our products and they might also request or require that we conduct specific studies, including observational epidemiological studies, in order to identify or assess possible safety risks of our marketed products that are observed or suggested by available scientific data and such trials are sometimes referred to as PMCs or PMRs. In the United States, under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA), if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, it may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk. If we are required to conduct such a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which our products have already been approved and to the reimbursement provided by government and commercial payers for our products. The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require companies to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. While risk management activities and programs are not new, with FDAAA the FDA gained new authority to implement specific risk management requirements and new enforcement power to ensure that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA began to implement REMS in 2008. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. In determining whether a product will require a REMS before the product is approved, the FDA may consider a number of factors including: ##TABLE_START   estimated size of the population likely to use the product;    seriousness of the condition treated and expected benefits of the product;    duration of treatment with the product;    seriousness of known or potential adverse events associated with the product; and    whether the product is a new molecular entity. ##TABLE_END 30 All REMS are required to have a timetable for assessment and may have one or more of the following: ##TABLE_START   distribution of a medication guide or a patient package insert to patients;    communication plan for the healthcare provider or institution, such as a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter;    elements to assure safe use including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    specific training, experience or certification for prescribers;     certification of medication dispensing sites and dispensing in limited settings;     monitoring of specific patients; and     enrollment of patients in a registry. ##TABLE_END Each REMS is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. Failure to comply with a REMS, including submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, ENBREL, Prolia  and Nplate  . Because REMS are relatively new, the FDA and sponsor companies continue to learn how best to implement, operate and monitor the effectiveness of REMS, and the requirements of our REMS and those of other companies may change over time. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Also under the FDAs PLR implemented in 2006, we are required to make changes to the existing format of U.S. product package inserts for human prescription drug and biological products with the intent of making product information more easily accessible. The PLR requires revised standards of content and format of labeling and provides timelines for when new and previously approved products must comply with the new regulations. During the PLR conversion process from an old format to the new PLR format, the FDA has the authority to evaluate the package insert information to ensure that it accurately reflects current knowledge and the FDA may revise, add or remove information in the old format that could substantively impact the content of the product package insert for the new format. Failure to implement FDA-mandated changes may result in civil or criminal penalties. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities and  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) The package inserts for our ENBREL and Neulasta  products have already been converted to the new PLR format and we are currently working with the FDA on converting the package inserts for Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Sensipar  . Our Vectibix  , Nplate  , Prolia  and XGEVA tm products were approved in the PLR format. The FDA also uses various advisory committees of external experts to assist in its mission to protect and promote the public health, to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. The committees are generally advisory only and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by their recommendations. We have participated in meetings of the ODAC, the CRDAC and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs, among others, to address certain issues related to our products, including Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Prolia  . FDA Approval of Biosimilar Products. The new healthcare reform law authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a separate, abbreviated pathway. The new law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The new law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. While the FDA now has the authority to approve biosimilar products, the FDA has not announced whether it will first publish guidance or rules for biosimilar applicants before approving biosimilar products. The FDA held a public meeting in November 2010 to seek stakeholder input on the subject and accepted written comments through 2010. FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of products. We are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing or promoting a product as a treatment for a particular indication. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (off-label promotion) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including suspension of our manufacturing operations. Such issues may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review. Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the United States. In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the EMA who conducts a thorough evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. In the EU, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be similar. In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of innovators. After evaluation and marketing authorization, various parties, including the national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holders share responsibilities for the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems in a process known as pharmacovigilance. Healthcare professionals and patients are also encouraged to report adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. This process includes the collection of adverse drug reaction reports as part of the follow-up on any side effects of a product, and upon assessment, the authorities can decide to demand that product labels be updated with safety data or warnings, that safety data or warnings be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market. Other. We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government and the states have published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors wherever possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities related to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating those laws or if we entered into a settlement with the government, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of those laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates Our vision is to deliver therapeutics that can make a meaningful difference in patients lives. Therefore, we focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neurology. We take a modality-independent approach to RD  that is, we identify targets, and then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. As such, our discovery research programs may yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) or small molecules. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers in Canada and Germany, and smaller development facilities throughout Europe and in Canada, Australia, Mexico, Hong Kong and India. (See Item 2. Properties.) To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to maintain an effective development organization and associated RD support organizations. We conduct clinical trial activities with both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. In order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These licenses and collaboration agreements generally provide for non-refundable upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Various public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of RD in the biotechnology industry. We face competition in pursuing collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms. See Government Regulation  Clinical Development for a discussion of the government regulation over clinical development. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 9, 2011, unless otherwise indicated. Each target indication for product candidates in phase 3 is listed separately. Additional product candidate (pipeline) information can be found on our website at http://www.amgen.com.

AMG 386 AMG 386 is a peptibody that inhibits the interaction between the endothelial cell-selective Tie2 receptor and its ligands Ang1 and Ang2. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2007 and 2008, we initiated five randomized phase 2 studies of AMG 386 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, and numerous other supportive studies. In June 2010 at a medical meeting, we presented the results from the phase 2 recurrent ovarian cancer trial. Based on study results, we initiated a phase 3 study in recurrent ovarian cancer in 2010. We also initiated a phase 1b study in first-line ovarian cancer in 2010. We are initiating other phase 2 studies in 2011. Ganitumab (AMG 479) Ganitumab (AMG 479) is a fully human monoclonal antibody antagonist of IGF-1 receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2007, we initiated a phase 2 study of ganitumab (AMG 479) as a potential cancer therapeutic in Ewings sarcoma. We also initiated, in 2008, phase 2 studies for the treatment of advanced breast, pancreatic, colorectal and small cell lung cancers. We reported the results from the phase 2 Ewings sarcoma and pancreatic cancer studies at a medical meeting in June 2010 and results from the breast cancer study at a meeting in December 2010. Results from a study in mCRC in combination with Vectibix  were reported at a meeting in January 2011. We are initiating a phase 3 study in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in 2011. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  is a recombinant human protein agonist of the erythropoietin receptor. The Reduction of Events with Darbepoetin alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF  ) Trial phase 3 study, initiated in 2006, is a large (2,600 subjects planned), global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure. The RED-HF  Trial continues to enroll subjects and we anticipate completion of the study in 2012. Motesanib Motesanib is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors and stem cell factor receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this product in collaboration with Takeda/Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Enrollment in the phase 3 first-line NSCLC study (MONET1) evaluating motesanib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC is complete. Based on current event rates, we anticipate completion of the study in the first half of 2011. At a medical meeting in June 2010, we shared the results of biomarkers as predictors of response to treatment with motesanib or bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with NSCLC or in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Denosumab Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, RA and numerous tumor types across the spectrum of cancer-related bone diseases. Prolia  (denosumab) The phase 3 study evaluating Prolia  patients with male osteoporosis is ongoing. XGEVA tm (denosumab) In February 2010, we announced that a pivotal, phase 3, head-to-head study evaluating XGEVA tm versus Zometa  (zoledronic acid) in the treatment of bone metastases in 1,901 men with advanced prostate cancer met its primary and secondary endpoints. XGEVA tm demonstrated superiority over Zometa  for both delaying the time to the first on-study SRE (fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71, 0.95), and reducing the rate of multiple SREs (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). Both results were statistically significant. In December 2010, we announced top-line results from a phase 3 trial evaluating XGEVA tm versus placebo in 1,432 men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The trial, known as the 147 study, demonstrated that XGEVA tm significantly improved median bone metastasis-free survival by 4.2 months (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.98, p=0.03) compared to placebo (primary endpoint), and significantly improved time to first occurrence of bone metastases (secondary endpoint). Overall survival was similar between the XGEVA tm and placebo groups (secondary endpoint). Overall rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were generally similar between XGEVA tm and placebo, with hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) observed at increased frequencies in the XGEVA tm arm. The yearly rate of ONJ in the XGEVA tm -treated group was similar to what has been observed in prior XGEVA tm trials. This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for a new indication for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer. Also, we are currently conducting a study for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer and are planning an additional SRE study in patients with multiple myeloma. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  /Mimpara  is an orally-administered small molecule that lowers PTH levels in blood by signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid tissue to inhibit PTH secretion. It also lowers blood calcium and phosphorous levels. The phase 3 EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (E.V.O.L.V.E tm ) trial, initiated in 2006, is a large (3,800 patient), multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects of Sensipar  /Mimpara  in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. The E.V.O.L.V.E tm study completed enrollment in January 2008. Based on current event rates, we anticipate completion of the study in dialysis patients in 2012. Sensipar  /Mimpara  is also being evaluated in post renal transplant patients. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is a monoclonal antibody antagonist of the EGFr pathway. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. On April 16, 2010, our application for marketing authorization for the use of Vectibix  in first- and second-line treatment of mCRC in patients whose tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes was submitted to the EMA. In the United States, we filed supplemental BLA submissions for first- and second-line mCRC with the FDA on October 29, and November 4, 2010. In August 2010, we announced top-line results from a randomized phase 3 trial evaluating Vectibix  as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer. The data showed the addition of Vectibix  to platinum-based chemotherapy did not result in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, the primary endpoint, compared to chemotherapy alone [median 11.1 months versus 9.0 months, HR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.05)]. Secondary endpoints of progression-free survival [median 5.8 months versus 4.6 months, HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.92)] and objective response rate (36% versus 25%) were numerically improved but were not tested for statistical significance. Additionally, we have two ongoing phase 2 trials in locally advanced head and neck cancer. AMG 785 AMG 785 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets sclerostin, a protein secreted by bone cells that inhibits bone formation. AMG 785 (also known as CDP7851) is being developed in collaboration with UCB for bone-related conditions, including PMO and fracture healing. In 2009, we initiated phase 2 studies of AMG 785 for the treatment of PMO and fracture healing (tibial diaphyseal). In 2010, we initiated a phase 2 study of AMG 785 for the treatment of fracture healing (hip). AMG 827 AMG 827 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks signaling via the interleukin-17 receptor. It is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of inflammatory disorders. In 2009, we initiated phase 2 studies of AMG 827 as a potential treatment for psoriasis and RA. In 2010, we initiated phase 2 studies of AMG 827 as a potential treatment for Crohns disease and asthma. We received the results from the phase 2 study in psoriasis in 2010 and plan to share these data at an upcoming medical meeting. AMG 853 AMG 853 is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of the CRTH2 and D-prostanoid receptors of prostaglandin D2. It is being investigated as a treatment for asthma. Phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose studies have been completed. A global, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose phase 2 study in subjects with inadequately controlled asthma was initiated in December 2009 and is ongoing. Conatumumab Conatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody agonist that targets death receptor 5 and induces apoptosis in sensitive tumor cells. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We have an ongoing phase 2 study in mCRC. Nplate  (romiplostim) Nplate  is a peptibody agonist of the TPO receptor. In December 2010, we announced results at a medical meeting from studies evaluating Nplate  in adult and pediatric patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura. Results from completed phase 2 studies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were presented in 2010. In late February 2011, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that we modify the study conduct in another ongoing phase 2 study exploring the use of Nplate  in MDS, expressing concern that the demonstrated benefits seen in treated patients might not outweigh the potential risks of accelerated disease progression to AML. The DMC was also concerned that transient blast cell increases in the Nplate  arm put patients at risk for diagnosis of, and treatment for, AML, irrespective of whether or not the disease had actually developed. We accepted the recommendation of the DMC and notified investigators that subjects in this study should discontinue Nplate  treatment and enter into the observational long-term follow-up phase of the study. Nplate  is also being evaluated in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Omecamtiv mecarbil (AMG 423) Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small molecule activator of cardiac myosin. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being investigated to improve cardiac contractility in subjects with heart failure. We are developing this product in collaboration with Cytokinetics, Inc. (Cytokinetics). Rilotumumab (AMG 102) Rilotumumab (AMG 102) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. Results from a study in mCRC in combination with Vectibix  were reported at a meeting in January 2011. Phase 2 combination studies with rilotumumab (AMG 102) in the gastric, prostate, mCRC and small cell lung cancer settings continue. Human Resources As of December 31, 2010, Amgen had approximately 17,400 staff members, which includes approximately 300 part-time staff members. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants and scientific advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of employment or a consulting relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of all of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers may regulate prices, reimbursement levels and/or access to our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. We rely in large part on the reimbursement of our principal products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in foreign countries and a reduction in the coverage and/or reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. The government-sponsored healthcare systems in Europe and many other foreign countries are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including payment for drugs and biologics, in those regions. While mandatory price reductions have been a recurring aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in Europe, given the current worldwide economic conditions, certain European country governments have increased the frequency and size of such mandatory price reductions to extract further cost savings. For example, in 2010 countries such as Greece announced price reductions and/or mandated rebates for certain pharmaceutical and biological products that substantially exceeded prior levels. We expect that other countries may follow and/or take similar or more extensive actions to reduce expenditure on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, preference for biosimilar products or reduction in the amount of reimbursement. While we cannot fully predict the extent of further price reductions by countries in Europe or the impact such price reductions will have on our business, such reductions in price and/or the coverage and reimbursement for our products in European countries could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. In March 2010 the United States adopted significant healthcare reform through the enactment of the PPACA and the Heathcare and Education Reconciliation Act. (See Reimbursement  U.S. Healthcare Reform.) A major goal of the new healthcare reform law is to provide greater access to healthcare coverage for more Americans. Accordingly, the new healthcare reform law requires individual U.S. citizens and legal residents to maintain qualifying health coverage, imposes certain requirements on employers with respect to offering health coverage to employees, amends insurance regulations regarding when coverage can be provided and denied to individuals, and expands existing government healthcare coverage programs to more individuals in more situations, with most of these changes going into effect in January 2014. We do not expect a significant increase in sales of our products as a result of the 2014 expansions in healthcare coverage. The new healthcare reform law does have several components, with varied implementation dates that began in 2010, that have and are expected to continue to adversely impact our business. While we cannot fully predict the ultimate impact the new healthcare reform law will have on us, we expect that the new law will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Public and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement under Medicare Part B coverage. Any deterioration in the timeliness or certainty of payment from CMS to physicians, including as a result of changes in policy or regulations, or as a result of operational difficulties, could negatively impact the willingness of physicians to prescribe our products for patients relying on Medicare for their medical coverage. Most of our products furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in both a physician office setting and hospital outpatient setting are reimbursed under the ASP payment methodology. ASP-based reimbursements of products under Medicare may be below or could fall below the cost that some medical providers pay for such products, which would adversely affect sales of our products. We also face certain risks relating to the calculation of ASP. ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. However, the statute, regulations and CMS guidance do not define specific methodologies for all aspects of the calculation of ASP. For example, in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule for 2011, CMS did not address a proposed methodology for treatment of bundled price concessions. Consequently, the current CMS guidance is that manufacturers may make reasonable assumptions in their calculation of ASP consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute, federal regulations and their customary business practices. As a result, we are required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of calculating ASP which are disclosed to CMS and also are subject to further CMS review. If our calculation of ASP is incorrect, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Additionally, we are required to pay rebates to the federal government on products reimbursed by Medicaid at a rate of 23.1% of the average manufacturers price (AMP) of a product, or if it is greater, the difference between the AMP and the best price available to any non-government customer. The definition of AMP recently changed and we expect CMS to shortly issue a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is issued, we will be required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of the AMP calculation. Once the CMS rule is issued, we will have to determine whether our interpretation of AMP follows the rule or would need to be restated and this could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Other initiatives reviewing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement rates. For example, in July 2007, CMS issued an NCD where it determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. Generally, an NCD is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage or reimbursement for a specific medical item or service. We believe the restrictions in the 2007 NCD changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy in the oncology setting. As a result, we believe these restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , which has had a significant impact to our business. The reimbursement of ESAs in the nephrology setting is also receiving attention. On March 24, 2010, CMS held a MEDCAC meeting to examine the currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD and on June 16, 2010, CMS opened an NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. This NCA initiates the process of reviewing and evaluating potential changes in Medicare coverage policies for the use of ESAs in those patients and may result in the issuance of a new NCD by CMS. The 30-day public comment period on the NCA ended on July 17, 2010 and CMS has stated that the NCA process for ESAs will conclude on or before June 16, 2011, but CMS could propose a new NCD at any time prior to that deadline. Additionally, on January 19, 2011, CMS held another MEDCAC meeting, this time to review the available evidence on the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival. This development continues CMSs process of reviewing and evaluating potential changes in Medicare coverage policies for the use of ESAs in patients with CKD. We cannot predict if and when a new NCD will be issued or the details of any potentially changed coverage decisions for the use of ESAs in patients with CKD, including whether or how a new NCD could change CMSs bundled payment system and/or the ESRD QIP. However, similar to the impact of the 2007 NCD on the use of ESAs in oncology, a new NCD around the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia may negatively affect use, coverage and reimbursement, and/or product sales of our ESA products in the nephrology setting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, the list of potential future NCDs issued by CMS in late 2008 included the category of thrombopoiesis stimulating agents (platelet growth factors), the category of drugs that includes Nplate  , and a discussion on bisphosphonates used to treat osteoporosis. CMS has not announced whether it will proceed with an NCA related to thrombopoiesis stimulating agents and, while Prolia  is not a bisphosphonate, there is the possibility that CMS might evaluate other agents, including RANK Ligand inhibitors such as Prolia  and XGEVA tm . In the dialysis setting, the reimbursement rates for our products are also subject to downward pressure. In the United States, dialysis providers are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved dialysis providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs while the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance and, to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement methodology is established by federal law and is implemented by CMS. Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including EPOGEN  and Aranesp  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers at ASP+6%, using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMSs bundled payment system went into effect for dialysis facilities which provides a single payment for all dialysis services including drugs, supplies, and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. (See Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Dialysis Reimbursement.) Dialysis providers were given the choice of opting into the new bundled payment system in its entirety on January 1, 2011, or phasing in ratably over a four-year period beginning in 2011. Substantially all dialysis providers in the United States have opted into the bundled payment system in its entirety beginning in 2011. We expect that the implementation of the bundled payment system by ESRD facilities will have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN  beginning in 2011, and Sensipar  beginning in 2014. Additional initiatives addressing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement, which could negatively affect sales of our products. For example, since April 2006, the Medicare reimbursement for ESAs administered to dialysis patients has also been subject to an EMP, the Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to monitor EPOGEN  and Aranesp  utilization and hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. CMS revised the EMP, effective January 2008, further limiting reimbursement for EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in certain cases. Further reduction in reimbursement in the dialysis setting could have a material adverse effect on sales of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  , and our business. If, for any of these or other reasons, reimbursement rates are reduced, or if healthcare providers anticipate reimbursement being reduced, providers may narrow the circumstances in which they prescribe or administer our products, which could reduce the use and/or sales of our products. A reduction in the use and sales of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. For example, the 2007 creation of the FDAAA significantly added to the FDAs authority, allowing the FDA to (i) require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies; (ii) mandate labeling changes to products and (iii) require sponsors to implement a REMS for a product. Failure to comply with FDAAA requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased product liability risk. Current policy discussions underway in the United States include debates about the implementation of the new, abbreviated pathway for biosimilars established under the new healthcare reform law; renegotiation of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which governs the user fees pharmaceutical and biological companies pay to the FDA that provide a substantial portion of the FDAs operating budget, in anticipation of re-authorization before September 30, 2012; and reforms to the regulations that govern diagnostics and medical devices which are sometimes used in conjunction with our products. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. For example, in October 2009 we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA for the BLA for Prolia  in the treatment and prevention of PMO and in the treatment and prevention of bone loss due to hormone ablation therapy (HALT) in breast and prostate cancer patients. The Complete Response Letter related to the PMO indication requested several items, including further information on the design and background adverse event rates to inform the methodology of our previously submitted post-marketing surveillance program. The FDA also requested a new clinical program to support the approval of Prolia  for the prevention of PMO, updated safety data and stated that a REMS is necessary for Prolia  . The Complete Response Letter related to the HALT indication requested additional information regarding the safety of Prolia  in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy and patients with prostate cancer receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy. The FDA specifically requested results from additional adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating that Prolia  has no detrimental effects on either time to disease progression or overall survival. In addition, there may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. Further some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling requirements of regulators. Vectibix  , for example, received conditional approval in the United States and EU, with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix  as a therapy in treating mCRC. (See Marketed Products and Selected Product Candidates  Vectibix  (panitumumab).) If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products accelerated or conditional approval, we may not receive full approval for these products and may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Further, some of our products or product candidates may be used with a companion diagnostic product, such as a test kit, or companion device, such as an injector or other delivery system. These product candidates or expanded indications of our products may not be approved if the companion diagnostic product or companion device does not gain or maintain regulatory approval. These companion diagnostics and devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies in conducting the studies required for such approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. Delays in the studies or failure of the third-party company to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or device could negatively impact the approval of our product candidate or the expanded indication of our product and we may incur increased development costs, delays in regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. The occurrence of a number of high profile safety events has caused an increased public and governmental concern about potential safety issues relating to pharmaceutical and biological products and certain of our products and product candidates. (See Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) As a result of this increased concern in recent years, the U.S. regulatory environment has evolved and safety signals and safety concerns resulting from clinical trials (including sub-analyses and meta-analyses), market use or other sources are receiving greater scrutiny. Actual or perceived safety problems could lead to revised or restrictive labeling of our approved products or a class of products, potentially including limitations on the use of approved products in certain patients because of: ##TABLE_START   the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns with respect to any of our products by regulatory agencies    an increased rate or number of previously-identified safety-related events    the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products ##TABLE_END 44 ##TABLE_START   subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related to results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, or meta-analysis (a meta-analysis is the review of studies using various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) of clinical trials or clinical data performed by us or others    new legislation or rules by regulatory agencies ##TABLE_END For example, in December 2009, based on the TREAT results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. In October 2010, we submitted additional proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. We are working with the FDA to determine the appropriate use of ESAs in CKD patients and to determine any future ESA labeling changes required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting. (See Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) In addition to revised labeling for our products, discovery of new safety information or previously unknown safety concerns and/or safety signals with our products or similar products could also lead to: ##TABLE_START   requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) or other FDA compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products    mandated PMCs or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products    product recalls of our approved products    revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas, and/or    increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies    fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies ##TABLE_END Product safety concerns could cause regulatory agencies to impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS), which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop, implement and administer. The results of these risk management activities could: ##TABLE_START   impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products    limit patient access to our products    reduce patient willingness to use our products    place administrative burdens on healthcare providers in prescribing our products    affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS or similar risk management activities ##TABLE_END We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, ENBREL, Prolia  and Nplate  , and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of our REMS that include elements to assure safe use. For example, our Nplate  and ESA REMS each require applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the Nplate  and ESA REMS and providing the FDA with periodic assessment reports to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. If we or third-party service providers acting on our behalf fail to effectively implement and/or administer the REMS for our products, we may be required to modify such REMS, and we may be subject to FDA enforcement actions or to civil penalties. Further, if new medical data or product quality issues suggest an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may withdraw some or all affected product  either voluntarily or by regulatory mandate  in certain therapeutic areas, or completely recall a product presentation from the market for some period or permanently. For example, in September 2009, we initiated a voluntary recall of a limited number of ENBREL SureClick  lots due to a defect in the glass syringe barrel which resulted in a small number of broken syringes following assembly of the autoinjector device. In October 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of ENBREL due to identification of cracks in a small number of the glass syringes which may have resulted in product leakage and syringe breakage. Further, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN  and JJ voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT  , manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close collaboration with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products, which may adversely affect the sales of our products. Additionally, if other parties (including our independent clinical trial investigators or our licensees, such as JJ, Pfizer, Glaxo, Takeda and Daiichi Sankyo) report or fail to effectively report to regulatory agencies side effects or other safety concerns that occur from their use of our products in clinical trials or studies or from marketed use, resulting regulatory action could adversely affect the sales of our products and our business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the RD of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may not approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Further, safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) from the marketed use of our drugs or similar products that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use and sales of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. Beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESA products were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and reimbursement agencies. In the United States, the FDA continues to review the benefit-risk profile of ESAs, which have resulted and could result in future changes to ESA labeling and usage. For example, we revised the labeling for our ESAs in August 2008, as the FDA directed. In addition, in July 2007 CMS issued an NCD for non-renal ESAs that determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions, and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. Since these labeling and reimbursement changes, we experienced a substantial reduction in our ESA sales, in particular Aranesp  sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. In October 2009, the results from TREAT, a phase 3 pivotal study of patients with CKD not on dialysis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study failed to meet its primary objectives of demonstrating a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, including heart failure, heart attack, stroke or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, or time to ESRD. On December 16, 2009, based on the TREAT results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. CMS held a MEDCAC meeting on March 24, 2010 to examine the currently available evidence on the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients who have CKD, which considered the results from the TREAT study, and on June 16, 2010, CMS opened a new NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. On October 18, 2010 the FDAs CRDAC discussed the results from the TREAT study conducted in patients not on dialysis, and how those results informed the appropriate use of ESAs in patients with CKD. Prior to the CRDAC meeting, we submitted proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. A variety of opinions regarding the appropriate use of ESAs in patients with CKD were offered at the CRDAC meeting by the various meeting participants. On January 19, 2011, CMS held another MEDCAC meeting, this time to review the available evidence on the impact of ESA use on renal transplant graft survival. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) We are working with the FDA to determine the appropriate use of ESAs in CKD patients and we continue to cooperate with CMS in determining appropriate reimbursement for our ESAs. Although we cannot predict what impact all of these activities (including the revised ESA labeling; any future ESA labeling changes required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting or from our ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the conversion of the format of our ESA U.S. labels in accordance with the Physicians Labeling Rule; the outcome from the NCA or MEDCAC meetings, including an NCD; and the impact of the approved REMS for ESAs) could have on our business, these activities could, individually or together, have a material adverse impact on the coverage, reimbursement, use and/or sales of our ESAs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We also have ongoing PMCs for our ESAs that must be conducted to maintain regulatory approval and marketing authorization. We have agreed with the FDA to a robust pharmacovigilance program to continue to study the safety surrounding the use of ESAs in the oncology setting and we initiated Study782 as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program, a phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo. We continue to identify clinical sites for Study782 and to enroll patients in the study. In addition, JJPRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study, which evaluates the use of Epoetin alfa in patients with breast cancer, is ongoing and is designated as an FDA PMC. Further, in 2008 the FDA and the EMA reviewed interim results from the Preoperative Epirubicin Paclitaxel Aranesp  (PREPARE) study in neo-adjuvant breast cancer, a PMC study, which were ultimately incorporated into the ESA labeling in both the United States and the EU. We received the final results from the PREPARE study in 2009, which were substantially consistent with the interim results, and provided that data to the FDA and EMA. Although we cannot predict the results or the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, or the extent to which regulatory authorities may require additional labeling changes as a result of these or other trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that adverse results from clinical trials, including PMCs, could have a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also reviewed and scrutinized the use of our ESA products. In June 2008, the EMA recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients, which was approved by the EC in October 2008. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that, in some clinical situations, blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient. Since the October 2008 revision, we have experienced a reduction of Aranesp  sales in the supportive cancer care setting in the EU and, although we cannot predict what further impact the revised EU ESA product information could have on our business, the coverage, reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp  in Europe could further be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, we continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs, including PMCs, and adverse results could negatively impact the use and sales of our ESAs. For example, in September 2008, we announced that we had received a summary of preliminary results from the Cochrane Collaborations independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and the EMA. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient-level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion but they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. For example, in 2006 we delayed the start of our phase 3 trial in first-line NSCLC due to an increased frequency of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) in patients treated with our late-stage product candidate motesanib. Following initiation of the trial in November 2008, enrollment in this phase 3 trial was temporarily suspended following a planned safety data review of 600 patients by the studys independent DMC. In February 2009, the DMC recommended the trial resume enrollment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC only, and in June 2009, we reinitiated enrollment in this patient population following an FDA-approved revision to the study protocol. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, East Asia and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatorily diverse clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In the event that any of these vendors has unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of its work, our ability to evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis. Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators clinical trials which could: ##TABLE_START   delay the clinical trial program    require additional or longer trials to gain approval    prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products    render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, we have initiated Study782 as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. (See Our ESA products continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilar products, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. Lawmakers in the United States have recently enacted healthcare reform legislation which included an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. The EU has already created such a regulatory pathway. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2006, the EMA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products, including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, recommending that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct pharmacodynamic, toxicological and clinical safety studies as well as a pharmacovigilance program. Some companies have received and other companies are seeking approval to market erythropoietin and G-CSF biosimilars in the EU, presenting additional competition for our products. (See Our marketed products face substantial competition.) For example, following the expiration of the principal European patent relating to recombinant G-CSF in August 2006, the EC issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilar products and the products were launched in certain EU countries in 2008 and 2009. There are now several G-CSF biosimilars available in the EU marketed by different companies and these G-CSF biosimilar products compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . Further, as in an effort to reduce costs, countries in the EU may in the future permit the automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding innovator products. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA which authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a new abbreviated pathway. The new law established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlined statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting, for a period of 12 years, others from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The new law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation process, the FDA published several questions in the Federal Register for public comment. The FDA held a public meeting in November 2010 to seek stakeholder input on the subject and accepted written comments through 2010. The agency has the authority to approve biosimilar products but has not announced whether it will first publish guidance or rules for biosimilar applicants before approving biosimilar products. With the likely introduction of biosimilars in the United States, we expect in the future to face greater competition from biosimilar products and downward pressure on our product prices, sales and revenues, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. Further, biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period. President Obamas proposed 2012 budget includes a proposal to lower the data exclusivity period to seven years, but this would require new legislation be passed by the Congress. Critics may also encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. We may not be able to develop commercial products. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant RD investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START   the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine    the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness    the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics    the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals    the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use    the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize    other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all    we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities    the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined ##TABLE_END For example, after discussions with the FDA we have decided not to file for approval of motesanib in refractory thyroid cancer until there is more clarity on what would constitute an appropriate regulatory filing package for that indication. Further, several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) for the treatment of advanced Parkinsons disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The conclusion was reached even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinsons disease patients. Subsequently, we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease. Our marketed products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency. These companies may have greater resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, one of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita Inc. and Fresenius North America own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. In October 2006, we entered into a five-year sole sourcing and supply agreement with an affiliate of Fresenius North America, on its behalf and on behalf of certain of its affiliates, whereby they have agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to supply, all of Fresenius North Americas commercial requirements for ESAs for use in managing the anemia of its hemodialysis patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, based on forecasts provided by Fresenius North America and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START   regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others    adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier    unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise    failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall    discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components ##TABLE_END These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product use, sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. Further, quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently manufacture all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Nplate  and XGEVA tm and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START   availability or contamination of raw materials, components and equipment used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier    capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers    contamination by microorganisms or viruses    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise    degree of compliance with regulatory requirements    changes in forecasts of future demand    timing and actual number of production runs    updating of manufacturing specifications    production success rates and yields    timing and outcome of product quality testing ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to maintain supply and to satisfy anticipated future demand for denosumab, we are qualifying the expansion of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site. In addition, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site in order mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through a single distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and another in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA tm and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL, and all of the bulk manufacturing for Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. In addition, we expect/plan to perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA tm at the Puerto Rico facility once the facility has been approved by the FDA for that purpose. We also perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could adversely affect our operations, including: ##TABLE_START   power failures and/or other utility failures    breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment    improper installation or operation of equipment    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak    inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires ##TABLE_END 53 ##TABLE_START   failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA ##TABLE_END In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and such losses could materially adversely affect our product sales and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of ENBREL and EPOGEN  voluntarily recalled in 2009 and 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDAs expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. (See Note 19 , Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report.) A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. For example, despite the ongoing litigation, Teva has stated that it intends to sell its filgrastim product, upon approval from the FDA, in the United States without a license from us and prior to the expiration of our G-CSF patents. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, products approved by the FDA under a NDA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act has expired and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Over the next several years, the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may result in a reduction in the use and sales of our products. While we have, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection on certain of our products, including for specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products, competitors may be able to design around or otherwise circumvent any such additional patents and sell competing products. Although we continue to develop and obtain patent protection for new product candidates, we may not be able to replace the revenue lost upon the expiration of the patents on our current products. In recent years, policymakers have proposed reforming U.S. patent laws and regulations. For example, patent reform legislation was introduced in both the House and the Senate during the 111th Congress in 2009 but was not adopted into law. Legislation was again introduced in the Senate and passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 3, 2011. In general, the proposed legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for challenging patents. While we cannot predict what form any new patent reform laws or regulations may ultimately take, final legislation could introduce new substantive rules and procedures for challenging patents, and certain reforms that make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts, fines, penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We have received subpoenas from a number of government entities, including the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington, as well as the Attorneys General of New York and New Jersey. The federal subpoenas have been issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 3486), and by a federal grand jury, while the Attorneys General subpoenas have been issued pursuant to state specific statutes relating to consumer fraud laws and state false claims acts. The government is allowed to use materials produced in response to a section 3486 administrative subpoena in both criminal and civil investigations. In general, the subpoenas request documents relating to the sales and marketing of our products, and our collection and dissemination of information reflecting clinical research as to the safety and efficacy of our ESAs. Based on representations in a U.S. government filing, that became public in May 2009 relating to the Massachusetts Qui Tam Action, we now believe the subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington also relate to nine additional Qui Tam Actions which are purportedly pending against Amgen, including eight pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and one pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The U.S. government filing further alleges that a large number of states are involved in the Qui Tam investigations, led by the State of New York. These investigations are represented to be joint criminal and civil investigations. Throughout these investigations, and in litigation, the government entities are asserting that we violated various state and federal laws. These investigations are very burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for us to explain and defend to these entities. Although we cannot predict whether additional proceedings may be initiated against us, or predict when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time and to require managements attention and significant legal expense. A determination that we are in violation of the various federal and state laws that govern the sales and marketing of our products could result in federal criminal liability and/or federal or state civil or administrative liability, and thus could result in substantial financial damages or criminal penalties and possible exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology industry, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. Historically, we have occasionally and opportunistically accessed the capital markets to support certain business activities including acquisitions, in-licensing activities, share repurchases and to refinance existing debt. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) In the United States, there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of biosimilar or generic products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability.) Additionally, as a result of the current global economic downturn, our third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government and/or private payer healthcare programs or increased competition from lower cost biosimilar products could have a material adverse affect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. We are exposed to sovereign risk in some European countries where we sell directly to public healthcare systems. Economic and fiscal conditions in these countries could affect the amount and timing of the collection of our receivables. For example, the government of Greece has issued one-, two- and three-year zero-coupon bonds to various pharmaceutical vendors in lieu of payment of past due receivables dating from 2007 to 2009. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, the economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third-parties which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that has and may continue to contribute to lower sales of our products. For example, in the first quarter of 2009, certain of our wholesale distributors lowered their levels of inventory on hand, which we believe was done to reduce their carrying costs and improve their results of operations. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, health technology assessment organizations, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients, healthcare providers and payers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include: ##TABLE_START   In August 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) distributed to the nephrology community final updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD. The NKF-KDOQI tm Anemia Work Group recommended in its 2007 Update to the NKF-KDOQI tm Anemia Management Guidelines that physicians target Hb in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL, and also stipulated that the target not be above 13 g/dL.    In December 2008, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO), a not-for-profit foundation managed by NKF, announced that it was developing a new global anemia guideline. The announcement stated that an updated anemia guideline is necessary in light of new study results, particularly the data from the TREAT trial, which had become available since the NKF-KDOQI tm s clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD were released. KDIGO has stated that its new guidelines are expected to be released for public review and comment in early to mid-2011 and that final guidelines could be available by early 2012.    In February 2007, following the reported results from our Anemia of Cancer 103 Study, the U.S. Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp  in the treatment of anemia of cancer. ##TABLE_END 57 In addition, Health Technology Assessment organizations, such as NICE in the United Kingdom and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially adversely affected. Our corporate compliance and risk mitigation programs cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or that we effectively manage all operational risks. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations and/or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Additionally, while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. If we fail to effectively mitigate all operational risks, our product supply may be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations. Continual process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those efforts, we undertake continuous process improvement activities to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these process improvement initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws. In addition, President Obamas administration has announced proposals for U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. There are also other tax proposals that have been introduced, that are being considered, or that have been enacted by the U.S. Congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could materially adversely affect our provision for income taxes, tax liabilities or our results of operations. For example, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico recently enacted tax legislation effective on January 1, 2011 that, in certain circumstances, imposes a temporary excise tax for companies that purchase products from related Puerto Rico manufacturers.

Additionally, we believe it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a number of factors including stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and the impact of repurchases on our credit rating and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and previously filed Form 10-Ks for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results. ##TABLE_START (1) In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, related primarily to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (primarily in 2007) and loss accruals for leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our business.  (2) In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Domp Biotec, S.p.A (Domp). The purchase price paid was approximately $168 million, which included the carrying value of our existing 49% ownership in Domp. In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa, Inc. (Ilypsa) for a net purchase price of approximately $400 million. Also in July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Alantos Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (Alantos) for a net purchase price of approximately $300 million. In October 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Avidia, Inc. (Avidia) for a net purchase price of approximately $275 million. In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abgenix for a purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion.  (3) Included in cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) for 2007 is a charge of $30 million related to the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. ##TABLE_END 65 ##TABLE_START (4) Included in RD expenses for 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the RD technology intangible assets acquired with alternative future uses of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $71 million ($44 million, net of tax) and $48 million ($30 million, net of tax), respectively, acquired with the acquisitions of Avidia and Abgenix in 2006.  (5) Primarily represents the non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights, related primarily to ENBREL, acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Amortization charges, net of tax, for the five years ended December 31, 2010 were $186 million, $186 million, $183 million, $185 million and $200 million, respectively.  (6) As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos and Ilypsa in 2007 and Avidia and Abgenix in 2006, under the then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process RD (IPRD) of $270 million and $320 million in 2007, respectively, and $130 million and $1.1 billion in 2006, respectively. The charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPRD that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.  (7) In 2010 we incurred an asset impairment charge of $118 million ($74 million, net of tax) associated with a strategic decision to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities. In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (Ortho Biotech) antitrust suit. In 2007, we recorded a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. The remaining amounts included in Other charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007, related primarily to charges for cost saving initiatives and restructuring. (See Note 8, Cost savings initiatives and restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  (8) In 2010, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in October 2020 (the October 2020 Notes), $700 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2040 (the 2040 Notes), $600 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2041 (the 2041 Notes) and $300 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in March 2020 (the March 2020 Notes). In 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2019 (the 2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2039 (the 2039 Notes). In 2009, we repaid our $1.0 billion 4.00% notes. In 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2038 (the 2038 Notes). In 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes.  (9) In 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. In 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2008, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of those notes was used to repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in May 2007. In 2006, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Notes). In connection with the issuance of those notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also, concurrent with the issuance of those notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. Also, concurrent with the issuance of those notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million.  (10) Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2010, we had share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors through which we repurchased $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $5.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. ##TABLE_END 66 ##TABLE_START (11) Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes, including our 2011 Convertible Notes, 2013 Convertible Notes and zero coupon convertible notes, are included in Common stock and additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is the incremental non-cash interest expense of $266 million ($168 million, net of tax), $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax), $168 million ($88 million, net of tax) and $197 million ($141 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. ##TABLE_END 67 ##TABLE_START ", "7": " Item 7.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment  human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and ENBREL, all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business  Marketed Products. Throughout 2010 and early 2011, various developments occurred regarding our business, including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with certain of our marketed products and product candidates. Most notably, the FDA approved Prolia  and XGEVA tm , and the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia  for certain indications. In addition, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States. As a result of these and other developments, we have various opportunities to grow our business but will also continue to face various challenges. The following summarizes certain key opportunities and challenges. We have various opportunities to grow our business. In the near term, we believe the currently approved indications for Prolia  and XGEVA tm represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receipt of regulatory approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications for these products may also provide further significant opportunities. For example, the results of our recently announced phase 3 trial evaluating XGEVA tm versus placebo in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint. This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our late-stage pipeline and strategic business development opportunities, such as our recently announced agreement to acquire BioVex. In addition, longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan. Looking forward, we believe our products will continue to face various regulatory, reimbursement and competitive challenges. Our ESA products, in particular, have several near-term challenges that could result in further reductions in sales. For example, EPOGEN  sales will be impacted by the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis that became effective in 2011. Further, the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the results of the MEDCAC meetings held in March 2010 and January 2011 could lead to an NCD for the use of ESAs in patients with kidney disease, which could impact the use of or reimbursement for ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and/or dialysis-related anemia. In addition, the FDA-approved REMS for ESAs may continue to impact Aranesp  sales in the supportive cancer care setting. Future product label changes (including those we proposed prior to the 2010 CRDAC meeting, any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting and any from the PLR conversion process), may also impact the use of ESAs in CKD. Since we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the recently enacted healthcare reform law has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our products in the United States and on our results of operations. The provisions of the new legislation impacted our U.S. product sales by approximately $200 million in 2010, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be impacted by $250 million to $300 million. Furthermore, we estimate that our results of operations for 2011 will be impacted by an additional $150 million to $200 million related to a new fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs established by that legislation, which is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our products will also continue to face increasing competitive pressure, in particular ENBREL in the United States, as well as Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In addition, over the next several years, the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products.) Certain of these developments are expected to have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. However, these effects may be mitigated by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, discussed above, by other strategic initiatives or by increased efforts to manage our expenses. Selected Financial Data The following table presents selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START              2010 Change 2009  Product sales: U.S. $ 11,254 1% $ 11,135 International 3,406 6% 3,216 Total product sales 14,660 2% 14,351 Other revenues 393 35% 291 Total revenues $ 15,053 3% $ 14,642 Operating expenses $ 9,508 4% $ 9,136 Operating income $ 5,545 1% $ 5,506 Net income $ 4,627  $ 4,605 Diluted EPS $ 4.79 6% $ 4.51 Diluted shares 965 (5)% 1,021 ##TABLE_END The following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as well as our financial condition as of December 31, 2010. The increase in our U.S. product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for our ESA products, which declined 5%. The growth in sales of our non-ESA products reflects increases primarily in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. U.S. product sales in 2010 were unfavorably impacted by $198 million as a result of the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform law. The increase in our international product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for Aranesp  , which declined 1%. The increase in other revenues for 2010 was due primarily to milestone payments earned from Glaxo in connection with certain commercial milestones for Prolia  in the EU and from Takeda in connection with certain regulatory milestones for Vectibix  in Japan. The increase in operating expenses for 2010 was due principally to higher cost of sales, due primarily to higher bulk manufacturing costs, as well as higher selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses, due primarily to increased promotional costs for Prolia  and our other marketed products. Net income was relatively unchanged in 2010 as the increases in operating income, discussed above, and interest and other income were offset substantially by an increase in our provision for income taxes. The increase in interest and other income was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments and higher interest income. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due principally to reduced benefits resulting from settlements with tax authorities in 2010. The increase in diluted EPS for 2010 principally reflects a reduction in our weighted-average shares used to compute diluted EPS resulting from our stock repurchase program, including approximately 67 million shares repurchased in 2010 at a total cost of $3.8 billion. Although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the Euro. As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.4 billion, and total debt outstanding was $13.4 billion, including $2.5 billion which was repaid in February 2011. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if those funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                      2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  Aranesp  $ 2,486 (6) % $ 2,652 (15) % $ 3,137 EPOGEN  2,524 (2) % 2,569 5 % 2,456 Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  4,844 4 % 4,643  4,659 ENBREL 3,534 1 % 3,493 (3) % 3,598 Sensipar  /Mimpara  714 10 % 651 9 % 597 Vectibix  288 24 % 233 52 % 153 Nplate  229  110  17 Prolia  33     XGEVA tm 8     Other     70 Total product sales $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 Total U.S. $ 11,254 1 % $ 11,135 (3) % $ 11,460 Total International 3,406 6 % 3,216  3,227 Total product sales $ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 ##TABLE_END Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including, but not necessarily limited to: ##TABLE_START   our contracting and pricing strategies;    recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products;     legislative reform in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions;     cost containment pressures; and     the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   clinical trial outcomes, including adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices;    changes in clinical practice, including those resulting from the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments;    adoption of and adherence to risk management activities, such as a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;    product label changes;    patient population growth;    segment growth and penetration;    new product launches and indications;    expansion into new international markets; ##TABLE_END 71 ##TABLE_START   competitive products, including biosimilars;    patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights;    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;    adequacy of product supply and distribution;    effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including those conducted under collaboration agreements;    concentration of customer purchasing power; and    acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Our U.S. product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (eg, holiday-driven wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. In addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Aranesp  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                        2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  Aranesp   U.S. $ 1,103 (12 ) % $ 1,251 (24 ) % $ 1,651 Aranesp   International 1,383 (1 ) % 1,401 (6 ) % 1,486 Total Aranesp  $ 2,486 (6 ) % $ 2,652 (15 ) % $ 3,137 ##TABLE_END The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand, reflecting an overall decline in the segment. The decrease in international Aranesp  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in demand. U.S. sales of Aranesp  for 2008 benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves. Excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates, the decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales of approximately 21% for 2009 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand and a low single-digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price. The decline in unit demand reflects the negative impact, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of a product safety-related label change in August 2008 as well as an overall decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share. Excluding an $85 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Aranesp  sales for 2009 remained unchanged. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Aranesp  sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START   regulatory developments, including: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the REMS for our ESAs approved by the FDA in February 2010;     product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   reimbursement developments, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; and    development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp  . See Item 1. Business  Significant Developments, Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                      2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  EPOGEN   U.S. $ 2,524 (2)% $ 2,569 5% $ 2,456 ##TABLE_END The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand and certain changes in accounting estimates. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization, offset partially by patient population growth. The increase in EPOGEN  sales for 2009 was due primarily to an increase in unit demand and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average net sales price. The increase in unit demand was due principally to patient population growth and increased dose utilization. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN  sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START   reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    CMSs Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis;     Other CMS activities, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   regulatory developments, such as those resulting from product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process;    changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and    adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors are expected to have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN  . See Item 1. Business  Significant Developments, Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                      2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  Neulasta   U.S. $ 2,654 5% $ 2,527 1% $ 2,505 NEUPOGEN   U.S. 932 3% 901 1% 896 U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total 3,586 5% 3,428 1% 3,401 Neulasta   International 904 9% 828 2% 813 NEUPOGEN   International 354 (9)% 387 (13)% 445 International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total 1,258 4% 1,215 (3)% 1,258 Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 4,844 4% $ 4,643  $ 4,659 ##TABLE_END The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  for 2010 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for 2010 reflects primarily growth in Neulasta  principally from the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  to Neulasta  , offset partially by a decline in NEUPOGEN  as a result of biosimilar competition. The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  for 2009 was due primarily to a low single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. Excluding a $94 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales increased 4% for 2009, due primarily to an increase in demand, reflecting the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  to Neulasta  . In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                      2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  ENBREL  U.S. $ 3,304 1% $ 3,283 (3)% $ 3,389 ENBREL  Canada 230 10% 210  209 Total ENBREL $ 3,534 1% $ 3,493 (3)% $ 3,598 ##TABLE_END The increase in ENBREL sales for 2010 reflects an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a low single-digit percentage point decline in unit demand, resulting primarily from share declines in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2009 was due primarily to an unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 related to a shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model and a decline in unit demand as a result of competitive activity, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START                      2010 Change 2009 Change 2008  Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets presented below) $ 2,220 6 % $ 2,091 (9 )% $ 2,296 % of product sales 15.1% 14.6% 15.6% Research and development $ 2,894 1 % $ 2,864 (5 )% $ 3,030 % of product sales 19.7% 20.0% 20.6% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,983 4 % $ 3,820 1 % $ 3,789 % of product sales 27.2% 26.6% 25.8% Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets $ 294  $ 294  $ 294 Other charges $ 117 75 % $ 67 (82 )% $ 380 ##TABLE_END Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN  , PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. Cost of sales decreased to 14.6% of product sales for 2009, driven primarily by lower excess capacity charges, lower excess inventory write-offs, due primarily to the $84 million write-off of inventory in 2008 resulting from a strategic decision to change manufacturing processes, and lower royalty expenses. These decreases were offset partially by less favorable product mix and higher fill and finish costs resulting from lower utilization at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses include costs incurred under RD arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs and cost recoveries associated with collaborative RD and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs for arrangements with our corporate partners is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The increase in RD expenses for 2010 was driven primarily by $110 million of lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations and higher staff-related costs of $84 million. These increases were offset largely by lower licensing fees of $115 million, associated principally with payments made in 2009 under the Cytokinetics and Array BioPharma Inc. (Array) agreements, and reduced denosumab clinical trial costs of $73 million in 2010. The decrease in RD expenses for 2009 was driven primarily by lower clinical trial costs of $128 million, including those associated with our denosumab and Vectibix  registrational studies, our marketed products and the delay of the phase 3 motesanib NSCLC trial, and $14 million lower staff-related costs. The higher licensing fees incurred in 2009, which were related to the $60 million expense associated with the Array agreement and the $50 million expense resulting from the payment to Cytokinetics, were offset substantially by the $100 million expense in 2008 resulting from the upfront payment associated with the Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. collaboration. Selling, general and administrative SGA expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SGA expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs for collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. In connection with a collaboration agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada, and Pfizer is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBRELs profits owed to Pfizer is included in SGA expenses. The increase in SGA expenses for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia  and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan. The increase in SGA expenses for 2009 was due primarily to higher product promotional expenses of $207 million, including increased spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia  . This increase was offset substantially by lower litigation expenses of $38 million, lower expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share of $32 million, expense recoveries associated with our Glaxo collaboration agreement for Prolia  in PMO in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico of $29 million, lower staff-related costs of $28 million, lower global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system related expenses of $28 million and lower restructuring and related costs of $8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the expense associated with the ENBREL profit share was $1,184 million, $1,163 million and $1,195 million, respectively. Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. Other charges In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes The following table presents non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START              2010 2009 2008  Interest expense, net $ 604 $ 578 $ 551 Interest and other income, net $ 376 $ 276 $ 352 Provisions for income taxes $ 690 $ 599 $ 963 Effective tax rate 13.0% 11.5% 19.2% ##TABLE_END Interest expense, net Included in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $266 million, $250 million and $235 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2009 was due primarily to: lower interest income of $45 million, due principally to lower portfolio investment returns; lower net gains on sales of investments of $28 million; and higher losses on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations of $31 million; offset partially by higher foreign currency exchange net gains of $27 million. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to: the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2009 was due principally to: the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations; higher profits and manufacturing in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant; and a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements In January 2010, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 17, Fair value measurement. This standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard requires additional disclosure and requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity for Level 3 fair value measurements on a gross as opposed to a net basis. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, its adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2011, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which addresses the accounting for the annual fee due from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry beginning January 1, 2011, mandated by the PPACA and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to PPACA. We refer to these two laws collectively as the new healthcare reform law. The new healthcare reform law obligates a pharmaceutical manufacturer, upon the first gross receipt during a calendar year from prescription drug sales under any specified government program, to pay an annual fee to the U.S. government. The new accounting standard requires the liability for the annual fee to be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost established that is to be amortized and recognized as an operating expense over the calendar year that it is payable using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee. We have elected to amortize this fee on a straight-line basis and it will be recorded in SGA expense. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): ##TABLE_START          2010 2009  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 17,422 $ 13,442 Total assets 43,486 39,629 Current debt 2,488  Non-current debt 10,874 10,601 Stockholders equity 23,944 22,667 ##TABLE_END We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. In February 2011, our 2011 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion were repaid in full. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START          2010 2009  0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,488 $ 2,342 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,213 2,088 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 1,099 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 5.70% notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) 998 998 6.40% notes due 2039 (2039 Notes) 996 995 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 899 3.45% notes due October 2020 (October 2020 Notes) 897  5.75% notes due 2040 (2040 Notes) 696  4.95% notes due 2041 (2041 Notes) 595  6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) 499 499 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes) 499 499 4.50% notes due March 2020 (March 2020 Notes) 300  Other notes 183 182 Total borrowings 13,362 10,601 Less current portion (2,488 )  Total non-current debt $ 10,874 $ 10,601 ##TABLE_END We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2010, including: in 2010, $300 million principal amount of March 2020 Notes, $700 million principal amount of 2040 Notes, $900 million principal amount of October 2020 Notes and $600 million principal amount of 2041 Notes; in 2009, $1.0 billion principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.0 billion principal amount of 2039 Notes; and in 2008, $500 million principal amount of 2018 Notes and $500 million principal amount of 2038 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with these debt offerings totaled $17 million, $13 million and $6 million for debt issued in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are being amortized over the respective lives of the notes. All of these debt issuances as well as the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a make-whole amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of these debt issuances at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. In 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and in 2008, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based notes. See Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our Convertible Notes. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The effective rates on these swaps range from LIBOR plus 0.3% to LIBOR plus 2.6%. See Note 15, Financing arrangements and Note 18, Derivative instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2010, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.3 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2010, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. Annual commitment fees for this facility are 0.05% based on our current credit rating. As of December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration expires in April 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2010. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): ##TABLE_START              2010 2009 2008  Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,787 $ 6,336 $ 5,988 Net cash used in investing activities (4,152 ) (3,202 ) (3,165 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,232 ) (2,024 ) (3,073 ) ##TABLE_END Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 increased due primarily to higher net income of $553 million and a higher dividend payment from KA of $102 million, offset partially by the prior-year receipt of $300 million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with Takeda, and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others. Investing Net purchases of marketable securities were $3.5 billion for 2010 compared to net purchases of $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $580 million, $530 million and $672 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. Capital expenditures in 2008 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and with investment in our global ERP system and other information systems projects. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million. Financing In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock of which a total of $2.2 billion remains available as of December 31, 2010. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and the impact of repurchases on our credit rating, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START                          2010 2009 2008 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars  First quarter 29.1 $ 1,684 37.5 $ 1,997  $  Second quarter 10.3 616   32.7 1,549 (1) Third quarter 6.6 364    19 (1) Fourth quarter 20.5 1,136 21.7 1,211 12.6 700 Total 66.5 $ 3,800 59.2 $ 3,208 45.3 $ 2,268 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in May 2008. ##TABLE_END As discussed above, we issued debt securities in various offerings that resulted in net proceeds of $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we repaid $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion of notes in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $80 million, $171 million and $155 million of cash in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START                      Payments due by period Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond  Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 22,259 $ 2,900 $ 3,389 $ 1,892 $ 14,078 Operating lease obligations 1,009 140 246 189 434 Purchase obligations (2) 3,263 1,020 560 131 1,552 Unrecognized tax benefits (3) 200 200    Total contractual obligations $ 26,731 $ 4,260 $ 4,195 $ 2,212 $ 16,064 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2010 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. See Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations and our interest swap agreements.  (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.  (3) Long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $625 million at December 31, 2010 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to the above table, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third parties. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangements is approximately $2.1 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions (in millions): ##TABLE_START                      Cash Other Rebates Chargebacks discounts deductions Total  Balance as of January 1, 2008 $ 755 $ 70 $ 42 $ 197 $ 1,064 Amounts charged against product sales 1,813 1,635 324 466 4,238 Payments (2,064 ) (1,621 ) (323 ) (418 ) (4,426 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 504 84 43 245 876 Amounts charged against product sales 1,497 2,424 312 406 4,639 Payments (1,482 ) (2,380 ) (328 ) (355 ) (4,545 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 519 128 27 296 970 Amounts charged against product sales 1,522 2,593 347 572 5,034 Payments (1,525 ) (2,548 ) (345 ) (442 ) (4,860 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010 $ 516 $ 173 $ 29 $ 426 $ 1,144 ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total sales deductions were 25%, 24% and 22% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 2% for 2008. In late 2008, we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers (reflected as chargebacks in the table above) instead of rebates, resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks, as noted in the table above. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates primarily include amounts paid to payers in the United States and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which could take up to one year. Those rebates totaled $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 3.5% for 2008. These changes in annual estimates relate substantially to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 2% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2010 would have had an impact of approximately $30 million on our 2010 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices it pays us and the prices it charges the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Included in other deductions in the table above are rebates and discounts paid to state Medicaid offices to participate in the Medicaid program. In 2010, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States which has and will continue to significantly increase our Medicaid rebates and discounts. Certain provisions of this new legislation became effective in 2010, while others will become effective in later years. The provisions of this new legislation reduced our U.S. product sales in 2010 by approximately $200 million, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be negatively impacted by $250 million to $300 million by this legislation. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. In connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory, we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidates safety and efficacy, the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns. In addition, we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as consider the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date. Upon capitalization, we continue to monitor any changes in these factors. In the event of any significant negative developments, we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs. At December 31, 2009, we had capitalized approximately $258 million of inventory costs related to our then late-stage product candidate, denosumab. During 2010, we received various approvals for denosumab from regulatory authorities in the United States, the EU and various other countries and commenced selling the product in certain geographic markets. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Companys tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, substantial reform of U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits, requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance, as we deem appropriate. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. We also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed income led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2010. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments continued to decline as a result of the Federal Reserves monetary policy, which included a program to buy back U.S. Treasury instruments. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our investment portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government obligations; corporate debt securities; mortgage and asset backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $17.3 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009 would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2010 we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $13.4 billion and a fair value of $14.5 billion. As of December 31, 2009 we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $10.6 billion and a fair value of $11.6 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $760 million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would have resulted in a $213 million and $78 million, respectively, reduction in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive instruments Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2010 we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.2 billion and $398 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily Euro based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $376 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 the net unrealized gains and at December 31, 2009 the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $670 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2009 a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $720 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. Also at December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $670 million and $414 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of $134 million and $83 million, respectively, and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive instruments As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. We attempt to mitigate that risk through credit monitoring procedures. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the financial statements and schedule listed in Item 15(a)1 and (a)2 of Part IV and included in this Form 10-K Annual Report. ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010. Management determined that, as of December 31, 2010, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLPLos Angeles, California February 25, 2011 ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our or us) is the worlds largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We focus solely on human therapeutics and concentrate on innovating novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We were incorporated in 1980 and organized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. Our public website is www.amgen.com. On our website, investors can find press releases, financial filings and other information about the Company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, www.sec.gov, also offers access to reports and documents we have electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. As of December 31, 2011, we had 17,800 staff members worldwide. Approximately 6,500 of our staff members work in our research and development (RD) function, approximately 4,900 work in manufacturing, approximately 4,400 work in our commercial operations and the rest are in general and administrative functions. Currently, we market primarily recombinant protein therapeutics in supportive cancer care, inflammation and nephrology. Our principal products are Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), a pegylated protein, based on the Filgrastim molecule, and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), both of which selectively stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection); Enbrel  (etanercept), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a substance that plays a role in the bodys response to inflammatory diseases; and Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that stimulate the production of red blood cells. Our principal products represented 87%, 91% and 93% of our sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our other marketed products include Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), a small molecule calcimimetic that lowers serum calcium levels; Vectibix  (panitumumab), a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr); Nplate  (romiplostim), a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that mimics endogenous TPO, the primary driver of platelet production; and Prolia  (denosumab) and XGEVA  (denosumab), which both contain the same active ingredient but are approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets RANKL, an essential regulator of osteoclasts (the cells that break down bone). We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada. We have also entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization and marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships . ) Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which influence demand. The reimbursement environment continues to evolve with greater emphasis on both cost containment and demonstration of the economic value of products. In addition to our marketed products, we have various product candidates in mid- to late-stage development in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. Our RD organization has expertise in multiple treatment modalities, including large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) and small molecules. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities for all of our principal products as well as most of our product candidates. We operate a number of commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities, and our primary facilities are located in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.)  Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are very long  approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Upon approval, marketed products in our industry generally face substantial competition. Our industry is highly regulated, and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business. Government authorities in the United States and other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products as well as our ongoing RD activities. In recent years, regulators have placed a greater scrutiny on drug safety. This has led to, and may in the future lead to: fewer products being approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory bodies; delays in receiving approvals; additional safety-related requirements; restrictions on the use of products, including expanded safety labeling, or required risk management activities. Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments that occurred in 2011 and early 2012 affecting our business. A more detailed discussion of each development follows in the appropriate section. ESAs ##TABLE_START    The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective on January 1, 2011, and provides a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs that were previously reimbursed separately. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On June 24, 2011, we announced that the FDA approved changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (June 2011 ESA label changes). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related end stage renal disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP). The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond the QIPs measure that tracks the percent of a providers Medicare patients with a hemoglobin (Hb) level below 10 grams per deciliter (g/dL). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We entered into a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), commencing January 1, 2012, to supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. ##TABLE_END XGEVA  ##TABLE_START    On July 15, 2011, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for XGEVA  for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. ##TABLE_END Vectibix  ##TABLE_START    On November 10, 2011, the EC approved a variation to the marketing authorization for the use of Vectibix  in first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients whose tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    We announced on July 29, 2011, that we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line mCRC supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLA) for Vectibix  that we filed in late 2010. We are currently working to address their requests. ##TABLE_END   Motesanib ##TABLE_START    We along with our partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) announced that the motesanib pivotal phase 3 trial (MONET1) did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival in patients with advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ##TABLE_END Business combinations ##TABLE_START    On March 4, 2011, we acquired BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex), a privately held biotechnology company developing treatments for cancers and for the prevention of infectious disease, including talimogene laherparepvec (formerly referred to as OncoVEX GM-CSF ), a novel oncolytic vaccine in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of malignant melanoma. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On April 7, 2011, we acquired Laboratrio Qumico Farmacutico Brgamo Ltda (Bergamo), a privately held Brazilian pharmaceutical company that is a leading supplier of medicines to the hospital sector in Brazil with capabilities in oncology medicines. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On January 26, 2012, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Micromet, Inc. (Micromet), a publicly held biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012. ##TABLE_END Return of capital to shareholders ##TABLE_START    In the third quarter of 2011, we began paying quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock, aggregating $500 million paid in 2011. In December 2011, we increased our quarterly declared dividend by 29% to $0.36 per share of common stock, payable in March 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    During 2011, we repurchased approximately 15% of our stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010, for a total cost of $8.3 billion. ##TABLE_END Proposed legal settlement ##TABLE_START    We recorded a $780 million charge (the legal settlement charge) in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. ##TABLE_END Marketed Products We market our principal products, Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , in supportive cancer care, inflammation and nephrology. Certain of our marketed products face, and our product candidates, if approved, are also expected to face, substantial competition, including from products marketed by large pharmaceutical corporations, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. Our products competitive position among other biological and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement and patent position and expirations. Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilar products. A biosimilar product is a follow-on version of another biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is biosimilar to the original reference product. This demonstration will typically consist of comparative analytical, preclinical and clinical data from the biosimilar product to show that it has similar safety and efficacy as the reference product. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a new, abbreviated pathway. On February 9, 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents that provide insight into the FDAs current thinking on the development of biosimilar products and broad parameters for the scientific assessment of biosimilar applications. The FDA guidance documents leave room for the FDA to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the specifics of what evidence would be required for a biosimilar product to gain approval (see Government Regulation). In the European Union  (EU), there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition, including from manufacturers with biosimilar products approved in Europe that may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar, but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record. In some cases we may experience additional competition prior to the expiration of our patents as a result of agreements we have made in connection with the settlement of patent litigation with companies developing potentially competing products. (See, e.g., the discussions of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  later in this section). Further, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition to the challenges presented by competition, our existing products and product candidates are also subject to increasing regulatory compliance requirements that could be imposed as conditions of approval or after a product has been approved. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While such therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve relatively new or higher levels of scientific complexity and may therefore generate increased safety concerns. We design and implement comprehensive proactive pharmacovigilance programs for all of our products to help ensure the detection, assessment and communication of adverse effects. When deemed necessary and appropriate, additional measures for risk communication and mitigation are designed and implemented in consultation with regulatory agencies. As a condition of approval or due to safety concerns after a product has been approved, we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or studies, including postmarketing requirements (PMRs) and postmarketing commitments (PMCs). A PMR is a trial or study that a sponsor company is required by statute or regulation to conduct. A PMC is a trial or study that a sponsor company agrees to in writing, but is not required by law, to conduct. In addition, we may be required to implement risk management plans for our products in the various regions in which they are approved. For example, in 2008 the FDA began requiring risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) for various approved products to ensure that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. A REMS may also be imposed as a condition of approval or after a product has been on the market. A REMS may include a medication guide or a patient package insert, a healthcare provider communication plan or elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor company to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA evaluates such assessments and may require additional modifications to the REMS elements. REMS may also be modified as the FDA and companies gain more experience with REMS and how they are implemented, operated and monitored. We currently have REMS for a number of our marketed products. (See discussion on PMRs, PMCs and REMS in Government Regulation.) Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which influence demand. The reimbursement environment continues to evolve with greater emphasis on both cost containment and demonstration of the economic value of products. In addition, the current worldwide economic conditions have also contributed to increasing pressures on cost containment. Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen, Inc.  (K-A), a joint venture between Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin) and Amgen (see Business Relationships  Kirin-Amgen, Inc.) (See Business Rela tionships  K irin-Amgen, Inc . ) Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  stimulate production of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the bodys fight against infection. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. NEUPOGEN  is our registered trademark for Filgrastim, our recombinant-methionyl human G-CSF. Neulasta  is our registered trademark for pegfilgrastim, a pegylated protein based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule is added to the Filgrastim molecule. Because pegfilgrastim is eliminated through binding to its receptor on neutrophils and neutrophil precursor cells, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN  , which requires more frequent dosing. We market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  primarily in the United States and Europe. Filgrastim is also marketed under the brand name GRANULOKINE  in Italy. Neulasta  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Administration of Neulasta  in all cycles of chemotherapy is approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a clinically significant risk of febrile neutropenia. NEUPOGEN  was launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN  is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy; reducing the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; reducing the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in cancer patients who have undergone myeloablative chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation; and reducing the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Worldwide Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $5.2 billion, $4.8 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $4.0 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $1.2 billion.

Upon expiration of that patent, some companies received approval to market products, including biosimilars, that compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  in Europe, as further discussed below. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, severe chronic neutropenia and AML could negatively impact Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  sales. Further, NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe, and NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  . However, we believe the conversion in the United States is substantially complete and that a significant amount of the conversion in Europe has already occurred. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care setting.

On September 30, 2010, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional information from Teva Pharmaceutical to complete the review of its applications for approval of  Neutroval. If approved in the United States, this drug would compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  subject to the terms of the injunction and settlement agreement discussed below. On November 30, 2009, Teva Pharmaceutical filed a declaratory judgment action against us alleging that certain of our NEUPOGEN  patents are invalid and not infringed by Neutroval, and on January 15, 2010, we filed an answer and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that our patents are valid and infringed. On July 15, 2011, we announced that the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Teva Pharmaceutical and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (together defined as Teva) prohibiting them from infringing our patents relating to human G-CSF polypeptides and methods of treatment. The Courts injunction extends until November 10, 2013, after which date Teva will no longer be prohibited by the injunction from selling Neutroval in the United States, subject to receiving FDA approval for human therapeutic use. Teva also agreed not to sell Neugranin in the United States before November 10, 2013, unless it first obtains a final court decision that our patents are not infringed by Neugranin. Pursuant to the parties settlement, the launch date for either product could be sooner if certain unexpected events occur: a third party launches a similar G-CSF polypeptide product and we fail to sue that third party, or the patents are held invalid or unenforceable in a final court decision in an action brought by a third party. Enbrel  (etanercept) ENBREL is our registered trademark for etanercept, our TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to its receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune systems ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL binds certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation. We acquired the rights to ENBREL in July 2002 with our acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex). ENBREL was launched in the United States in November 1998 and in Canada in March 2001 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, ENBREL is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: moderate to severe active RA; chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; active psoriatic arthritis; and active ankylosing spondylitis. We market ENBREL under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada, which expires in the fourth quarter of 2013. (See Business Relationships  Pfizer Inc.) The rights to market and sell ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. ENBREL sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $3.7 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. In November 2011, we announced the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 8,063,182 related to ENBREL, which is owned by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) and exclusively licensed to Amgen. This patent, which has a term of 17 years from issuance, is reflected in the following table along with our other outstanding material patents for etanercept. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration  U.S.  TNFR DNA vectors, cells and processes for making proteins   10/23/2012  U.S.  Aqueous Formulation (1)   2/27/2023  U.S.  Fusion protein, and pharmaceutical compositions   11/22/2028  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  This formulation patent relates to the currently approved liquid formulation of ENBREL, which formulation accounts for the majority of ENBREL sales in the United States. However, ENBREL is also sold as an alternative lyophilized formulation that requires reconstituting before it can be administered to the patient. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating rheumatologic conditions, which includes moderate to severe RA; moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis; and dermatologic conditions, which includes moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis, could negatively impact ENBREL sales. Certain of the treatments for these indications include generic methotrexate and other products.

Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of a protein called erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count can result in anemia, a condition in which insufficient oxygen is delivered to the bodys organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with CKD in patients either on or not on dialysis. Individuals with CKD may suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys and stimulates erythropoiesis. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with non-myeloid malignancies. ESAs, including ours, have faced and continue to face challenges. For example, based on adverse safety results observed beginning in late 2006 in various studies, performed by us and by others, that explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label, the product labeling of our ESAs in the United States and the EU has been updated several times to reflect those safety concerns. In addition, due in part to certain of these developments, reimbursement of our ESAs in the United States was also revised resulting in changes in the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, including by decreasing the number of treated patients, average dose and duration of ESA therapy.  Further, the following developments occurred with respect to ESAs in 2011: ##TABLE_START    CMSs Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective on January 1, 2011, and provides a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs that were previously reimbursed separately (except for oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  , which will be included in the bundle beginning in 2014). Substantially all dialysis providers in the United States opted into the bundled payment system in its entirety on January 1, 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On June 24, 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved the June 2011 ESA label changes. While the previous label language specified a Hb target range of 10-12 g/dL for chronic renal failure (CRF) patients on dialysis as well as those not on dialysis, the modified labeling provides separate treatment guidance for these two populations. For patients on dialysis, who constitute the majority of CKD (or CRF) patients receiving ESA treatment, the new label advises physicians to initiate ESA therapy when the Hb level is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose when the Hb approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL. For CKD patients not on dialysis receiving ESA treatment, the new label advises physicians to initiate ESA therapy when the Hb level is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose when the Hb exceeds 10 g/dL. (With the June 2011 label changes, the FDA changed the term CRF to CKD in the ESA labels. We use CRF when referring to labels prior to June 2011 for historical accuracy.) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On November 1, 2011, CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP. The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond the QIPs measure that tracks the percent of a providers Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL. CMS indicated that removal of this measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    On June 16, 2010, CMS opened a National Coverage Analysis (NCA) to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Following further analysis, on June 16, 2011, CMS issued a Final Decision Memorandum (FDM) in which it determined that it would not issue a National Coverage Determination (NCD) at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD, and that it would instead monitor the use of ESAs through its bundled payment system and its other policy avenues. In the absence of an NCD, Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) may be made by 11 regional contractors called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), which CMS contracts with to process Medicare claims. LCDs are binding on providers within their respective jurisdictions. Since CMS issued their FDM, one MAC has issued a final LCD relating to anemia in patients with CKD not on dialysis, and two more MACs have issued draft LCDs, all of which would restrict reimbursement to use in accordance with the revised label. Nonetheless, physician behavior may change at any time to be consistent with the label even before formal LCDs are implemented. ##TABLE_END Certain of these developments have had a material adverse impact on sales of our ESAs. In addition, in November 2011, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita, commencing January 1, 2012, to supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Effective January 1, 2012, we also entered into a three-year non-exclusive supply agreement to supply EPOGEN  to Fresenius Medical Care North America, a subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care AG  Co. KGaA (Fresenius Medical Care), following the 2011 expiration of our five-year ESA supply agreement with them. We have an ongoing oncology pharmacovigilance program in place for Aranesp  . Of the clinical trials included in the program, five explore the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label and are designated by the FDA as PMCs. Of the five studies, one was sponsored by Amgen while the other four were investigator-sponsored. Results of certain of those studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESAs and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. Of the five studies, four are complete with final results of the remaining study expected in 2012. In addition, Janssen Research  Development, LLC (JRD), a subsidiary of JJ, and/or its investigators have conducted numerous studies that contribute to the understanding of ESA safety. Results of the JRD studies were submitted to the FDA.  Additionally, based on discussions with the FDA, we and JRD have carefully considered potential new study designs to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Based on those discussions, we are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing advanced NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo (Study 782) as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. In addition, JRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study in breast cancer is ongoing. Both studies are designated by the FDA as PMR clinical trials. For the nephrology setting, we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding additional PMRs to explore alternative ESA dosing strategies in CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. Adverse events or results of any of these studies could further affect product labeling, healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and/or reimbursement practices related to Aranesp  or EPOGEN  . Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license by K-A to manufacture and market Aranesp  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We market Aranesp  primarily in the United States and Europe. Aranesp  was launched in 2001 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF (both in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Worldwide Aranesp  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, U.S. Aranesp  sales were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and international Aranesp  sales were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

MIRCERA  has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5)  A subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical. ##TABLE_END In addition to competition from these marketed products, Affymax, Inc. (Affymax) and Takeda are co-developing peginesatide, a synthetic, PEGylated peptidic compound that binds to and stimulates the erythropoietin receptor and thus acts as an ESA, for the treatment of anemia in CRF patients on dialysis and have submitted an NDA to the FDA. On December 7, 2011, Affymax and Takeda announced that the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) panel voted 15 to 1, with 1 abstention, that peginesatide demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit profile for use in the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia due to CKD. The FDA has targeted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of March 27, 2012. EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market EPOGEN  in the United States under a licensing agreement with K-A. We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a subsidiary of JJ (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Janssen), a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all indications other than dialysis. We launched EPOGEN  in the United States in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with CRF in patients who are on dialysis. We market EPOGEN  in the United States for the treatment of anemic adult and pediatric patients with CRF who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is indicated for elevating or maintaining the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or Hb measurements) and decreasing the need for blood transfusions in these patients. EPOGEN  sales in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $2.0 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for epoetin alfa are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration  U.S.  Process of making erythropoietin   8/15/2012  U.S.  Product claims to erythropoietin   8/20/2013  U.S.  Pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin   8/20/2013  U.S.  Cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin   5/26/2015  ##TABLE_END  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with renal failure could negatively impact EPOGEN  sales. In the United States, as noted above, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. In addition, EPOGEN  could face additional competition from those products noted in the Aranesp  section above that may be used in dialysis in the United States. Other Marketed Products Our other marketed products include Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), Vectibix  (panitumumab), Nplate  (romiplostim), Prolia  (denosumab) and XGEVA  (denosumab). Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  is our registered trademark in the United States and Mimpara  is our registered trademark in Europe for cinacalcet, our small molecule medicine used in treating CKD patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. In 2004, Sensipar  /Mimpara  was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In 2008, Mimpara  was approved in Europe for the reduction of hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) where a parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. In 2011, Sensipar  was approved in the United States for the treatment of severe hypercalcemia in patients with PHPT who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy. We market Sensipar  primarily in the United States and Mimpara  primarily in Europe. As previously discussed, CMSs Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective on January 1, 2011 and provides a single payment for all dialysis services. Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will continue to be reimbursed separately under the Medicare Part D benefit until 2014 when they will be reimbursed under the bundled payment system. Inclusion in the bundled payment system may reduce utilization of these oral drugs and have a material adverse impact on Sensipar  sales. (See Reimbursement . ) The phase 3 EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (E.V.O.L.V.E) trial, initiated in 2006, is a large (3,800 patient), multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects of Sensipar  /Mimpara  on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. The E.V.O.L.V.E study completed enrollment in January 2008 and we anticipate data from the study in 2012. Worldwide Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $808 million, $714 million and $651 million, respectively.

(Barr) for infringement of four Sensipar  patents. The lawsuit was based on Abbreviated New Drug Applications filed by Teva and Barr that sought approval to market generic versions of Sensipar  . Following trial, on January 7, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware granted an injunction prohibiting Teva and Barr from commercializing generic versions of Sensipar  in the United States until expiration of three of those patents. These generic versions could compete with Sensipar  in the future. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is our registered trademark for panitumumab, our monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens. EGFr is a protein that plays an important role in cancer cell signaling and is over-expressed in many human cancers. Vectibix  binds with high affinity to EGFrs and interferes with signals that might otherwise stimulate growth and survival of the cancer cell. We acquired full ownership of Vectibix  with our acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. (Abgenix) in April 2006. In September 2006, Vectibix  received FDA accelerated approval in the United States, based upon clinical trial data from a study demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and with the condition that Amgen conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the clinical benefit of panitumumab through demonstration of an improvement in overall survival. (See discussion of the 181 trial below.) In the EU, the conditional approval of Vectibix  as monotherapy, for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens, was received in December 2007 and is reviewed annually by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Each year thereafter, the EU conditional marketing authorization was renewed with an additional specific obligation to conduct a clinical trial in the approved monotherapy indication. In 2010, we began enrollment for this additional clinical trial which compares the effect of Vectibix  versus Erbitux  (cetuximab) on overall survival for chemorefractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS genes. KRAS is a protein found in all human cells. Some colorectal cancers have mutations in the KRAS gene. Vectibix  has been shown to be ineffective in people whose tumors had KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13. In 2009, we announced results from the 203 and 181 pivotal phase 3 trials evaluating Vectibix  in combination with chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) as a first- and second-line treatment for mCRC, respectively. Both studies demonstrated that Vectibix  administered with chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. Additionally, both studies showed numeric improvements in median overall survival in the same patient population. The numeric improvements in median overall survival failed to achieve statistical significance. It was previously agreed with the FDA that the 181 study would serve as the confirmatory trial for establishing full approval for the mCRC indication.  On February 8, 2011, we and four other sponsor companies met with the FDA and the ODAC to discuss the status of our respective PMCs for product indications that had been granted accelerated approval by the FDA prior to 2009, including Vectibix  . At that meeting, we updated the Committee on the completion and submission of the main PMC for Vectibix  and on the confirmatory 181 study; and we participated in an open discussion with the ODAC on the accelerated approval process. On July 29, 2011, we announced that we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line mCRC sBLAs that we filed in late 2010. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies but did request an updated safety analysis and additional analyses of the overall survival data in the 181 and 203 studies using more mature data sets. The FDA has also informed us that approval for the first- and second-line mCRC indications will be contingent upon approval of the companion diagnostic device being developed in collaboration with QIAGEN N.V., which identifies a patients KRAS gene status. We are currently working on addressing the FDAs requests in the Complete Response Letters. On November 10, 2011, the EC approved a variation to the marketing authorization for Vectibix  to include indications for the treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC in first- and second-line in combination with chemotherapy. Worldwide Vectibix  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $322 million, $288 million and $233 million, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for panitumumab are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr  4/8/2020 U.S.  Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr  5/5/2017 Europe  Fully human antibodies that bind EGFr  12/3/2017 Europe (1)  Human monoclonal antibodies to EGFr  5/5/2018 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating mCRC after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens could negatively impact Vectibix  sales.

Bayer is in discussions with health authorities worldwide regarding next steps in filing for approval. ##TABLE_END Nplate  (romiplostim) In August 2008, the FDA approved Nplate  for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in splenectomized (spleen removed) and non-splenectomized adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Nplate  works by raising and sustaining platelet counts. We were granted an exclusive license by K-A to manufacture and market Nplate  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In  February 2009, we announced that the EC had granted marketing authorization for Nplate  for the treatment of splenectomized adult chronic ITP patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g., corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). In the EU, Nplate  may also be considered as second-line treatment for adult non-splenectomized ITP patients where surgery is contraindicated. Worldwide Nplate  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $297 million, $229 million and $110 million, respectively. Our outstanding material patents for romiplostim are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Thrombopoietic compounds  1/19/2022 U.S.  Thrombopoietic compounds  10/22/2019 Europe (1)  Thrombopoietic compounds  10/22/2019 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  In some cases, this European patent may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. ##TABLE_END Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating thrombocytopenia in splenectomized and non-splenectomized adults with chronic ITP could negatively impact Nplate  sales.

We have a collaboration agreement with Glaxo Group Limited (Glaxo), a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK, for the commercialization of denosumab in certain countries. (See Business Relationships  Glaxo Group Limited.) Prolia  On June 1, 2010, the FDA approved Prolia  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. On September 19, 2011, we announced that the FDA approved two additional indications for Prolia  as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. We estimate that the large majority of Prolia  usage to date in the United States has been under Medicare Part B. Additionally, most potential U.S. Prolia  patients now also have coverage for Prolia  under Medicare Part D. Future U.S. product sales for Prolia  will depend primarily on postmenopausal osteoporosis disease state awareness, the willingness of primary care physicians to prescribe the product and the availability of reimbursement for and patient acceptance of the product. On May 25, 2010, the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. Since the first reimbursement authority was received in Germany in July 2010, reimbursement authority approval has been granted in most EU countries. Worldwide Prolia  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $203 million and $33 million, respectively.  Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) in women at high risk for fracture could negatively impact Prolia  sales. The following table and discussion reflect other companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Prolia  .

The following companies have product candidates in phase 3 clinical development that may compete with Prolia  in the future: ##TABLE_START    Merck (odanacatib), for PMO. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Radius Health, Inc. (BA058) for PMO. ##TABLE_END XGEVA  On November 18, 2010, the FDA approved XGEVA  for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. XGEVA  is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. On May 17, 2011, we announced results of a pivotal phase 3 trial (Study 147) in 1,432 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has not yet spread to bone. The trial demonstrated that XGEVA  significantly improved median bone metastasis-free survival by 4.2 months compared to placebo (primary endpoint) and significantly improved time to first occurrence of bone metastases (secondary endpoint). Overall survival was similar between the XGEVA  and placebo arms (secondary endpoint), and adverse events and serious adverse events were relatively similar. Hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were reported with increased frequencies in the XGEVA  treated patients compared to placebo. The yearly rate of ONJ in the XGEVA  arm was similar to prior XGEVA  trial results. Back pain was the most common adverse event reported in the XGEVA  arm of the trial. On June 27, 2011, we announced the submission of an sBLA to the FDA to expand the indication to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer to reduce the risk of developing bone metastases. On February 8, 2012, the FDA convened the ODAC to discuss the sBLA filing. The ODAC panel voted 12 to 1 that the overall magnitude of benefit demonstrated with early treatment with XGEVA  to delay bone metastases was not sufficient to conclude a positive risk-benefit ratio in the absence of additional measures impacting quality of life or other disease outcomes. The FDA often seeks the advice of an advisory committee such as ODAC when evaluating a potential new treatment. The FDA has targeted a PDUFA action date of April 26, 2012.  On July 15, 2011, we announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for XGEVA  for the prevention of SREs (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. The timing of reimbursement authority approval of pricing in individual EU countries will vary by country, which could follow the EC approval by many months. For example, in August 2011, XGEVA  received reimbursement authority in Germany. The EC also granted XGEVA  an additional year of data and market exclusivity in the EU since the indication was considered new for denosumab and based on the significant clinical benefit of XGEVA  in comparison with existing therapies. U.S. XGEVA  sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $351 million and $8 million, respectively. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors could negatively impact XGEVA  sales. The following table reflects currently marketed products that compete with XGEVA  .

We have also entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization and marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships .) Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers  through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, and also through the Internet. In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat, as well as provide support to various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas. (See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion for a discussion of the government regulation over product marketing and promotion.) In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors. We utilize those wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. In Europe, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers, and we limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, for certain customers, by requiring letters of credit. We had product sales to three customers each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For 2011, on a combined basis, these customers accounted for 72% and 90% of worldwide gross revenues and U.S. gross product sales, respectively, as noted in the following table. Certain information with respect to these customers for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009  AmerisourceBergen Corporation:    Gross product sales  $ 7,574   $ 7,678   $ 7,179  % of total gross revenues   36%    38%    37%  % of U.S. gross product sales   45%    47%    46%  McKesson Corporation:    Gross product sales  $ 4,591   $ 3,913   $ 3,694  % of total gross revenues.   22%    19%    19%  % of U.S. gross product sales   27%    24%    24%  Cardinal Health, Inc:    Gross product sales  $ 3,021   $ 2,813   $ 2,841  % of total gross revenues.   14%    14%    15%  % of U.S. gross product sales   18%    17%    18%  ##TABLE_END Reimbursement Sales of all of our principal products are dependent in large part on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. Most patients receiving our products are covered by government healthcare programs or private insurers. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may adopt or be influenced by government coverage and reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. An increasing worldwide focus on patient access controls and cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our products. In addition, recent healthcare reform efforts enacted in the United States have made substantial long-term changes to the reimbursement of our products, and those changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business. U.S. Reimbursement System Our principal products are sold primarily in the United States and healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals and other healthcare professionals and providers, are reimbursed for covered services and products they use by the government through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers. Government healthcare programs are funded primarily through the payment of taxes by individuals and businesses. The public and private components of this multi-payer system are described below.   Medicare and Other Forms of Public Health Insurance Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities or ESRD, regardless of their age. The primary Medicare programs that affect reimbursement for our products are Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and outpatient care, and Medicare Part D, which provides a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare (as well as Medicaid, described below) and, among its responsibilities, has authority to promulgate regulations and policies, as well as issue reimbursement codes for drugs, all of which can determine how medical items and services are covered and reimbursed by Medicare. CMS can also issue Medicare NCDs which are national policy statements granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage for specific medical items or services applicable throughout the United States. In the absence of a relevant NCD, Medicare coverage determinations for a particular medical item or service are left to MACs, whose LCDs are binding on providers within their respective jurisdictions. CMS sometimes uses advisory committees of external experts in order to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. For example, the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) was established to provide independent guidance and expert advice to CMS on specific clinical topics. The MEDCAC reviews and evaluates medical literature, technology assessments, and examines data and information on the effectiveness and appropriateness of medical items and services that are covered under Medicare, or that may be eligible for coverage under Medicare. Medicare Part B Coverage of Drugs and ESRD. Medicare Part B provides limited coverage of outpatient drugs and biologicals that are reasonable and necessary for a medically accepted diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury and that fall into a statutory benefit category. One such category relevant to our products is for drugs and biologicals furnished incident to a physicians services. Generally, incident to drugs and biologicals are covered if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that are not usually self-administered by the patient. Medicare Part B also covers certain drugs pursuant to specific statutory benefit categories, such as blood-clotting factors and certain immunosuppressive drugs, erythropoietin and certain oral cancer drugs. Many of our principal products are currently covered under Medicare Part B (as well as other government healthcare programs). In addition, most patients with ESRD, regardless of age, are eligible for coverage of dialysis treatment through the ESRD Program under Medicare Part B. Because Medicare Part B is the primary payer for dialysis treatment, reimbursement for products, such as EPOGEN  , that are typically administered in dialysis centers and other settings is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement policy. Since January 1, 2011, dialysis treatment has been reimbursed by Medicare under a bundled payment system described in more detail below. (See Dialysis Reimbursement.) Medicare Part D . Medicare Part D provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit for Medicare eligible beneficiaries. The coverage is available through various private plans that provide insurance coverage for prescription drugs for a monthly premium and with patient cost sharing. The list of prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D plans varies by plan, but drug lists maintained by individual plans must cover certain classes of drugs and biologicals; specifically the statute stipulates that Medicare Part D plans have at least two drugs in each unique therapeutic category or class, subject to certain exceptions. Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by individual states for low-income and disabled eligible beneficiaries. CMS also has responsibility for federal administration of the Medicaid program. Under federal law, states must cover low-income adults and children, pregnant women, disabled individuals and seniors, and states have the option of expanding eligibility beyond those groups of beneficiaries. Medicaid is financed jointly by the states and federal government through taxes. Medicaid offers a broad set of benefits, including prescription drugs. Medicaid includes the Drug Rebate Program which requires manufacturers to provide rebates to the states for products covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Private Health Insurance Employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance currently represents the main pathway by which Americans receive private health insurance. Many employers provide health insurance as part of  employees benefit packages. Insurance plans are administered by private companies, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and some companies are self-insured (i.e., they pay for all healthcare costs incurred by employees directly through a plan administered by a third party). Generally, employer-sponsored insurance premiums are paid primarily by employers and secondarily by employees. Individual market. The individual market covers part of the population that is self-employed or retired. In addition, it covers some people who are unable to obtain insurance through their employers. The plans are administered by private insurance companies. Individuals pay out-of-pocket insurance premiums for coverage, and the benefits vary widely according to plan specifications. Reimbursement of Our Principal Products Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  . Medicare and Medicaid payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. The Medicare program covers our principal products Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  (as well as certain of our other products including Vectibix  , Nplate  , Prolia  and XGEVA  ) under Part B, when administered in the physician clinic setting and the hospital outpatient settings. Healthcare providers are reimbursed for these products under a buy and bill process where providers purchase the product in advance of treatment and then submit a reimbursement claim to Medicare following administration of the product. Medicare reimburses providers using a payment methodology based on a fixed percentage of each products average sales price (ASP). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current Period) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a defined period of time preceding the Current Period. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect so healthcare providers will know the applicable reimbursement rates. In the calculation of ASP, CMS currently allows manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices and in the future CMS may provide more specific guidance. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, hospital outpatient setting and, to a lesser extent, the dialysis facility setting. (See EPOGEN  and Dialysis Reimbursement.) Our ASP calculations are reviewed quarterly for completeness and based on such review, we have on occasion restated our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. (See Items 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) Since 2005, products provided in the physician office setting under Medicare Part B have been reimbursed at 106% of their ASP (sometimes referred to as ASP+6%), and in 2012 will continue to be reimbursed at this rate pursuant to the 2012 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule. In the hospital outpatient setting, from 2006 to 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates fell incrementally from ASP+6% to ASP+4%, then rose in 2011 to ASP+5%. Pursuant to the 2012 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment Final Rule, the rate will fall again to ASP+4% in 2012. CMS has the regulatory authority to further adjust formulas in future years. The extent to which commercial payers adopt the use of ASP as a payment methodology is often based on the contractual relationship between the provider and the insurer. Dialysis Reimbursement. Currently, dialysis providers in the United States are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by Medicare through the ESRD Program, which is established by federal law and implemented by CMS. Historically, the ESRD Program reimbursed Medicare providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder was paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers, at ASP+6%, using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMSs bundled payment system went into effect for dialysis providers which provides a single payment for all dialysis services including drugs, supplies and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. ESRD providers receive a designated payment for each dialysis treatment and can be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more frequent treatments. Oral  drugs without intravenous equivalents, including Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will remain under the Medicare Part D benefit until 2014 when they will be reimbursed under the bundled payment system. To encourage dialysis providers to continue to provide quality dialysis treatment under the new bundled payment system, CMS also implemented the ESRD QIP. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, ESRD facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2% of amounts reimbursed for failure to meet or exceed CMS quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy. Under the QIP as originally implemented, a providers penalty in 2012 will be based on the providers composite score for the following performance measures achieved during 2010: ##TABLE_START    the percent of Medicare patients with Hb levels below 10 g/dL constitutes 50% of the weighting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the percent of Medicare patients with Hb levels above 12 g/dL represents 25% of the weighting; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the percent of Medicare patients with an average Urea Reduction Ratio of greater than or equal to 65% constitutes 25% of the weighting. ##TABLE_END On November 1, 2011, CMS finalized a rule to update the QIP, eliminating for payment year 2013 and beyond the QIPs measure that tracks the percent of a providers Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL. Beginning in payment year 2013, the remaining two metrics will each constitute 50% of the weighting. CMS indicated that removal of this measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. ENBREL Reimbursement. The majority of prescription claims for ENBREL are paid through private insurance companies. Under Medicare, ENBREL is reimbursed through the Part D program, although less than 10% of all ENBREL U.S. prescriptions are reimbursed by Medicare. Medicaid Reimbursement Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program established in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments of that law. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate to the states for each unit of our product reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. As more fully described below, the healthcare reform law enacted in the United States in March 2010 made certain changes in how those rebates are calculated and to whom they must be extended. (See U.S. Healthcare Reform . ) The amount of the rebate for each of our products is currently set by law as a minimum of 23.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any non-government customer. The rebate amount is determined for each quarter based on our reports to CMS of the quarters AMP and best price for each of our products. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. As described below, the statutory definition of AMP changed in 2010 as a result of the U.S. healthcare reform law, and in January 2012, CMS issued a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is finalized, we are required to make reasonable assumptions when calculating AMP. Once CMSs proposed rule is finalized, we will have to determine whether our calculations should be amended and whether we will need to restate our prior AMPs.The terms of our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. Related to our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program is a requirement that we extend comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) drug pricing program to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As more fully described below, the list of entities to which we are required to extend these discounts also expanded as a result of the U.S. healthcare reform law.   We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHC Act), federal law has required that we offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of our products under the Medicaid program or purchase of our products by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. The accuracy of our reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs and our FSS contract prices may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws and the terms of our FSS contract. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies in calculation of Non-FAMPs and FCPs is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified Federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. Also, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false Non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. Finally, we are required to disclose in our FSS contract proposal all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than our proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, we are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. U.S. Healthcare Reform. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA) and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to the PPACA, primarily with respect to the PPACAs financial and budgetary impacts, were signed into law. We refer to those two laws collectively as the U.S. healthcare reform law. The U.S. healthcare reform law imposes additional costs on and reduces the revenue of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The following paragraphs describe certain provisions of the new healthcare reform law that are affecting and will affect the reimbursement of our products. The U.S. healthcare reform law increased the rebates we pay to the states for our products that are covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. The healthcare reform law increased the minimum base Medicaid rebate rate payable on our products reimbursed by Medicaid from 15.1% to 23.1% of the AMP of the product, or if it is greater, the difference between the AMP and the best price available from us to any non-government customer. The change in the minimum rebate percentage was effective on January 1, 2010. The healthcare reform law also extended the Medicaid drug rebate program to patients in Medicaid managed care insurance plans for whom rebates were not previously required. The extension of rebates to patients in Medicaid managed care plans was effective on March 23, 2010. As mentioned above, the U.S. healthcare reform law also expanded the list of provider institutions to which we must extend discounts under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. The U.S. healthcare reform law added certain cancer centers, childrens hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers to the list of entities to which these discounts must be extended. This change to the list of eligible entities was effective on January 1, 2010. The U.S. healthcare reform law also imposed a new fee (the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee) on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, which includes drugs approved under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or biologicals licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act. Beginning in 2011, the U.S. healthcare reform law sets an aggregate annual fee, to be paid by these manufacturers and importers, totaling $28 billion over 10 years, of which $2.5 billion was payable in 2011. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies, including us, based on each companys sales of qualifying products to, and utilization by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The additional fee became effective January 1, 2011, and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Manufacturers and importers of generic or biosimilar drugs are not subject to the fee. Since the Medicare Part D drug benefit took effect in 2006, beneficiaries enrolled in Part D plans have been required to pay 100% of their prescription drug costs after their total drug spending exceeds an initial coverage limit until they qualify for catastrophic coverage. This coverage gap is sometimes referred to as the Part D  doughnut hole. The U.S. healthcare reform law reduces the doughnut hole by requiring manufacturers like us to provide a 50% discount to Medicare Part D patients whose prescription expenses exceed the Part D prescription drug coverage limit but have not yet reached the catastrophic coverage threshold. This provision became effective January 1, 2011. The U.S. healthcare reform law also expands the Medicaid eligibility to include those with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), from 100% of the FPL. This provision becomes effective January 1, 2014. Impact of Budget Control Act on U.S. Reimbursement The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law in the United States in August 2011, mandated a two percent reduction in government payments for all Medicare services (including the administration of separately-billable drugs and payment for drugs in all Medicare programs) for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, unless a subsequent deficit reduction law was passed before January 2012. As no additional deficit reduction law was enacted by January 2012, the payment reduction (or sequestration) will likely start in January 2013 and continue until December 2021, subject to administrative implementation of the Budget Control Act or future statutory revision. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from U.S. government programs as a result of the sequestration or from other changes designed to achieve similar federal budget savings could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Reimbursement Outside the United States Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems have traditionally been the primary payers of all healthcare costs, including payment for drugs and biologicals. Over the past several years, the reimbursement environment in Europe has become very challenging, including as a result of the proliferation of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations (e.g., National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK) that make recommendations and/or determinations of coverage and reimbursement based on both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product. Although the methods employed by different HTA agencies vary from country to country, the use of formal economic metrics has been increasing across Europe as well as in several emerging markets throughout the world. In addition to determining whether or not a new product will be reimbursed, these agencies are becoming increasingly involved in setting the maximum price at which the product will be reimbursed  the value-based price for a product. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. In some countries, international price referencing is the primary mechanism for price control whereby the ceiling price of a pharmaceutical or biological product is set based on the prices in particular benchmark countries. These price referencing rules are increasing in complexity as payers seek lower-price benchmarks against which to compare themselves. Trends across Europe are also leading toward increased price transparency, with the development of databases to include prices across Europe and requests from specific national payers to provide commercially confidential net price information. Additional cost-containment measures can include therapeutic reference pricing (e.g., setting the reimbursement rate for a given class of agents at the lowest price within the class), increasing mandates or incentives for generic substitution and government-mandated price cuts. In addition, healthcare reform in France, Germany and Spain, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Greece, Italy and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. Other countries may follow and/or take similar or more extensive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics, including implementing mandatory price reductions, initiating clawbacks of payments made to companies when national hospital drug spending thresholds are exceeded, establishing preferences for biosimilar products, or reducing the amount of reimbursement. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to reward new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies.   In many countries, the influence of regional and hospital payers also contributes to whether patients have access to certain products. For example, a product may be successfully listed on a national formulary, but may also be subject to further evaluations or competitive bidding by payers at a regional or hospital level. The impact of multiple layers of assessment can result in delay or failure to secure access and/or net price pressure. Payers in some countries are using and others are beginning to experiment with alternative payment mechanisms (e.g., payment caps, risk sharing) as a means to maintain access to innovative therapies while increasing their budget certainty. Requirements for such payment mechanisms can impact Amgens business through increased net price concessions and added administrative burden. Fraud and Abuse Regulations Related to Reimbursement As participants in government reimbursement programs, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. (See Government Regulation  Other . ) Violations of fraud and abuse laws can result in stringent enforcement penalties up to and including complete exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and/or cell culture, processes by which our proteins are produced, and also includes purification of the proteins to a high quality. The proteins are then formulated into a stable form. The fill process dispenses the formulated bulk protein into vials or syringes. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution. We operate a number of commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities, and our primary facilities are located in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) We also use and expect to continue to use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of certain of our large molecule marketed products as well as a number of our clinical product candidates. Manufacturing of Sensipar  /Mimpara  , our small molecule product, is currently performed by third-party contract manufacturers, except for certain finish activities performed by us in Puerto Rico. The global supply of our products depends on actively managing the inventory produced at our facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers and the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. During the manufacturing scale-up process, and even after achieving sustainable commercial manufacturing, we may encounter difficulties or disruptions due to defects in raw materials or equipment, contamination or other factors that could impact product availability. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales and  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.) Commercial Bulk Manufacturing We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in several locations throughout the United States. (See Item 2. Properties.) We perform commercial bulk manufacturing for our proteins except Vectibix  , which is performed by a third-party contract manufacturer. We also supplement commercial bulk manufacturing for ENBREL, Prolia  and XGEVA  with a third-party contract manufacturer. Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish Manufacturing We perform most of our commercial protein formulation, fill and finish manufacturing in our Puerto Rico facility. Formulation, fill and finish manufacturing for Nplate  and Vectibix  is performed by third-party  contract manufacturers. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico, fill and finish of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by third-party contract manufacturers. We also conduct certain finish activities in the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) Clinical Manufacturing Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California location. (See Item 2. Properties.) Clinical bulk and fill manufacturing activities for our clinical product candidate, talimogene laherparepvec, are performed at our Woburn, Massachusetts facility. Certain finish activities for our clinical products are also performed in the Netherlands. In addition, we also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain of our clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United States, principally in Kentucky and California, and in the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. In addition, we also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our commercial and clinical products in certain areas of the world. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands perform key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, distribution and production scheduling. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. (See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . ) Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to optimize our manufacturing network and/or mitigate risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our commercial products. The facilities impacted by each of these initiatives will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authorities. These initiatives include: ##TABLE_START    Construction of a new formulation and fill facility at our Puerto Rico site; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Expansion of our bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Modification and expansion of our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish site in Ireland; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Expansion of our Colorado and Rhode Island facilities to enable manufacturing of certain clinical products as well as to provide alternative bulk manufacturing sources for certain marketed products. ##TABLE_END In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, further optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials necessary for the commercial and clinical bulk manufacturing of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only source for such materials. Also,  certain medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be the sole source. Certain of the raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from the specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. Certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.) We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development. We must conduct extensive clinical trials designed to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates in order to file for regulatory approval to market a product. Product development and approval within that regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval we obtain remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions. In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct  clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing is substantial and may vary by product. For example, the clinical trials for the BLA for Prolia  /XGEVA  were large and required substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. Foreign studies performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to good clinical practice. Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may not be able to develop commercial products.) The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Applications . The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products subject to the Public Health Service Act or an NDA for drugs subject to the approval provisions of the FDCA. The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDAs review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Post-approval Phase. After we have obtained approval to market our products, we monitor adverse events from the use of our products and report such events to regulatory agencies, along with information from post marketing surveillance or studies. We may utilize other research approaches to learn or confirm information about our marketed products, including observational studies and patient registries, and may engage in risk management activities such as physician education initiatives and patient advocacy group initiatives. We may also conduct, or be required by regulatory agencies to conduct, further clinical trials to provide additional information on our marketed products safety and efficacy. Those additional trials may include studying different doses or schedules of administration that were used in previous studies, use in other patient populations or other stages of the disease or use over a longer period of time. Additional trials of this nature are sometimes required by regulatory agencies as a condition of their approval to market our products and they might also request or require that we conduct specific studies, including observational epidemiological studies, in order to identify or assess possible safety risks of our marketed products that are observed or suggested by available scientific data and such trials are sometimes referred to as PMCs or PMRs. In the United States, under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA), if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, it may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk. If we are required to conduct such a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which our products have already been approved and to the reimbursement provided by government and commercial payers for our products. The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require companies to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. While risk management activities and programs are not new, with FDAAA the FDA gained new authority to implement specific risk management requirements and new enforcement power to ensure that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA began to implement REMS in 2008. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. In determining whether a product will require a REMS before the product is approved, the FDA may consider a number of factors including: ##TABLE_START    estimated size of the population likely to use the product; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    seriousness of the condition treated and expected benefits of the product; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    duration of treatment with the product; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    seriousness of known or potential adverse events associated with the product; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    whether the product is a new molecular entity. ##TABLE_END All REMS are required to have a timetable for assessment and may have one or more of the following: ##TABLE_START    distribution of a medication guide or a patient package insert to patients; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    communication plan for the healthcare provider or institution, such as a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    elements to assure safe use including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     specific training, experience or certification for prescribers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     certification of medication dispensing sites and dispensing in limited settings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     monitoring of specific patients; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     enrollment of patients in a registry. ##TABLE_END Each REMS is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. Failure to comply with a REMS, including submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  and Nplate  . As REMS are relatively new, the FDA and sponsor companies continue to learn how best to implement, operate and monitor the effectiveness of REMS, and the requirements of our REMS and those of other companies may change over time. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. The FDA also uses various advisory committees of external experts to assist in its mission to protect and promote the public health, to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. The committees are generally advisory only and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by their recommendations. We have participated in meetings of the ODAC, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drug Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs, among others, to address certain issues related to our products, including Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  . FDA Approval of Biosimilar Products . The U.S. healthcare reform law authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a separate, abbreviated pathway. The new law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The new law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. On February 9, 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products. While FDA guidance documents are not legally binding on the public or on the FDA, they indicate the FDAs views on a subject. The draft guidance documents provide insight to the FDAs current thinking on the development of biosimilar products and address a range of technical, scientific and regulatory issues. The guidance documents generally provide that, for approval, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product already licensed by the FDA. In assessing biosimilarity, the FDA indicated that it intends to use a risk-based totality of the evidence approach to evaluate all available data submitted by the applicant. Generally, a  biosimilar application must include a clinical study or studies sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more indications for which the reference product is licensed and the biosimilar applicant seeks approval. The scope and magnitude of clinical data needed will depend on the extent of uncertainty about the biosimilarity of the product as well as the frequency and severity of safety risks associated with the reference product. The FDA indicated that it is still evaluating a number of relevant issues, including criteria for interchangeability (which FDA indicated would be higher standard than biosimilarity). The FDA will accept public comments on the guidance documents for 60 days, following which it may issue final guidance. The FDA has also stated publicly that it intends to hold a follow-up public meeting in the near future to obtain feedback on what additional clarification on the biosimilars approval process is needed. FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of products. We are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing or promoting a product as a treatment for a particular indication. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including suspension of our manufacturing operations. Such issues may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review. Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the United States. In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) who conducts a thorough evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. In the EU, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be similar. In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. After evaluation and marketing authorization, various parties, including the national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holders share responsibilities for the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems in a process known as pharmacovigilance. Healthcare professionals and patients are also encouraged to  report adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. This process includes the collection of adverse drug reaction reports as part of the follow-up on any side effects of a product, and upon assessment, the authorities can decide to demand that product labels be updated with safety data or warnings, that safety data or warnings be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market. Other . We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government and the states have published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors wherever possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities related to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating those laws or if we entered into a settlement with the government, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of those laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates Our vision is to deliver therapeutics that can make a meaningful difference in patients lives. Therefore, we focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD  that is, we identify targets, and then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. As such, our discovery research programs may yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) or small molecules.  We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. (See Item 2. Properties.) We conduct clinical trial activities using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. In order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These licenses and arrangements generally provide for non-refundable upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Various public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of RD in the biotechnology industry. We face competition in pursuing RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into RD arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms. See Government Regulation  Clinical Development for a discussion of the government regulation over clinical development.

AMG 386 AMG 386 is a peptibody that inhibits the interaction between the endothelial cell-selective Tie2 receptor and its ligands Ang1and Ang2. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2011, we announced that enrollment was suspended in the phase 3 study in recurrent ovarian cancer due to DOXIL  (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) supply issues. We initiated a second phase 3 study in recurrent ovarian cancer in 2011. We initiated a phase 3 study for the treatment of first-line ovarian cancer and plan to initiate other phase 2 studies for the treatment of NSCLC and breast cancer in 2012. Phase 2 studies of AMG 386 for treatment of renal cell carcicoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are ongoing. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  is a recombinant human protein agonist of the erythropoietin receptor. The RED-HF  trial phase 3 study, initiated in 2006, is a large (2,600 subjects planned), global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure. The RED-HF  trial continues to enroll subjects and we anticipate data from the study in 2013. In 2011, we initiated a phase 3 study of Aranesp  for the treatment of low risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Ganitumab (AMG 479) Ganitumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody antagonist of IGF-1 receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2011, we initiated a phase 3 study for the treatment of first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. A phase 2 study for the treatment of small cell lung cancer is ongoing. Motesanib Motesanib is an orally-administered small molecule antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors and stem cell factor receptor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. We are developing this product in collaboration with Takeda and Millennium Pharmaceuticals: The Takeda Oncology Company (Millennium). In March 2011, we along with Takeda and Millennium announced top-line results from the MONET1 pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating motesanib administered in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in 1,090 patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The trial did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.78  1.04, p=0.14). Detailed results were also presented at a medical meeting in May 2011. The parties continue to further analyze the data to explore potential opportunities for additional development in first-line NSCLC. Denosumab Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, rheumatoid arthritis and numerous tumor types across the spectrum of cancer-related bone diseases. Prolia  (denosumab) The phase 3 study evaluating Prolia  patients with male osteoporosis was completed and based on the results we announced on November 21, 2011, an sBLA was filed with the FDA for the indication to increase  bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. We also plan to initiate a phase 3 study of Prolia  for the treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis in 2012. XGEVA  (denosumab) In April 2011, we announced that we plan to file for the treatment of giant cell tumor of the bone. On June 27, 2011, we announced the submission of an sBLA to the FDA to expand the indication for XGEVA  to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer to reduce the risk of developing bone metastases. On February 8, 2012, the FDA convened the ODAC to discuss the sBLA filing. The ODAC panel voted 12 to 1 that the overall magnitude of benefit demonstrated with early treatment with XGEVA  to delay bone metastases was not sufficient to conclude a positive risk-benefit ratio in the absence of additional measures impacting quality of life or other disease outcomes. The FDA has targeted a PDUFA action date of April 26, 2012. A phase 3 study for the delay or prevention of bone metastases in patients with adjuvant breast cancer is ongoing. We are planning an additional phase 3 SRE study in patients with multiple myeloma. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  /Mimpara  is an orally-administered small molecule that lowers PTH levels in blood by signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid tissue to inhibit PTH secretion. It also lowers blood calcium and phosphorous levels. The phase 3 E.V.O.L.V.E trial, initiated in 2006, is a large (3,800 patient), multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects of Sensipar  /Mimpara  on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. The E.V.O.L.V.E study completed enrollment in January 2008 and we anticipate data from the study in 2012. Sensipar  /Mimpara  is also being evaluated in post renal transplant patients. Talimogene laherparepvec (formerly known as OncoVEX GM-CSF ) Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from HSV-1. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. On March 4, 2011, we acquired BioVex, a privately held biotechnology company developing treatments for cancer and the prevention of infectious disease, including talimogene laherparepvec, then in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer. On July 29, 2011, we announced our decision to terminate the phase 3 trial in patients with head and neck cancer. The phase 3 study for the treatment of malignant melanoma is ongoing. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is a monoclonal antibody antagonist of the EGFr pathway. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of all of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers may regulate prices, reimbursement levels and/or access to our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. We rely in large part on the reimbursement of our principal products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in foreign countries and a reduction in the coverage and/or reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, there is an increased focus by the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law in the United States in August 2011, mandated a two percent reduction in government payments for all Medicare services (including the administration of separately-billable drugs and payment for drugs in all Medicare programs) for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, unless a subsequent deficit reduction law was passed before January 2012. As no additional deficit reduction law was enacted by January 2012, the payment sequestration will likely start in January 2013 and continue until December 2021. The sequestration remains subject to administrative implementation of the Budget Control Act or future statutory revision by Congress, who could block, limit or otherwise modify the automatic spending cuts. Several alternative deficit reduction proposals have been put forth by President Obama and/or Congressional committees, including proposals designed to further limit federal healthcare expenditures. While we cannot predict whether any deficit reduction actions will be approved by Congress and/or whether a budget sequestration will ultimately occur for Medicare services, a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from U.S. government programs as a result of changes such as those that have been proposed or from other changes designed to achieve similar federal budget savings could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. In March 2010 the United States adopted significant healthcare reform through the enactment of the PPACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement  U.S. Healthcare Reform.) A major goal of the healthcare reform law is to provide greater access to healthcare coverage for more Americans. Accordingly, the healthcare reform law requires individual U.S. citizens and legal residents to maintain qualifying health coverage, imposes certain requirements on employers with respect to offering health coverage to employees, amends insurance regulations regarding when coverage can be provided and denied to individuals, and expands existing government healthcare coverage programs to more individuals in more situations, with most of these changes going into effect by January 2014. We do not expect a significant increase in sales of our products as a result of the 2014 expansions in healthcare coverage. While we cannot fully predict the ultimate impact the healthcare reform law will have on us, or how the law may change due to statutory revision or judicial review, we expect that the new law will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Public and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on  reimbursement under Medicare Part B coverage. Any deterioration in the timeliness or certainty of payment by Medicare to physicians, including as a result of changes in policy or regulations, or as a result of operational difficulties, could negatively impact the willingness of physicians to prescribe our products for patients relying on Medicare for their medical coverage. Most of our products furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in both a physician office setting and hospital outpatient setting are reimbursed under the Medicare Part B ASP payment methodology. (See Item1. Business  Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products.) ASP-based reimbursements of products under Medicare may be below or could fall below the cost that some medical providers pay for such products, which could materially and adversely affect sales of our products. We also face certain risks relating to the calculation of ASP. ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. However, the statute, regulations and CMS guidance do not define specific methodologies for all aspects of the calculation of ASP. For example, in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule for 2012, CMS did not address a proposed methodology for treatment of bundled price concessions. Consequently, the current CMS guidance is that manufacturers may make reasonable assumptions in their calculation of ASP consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute, federal regulations and their customary business practices. As a result, we are required to apply our judgment in certain aspects of calculating ASP which are disclosed to CMS and also are subject to further CMS review. If our calculation of ASP is incorrect, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Additionally, we are required to pay rebates to the federal government on products reimbursed by Medicaid at a rate of 23.1% of the AMP of a product, or if it is greater, the difference between the AMP and the best price available to any non-government customer. The PPACA changed the definition of AMP, and in January 2012 CMS issued a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is final, we will be required to apply our reasonable judgment in certain aspects of the AMP calculation. Once this CMS rule has been finalized, we will have to determine whether our interpretation of AMP follows the rule or if our calculations will need to be amended and this could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Other initiatives reviewing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement rates. For example, in July 2007, CMS issued an NCD where it determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. Generally, an NCD is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage or reimbursement for a specific medical item or service. We believe the restrictions in the 2007 NCD changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy in the oncology setting. As a result, we believe these restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , which in turn had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The reimbursement of ESAs in the nephrology setting has also been reviewed by CMS. On June 16, 2010, CMS opened an NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Following further analysis, on June 16, 2011, CMS issued a FDM in which it determined that it would not issue an NCD at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD, and that it would instead monitor the use of ESAs through the ESRD bundled payment system and its other policy avenues. In the absence of an NCD, Medicare determinations are made by the eleven regional MACs, one of which has already issued a final LCD relating to anemia in patients with CKD not on dialysis, and two more MACs have issued draft LCDs in this setting. All three final or draft LCDs would restrict reimbursement of ESAs to use in accordance with the revised FDA label. Other MACs could also issue LCDs that similarly or further restrict reimbursement for ESAs in this setting, and physician behavior may change to be consistent with the revised label even before formal LCDs are implemented, all of which could have a further material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp  . Additionally, CMS could still propose an NCD and/or further review or change the reimbursement of ESAs in the nephrology setting at some point in the future. CMS has also previously identified a list of potential future NCDs that includes the category of thrombopoiesis stimulating agents (platelet growth factors), the category of drugs that includes Nplate  , and a discussion on bisphosphonates used to treat osteoporosis. CMS has not announced whether it will proceed with an NCA related to thrombopoiesis stimulating agents and, while  Prolia  and XGEVA  are not bisphosphonates, there is the possibility that CMS might evaluate other agents, including RANK Ligand inhibitors such as Prolia  and XGEVA  . In the dialysis setting, the reimbursement rates for our products are also subject to downward pressure. In the United States, dialysis providers are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by the federal government through Medicares ESRD Program. (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Dialysis Reimbursement.) Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers at ASP+6%, using the same ASP payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMSs bundled payment system went into effect for dialysis providers which provides a single payment for all dialysis services including drugs, supplies, and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. On November 1, 2011, following our June 2011 announcement of changes to the labels for the use of ESAs in patients with CKD (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products  ESAs), CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP. The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond one of the QIPs measures which tracks the percent of a providers Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL. (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Dialysis Reimbursement.) CMS indicated that removal of this quality measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. We believe that the implementation of these various changes in the dialysis setting has resulted and may continue to result in a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN  and on our business and results of operations. The government-sponsored healthcare systems in Europe and many other foreign countries are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including payment for drugs and biologics, in those regions. Mandatory price reductions continue to be a significant aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries outside of the United States. Healthcare reform in France, Germany and Spain, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Italy, Greece and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, clawbacks of payments made to companies when national hospital drug spending thresholds are exceeded, preferences for biosimilar products, changes in international price referencing and transparency to achieve prices similar to that in lower-priced countries, and reductions in the amount of reimbursement. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to reward new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The proliferation of HTA organizations (e.g., NICE in the UK) has led to determinations of coverage and reimbursement based on both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product; these agencies are also increasingly setting the maximum price at which products will be reimbursed. While we cannot fully predict the extent of further price reductions and/or reimbursement restrictions taken by governmental payers outside of the United States or the impact such actions will have on our business, such reductions in price and/or the coverage and reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operation. Additional initiatives addressing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement, which could negatively affect sales of our products. If, for any of these or other reasons, reimbursement rates are reduced, or if healthcare providers anticipate reimbursement being reduced, providers may narrow the circumstances in which they prescribe or administer our products, which could reduce the use and/or sales of our products. A reduction in the use and sales of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can  manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. For example, the 2007 creation of the FDAAA significantly added to the FDAs authority, allowing the FDA to (i) require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies; (ii) mandate labeling changes to products and (iii) require sponsors to implement a REMS for a product. Failure to comply with FDAAA requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased product liability risk. Current policy discussions underway in the United States include debates about the implementation of the new, abbreviated pathway for biosimilars established under the healthcare reform law; renegotiation of the PDUFA, which governs the user fees pharmaceutical and biological companies pay to the FDA that provide a substantial portion of the FDAs operating budget, in anticipation of re-authorization before September 30, 2012; and reforms to the regulations that govern diagnostics and medical devices which are sometimes used in conjunction with our products. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. For example, in October 2009 we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA for the BLA for Prolia  in the treatment and prevention of PMO and in the treatment and prevention of bone loss due to hormone ablation therapy (HALT) in breast and prostate cancer patients. The Complete Response Letter related to the PMO indication requested several items, including further information on the design and background adverse event rates to inform the methodology of our previously submitted post-marketing surveillance program. The FDA also requested a new clinical program to support the approval of Prolia  for the prevention of PMO, updated safety data and stated that a REMS is necessary for Prolia  . The Complete Response Letter related to the HALT indication requested additional information regarding the safety of Prolia  in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy and patients with prostate cancer receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy. The FDA specifically requested results from additional adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating that Prolia  has no detrimental effects on either time to disease progression or overall survival. Following the submission of further information, including clinical trial data from a number of trials evaluating denosumab in various oncology indications, in September 2011 the FDA approved Prolia  as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, there may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. Vectibix  , for example, received accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the EU, with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix  as a therapy in treating mCRC. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products  Other Marketed Products  Vectibix  (panitumumab).) If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products accelerated or conditional approval, we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Following recent FDA and FDA advisory committee discussions and actions with respect to other therapeutic oncology products previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA, questions remain about regulatory authorities views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. A number of our products and product candidates have  used endpoints other than overall survival, such as progression-free survival and bone-metastasis-free survival (BMFS), in the clinical trial data submitted for agency review or in clinical trials now being conducted. The use of endpoints such as progression-free survival or BMFS, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. For example, our pivotal phase 3 Study 147 evaluated XGEVA  for its ability to improve BMFS in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has not yet spread to bone. On February 8, 2012, the FDA convened the ODAC to discuss our sBLA filing for XGEVA  to delay bone metastases in prostate cancer and the data from Study 147 submitted to support the filing. During its presentation to the ODAC, the FDA questioned the magnitude of the improvement in BMFS demonstrated in Study 147, and indicated that a further clinical trial might help address some of the remaining unresolved questions regarding the clinical significance of the benefit achieved by XGEVA  in this setting. The ODAC panel concluded that the magnitude of benefit demonstrated with early treatment with XGEVA  to delay bone metastases was not sufficient to conclude a positive risk-benefit ratio for XGEVA  in the absence of additional measures impacting quality of life or other disease outcomes. Further, some of our products or product candidates may be used with a companion diagnostic product, such as a test kit, or companion device, such as an injector or other delivery system. These product candidates or expanded indications of our products may not be approved if the companion diagnostic product or companion device does not gain or maintain regulatory approval. These companion diagnostics and devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies in conducting the studies required for such approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. Delays in the studies or failure of the third-party company to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or device could negatively impact the approval of our product candidate or the expanded indication of our product and we may incur increased development costs, delays in regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. In addition to the clinical trials that we choose to or are required to conduct, other organizations may also conduct clinical trials that use our products. Such clinical trials may evaluate our products in areas in which we do not have and are not seeking an approved indication. However, negative results or safety signals arising in other organizations clinical trials may nonetheless prompt regulatory agencies to take regulatory actions that affect our approved indications, including requiring the addition of relevant safety data to the approved labeling or even withdrawing approval for our products. The occurrence of a number of high profile safety events has caused an increased public and governmental concern about potential safety issues relating to pharmaceutical and biological products and certain of our products and product candidates. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) As a result of this increased concern in recent years, the U.S. regulatory environment has evolved and safety signals and safety concerns resulting from pre-clinical data, clinical trials (including sub-analyses and meta-analyses), market use or other sources are receiving greater scrutiny. For example, a number of regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA and the EMA, have initiated programs to directly monitor for safety issues rather than wait for patients, providers or manufacturers to report safety problems with products or medical devices. And at least one private, for-profit company has begun aggregating and analyzing FDA adverse event data on its website using its own independent methodology, which could highlight new perceived risks of our products and product candidates. Actual or perceived safety problems or signals could lead to revised or restrictive labeling of our approved products or a class of products, potentially including limitations on the use of approved products in certain patients because of: ##TABLE_START    the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns with respect to any of our products by regulatory agencies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    an increased rate or number of previously-identified safety-related events; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related to results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, or meta-analysis (a meta-analysis is the review of studies using various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) of clinical trials or clinical data performed by us or others; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new legislation or rules by regulatory agencies. ##TABLE_END For example, in December 2009, based on the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp  Therapy (TREAT) results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. In October 2010, we submitted additional proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In June 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved further changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , in patients with CKD. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) In addition to revised labeling for our products, discovery of new safety information or previously unknown safety concerns and/or safety signals with our products or similar products could also lead to: ##TABLE_START    requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) or other FDA compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    mandated PMCs/PMRs or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas, and/or; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. ##TABLE_END Product safety concerns could cause regulatory agencies to impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS), which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop, implement and administer. The results of these risk management activities could: ##TABLE_START    impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limit patient access to our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reduce patient willingness to use our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    place administrative burdens on healthcare providers in prescribing our products; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS or similar risk management activities. ##TABLE_END We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  and Nplate  , and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of our REMS that include elements to assure safe use. For example, our ESA REMS requires applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS and providing the FDA with periodic assessment reports to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. If we or third-party service providers acting on our behalf fail to effectively implement and/or administer the REMS for our products, we may be required to modify such REMS, and we may be subject to FDA enforcement actions or to civil penalties.  Further, if new medical data or product quality issues suggest an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may withdraw some or all affected product  either voluntarily or by regulatory mandate  in certain therapeutic areas, or completely recall a product presentation from the market for some period or permanently. For example, in September 2009, we initiated a voluntary recall of a limited number of ENBREL SureClick  lots due to a defect in the glass syringe barrel which resulted in a small number of broken syringes following assembly of the autoinjector device. In October 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of ENBREL due to identification of cracks in a small number of the glass syringes which may have resulted in product leakage and syringe breakage. Further, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN  and JJ voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT  , manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close cooperation with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products, which may materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, if other parties (including our independent clinical trial investigators or our licensees, such as JJ, Pfizer, Glaxo, Takeda and Daiichi Sankyo) report or fail to effectively report to regulatory agencies side effects or other safety concerns that occur from their use of our products in clinical trials or studies or from marketed use, resulting regulatory action could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) As more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generic or biosimilar products, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products which could impact our profitability.) Additionally, as a result of the current global economic downturn, our third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government and/or private payer healthcare programs or increased competition from lower cost biosimilar products could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, the economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and  results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. In Europe, economic conditions across the region could potentially be impacted by countries of key concern like Greece, which is facing possible default of its sovereign debt obligations, and Spain, France and Italy, whose sovereign debt obligations were recently downgraded. Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including drugs and biologics. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. Beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and other agencies. In the United States, the FDA has reviewed and continues to review the benefit-risk profile of ESAs, which has resulted in and could result in future changes to ESA labeling and usage. For example, in August 2008, we revised the labeling for our ESAs as the FDA directed. In addition, in July 2007 CMS issued an NCD for non-renal ESAs that determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions, and established Medicare coverage parameters for FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. Since these labeling and reimbursement changes, we experienced a substantial reduction in our ESA sales, in particular Aranesp sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care setting. U.S. regulators have also reviewed the use of ESAs in the nephrology setting. In October 2009, the results from TREAT, a phase 3 pivotal study of patients with CKD not on dialysis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study failed to meet its primary objectives of demonstrating a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, including heart failure, heart attack, stroke or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, or time to ESRD. On December 16, 2009, based on the TREAT results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. And in June 2011, we announced that the FDA approved further changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , in patients with CKD. Over the past several years, CMS has also reviewed the use of ESAs and has considered and incorporated significant changes in the ways ESAs are reimbursed in the nephrology setting, including the implementation of the ESRD bundled payment system, subsequent changes to  the QIP and consideration of a possible NCD to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Further restrictions are possible as the regional MACs implement LCDs to address Medicare coverage for ESAs in CKD not on dialysis within their respective geographic areas, and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp  . (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) Together, these labeling and reimbursement changes, along with the approved REMS for ESAs, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We do not know what effect, if any, the June 2011 ESA label changes will have on the final version of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO) global anemia clinical practice guidelines which KDIGO has indicated could be available by early 2012. (See Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.) We have also agreed with the FDA to conduct a number of PMCs for our ESAs. In 2004, we agreed with the FDA to a robust pharmacovigilance program to continue to study the safety surrounding the use of darbepoetin alfa in the oncology setting. Of the five studies originally part of that pharmacovigilance program, four are complete, and the results of certain of those studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESAs and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. The remaining study, the LNH03-6B Study, is being conducted by the Groupe dEtudes des Lymphomes de lAdulte, which presented second interim analysis results at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2011, and is currently estimated to be completed in 2012. Other trials have subsequently been initiated to inform on the safety of ESAs. In 2009 we initiated Study 782, a phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo, as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. In addition, JRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study, which evaluates the use of epoetin alfa in patients with breast cancer, is ongoing. Both of these studies are designated by the FDA as PMRs and must be conducted to maintain regulatory approval and marketing authorization. For the nephrology setting, we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding additional PMRs to explore alternative ESA dosing strategies in CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. Although we cannot predict the results or the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, or the extent to which regulatory authorities may require additional labeling changes as a result of these or other trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that unfavorable results from clinical trials, including PMCs, could have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs and on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also reviewed and scrutinized the use of ESAs. In June 2008, the EMA recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients, which was approved by the EC in October 2008. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that, in some clinical situations, blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient. Following the October 2008 revision, we experienced a reduction of Aranesp  sales in the supportive cancer care setting in the EU. In addition, following the June 2011 ESA label changes in the United States, regulatory agencies outside the United States have sought additional information from us about the use and safety of ESAs in the CKD setting. Additional labeling or reimbursement changes by these regulatory authorities could materially and adversely affect the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs, including PMCs. For example, in May 2009, the Cochrane Collaboration published its independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and the EMA. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient-level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion, but they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. In addition, data from the RED-HF  trial evaluating the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure is anticipated in 2012. Unfavorable results from these or similar trials or meta-analyses  of previous clinical trials could materially and adversely affect the use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatorily diverse clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site, not approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis, if at all.  Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators clinical trials which could: ##TABLE_START    delay the clinical trial program; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require additional or longer trials to gain approval; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our drugs or similar products that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use and sales of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, we have initiated Study 782 as part of our Aranesp  oncology pharmacovigilance program. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) In connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilar products, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. In 2010, lawmakers in the United States enacted healthcare reform legislation which included an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. The EU has already created such a regulatory pathway. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2006, the EMA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products, including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, recommending that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct pharmacodynamic, toxicological and clinical safety studies as well as a pharmacovigilance program. In late 2011, the EMA  announced plans to issue in the first half of 2012 final guidelines on the approval process for biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and draft guidelines on the approval process for other biosimilar drugs. Some companies have received and other companies are seeking approval to market erythropoietin and G-CSF biosimilars in the EU, presenting additional competition for our products. (See Our marketed products face substantial competition.) For example, following the expiration of the principal European patent relating to recombinant G-CSF in August 2006, the EC issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilar products and the products were launched in certain EU countries in 2008 and 2009. There are now several G-CSF biosimilars available in the EU marketed by different companies and these G-CSF biosimilar products compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . Further, as in an effort to reduce costs, countries in the EU may in the future permit the automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding innovator products or adopt other biosimilar uptake measures. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilar products or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA which authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar products under a separate, abbreviated pathway. The law established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlined statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting, for a period of 12 years, others from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. On February 9, 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents that provide insight into the FDAs current thinking on the development of biosimilar products and broad parameters for the scientific assessment of biosimilar applications. The documents provide guidance in the development of biosimilar versions of currently approved biological products and indicate that the clinical trials and other steps required for approval of each biosimilar product will depend on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the protein, the sophistication of the manufacturing required and the potential risks of the product. A growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including a number of our products. Further, biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to quickly obtain U.S. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period. President Obamas proposed 2013 budget includes a proposal to lower the data exclusivity period to seven years, but this would require new legislation be passed by Congress. Critics may also encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our products, or the degree to which the FDAs recent guidelines will contribute to that impact, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilar products and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. (See Item 7A. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may not be able to develop commercial products. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant RD investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START    the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined. ##TABLE_END Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) for the treatment of advanced Parkinsons disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The conclusion was reached even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinsons disease patients. Subsequently, we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease. Our marketed products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilar products. These companies may have greater resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, one of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on  our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts, fines, penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Beginning in 2007, we received a number of subpoenas from various government entities, including the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington, as well as the Attorneys General of New York and New Jersey. The federal subpoenas were issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 3486), and by a federal grand jury, while the Attorneys General subpoenas were issued pursuant to state specific statutes relating to consumer fraud laws and state false claims acts. In general, the subpoenas requested documents relating to the sales and marketing of our products, and our collection and dissemination of information reflecting clinical research as to the safety and efficacy of our ESAs. Based on representations in a U.S. government filing that became public in May 2009 relating to the Massachusetts Qui Tam Action (as defined in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements) and subsequent conversations with government prosecutors, we learned that the subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington relate to the Massachusetts Qui Tam Action and nine additional Qui Tam Actions (as defined in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements) pending against us in various federal jurisdictions. In October 2011 we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle to settle the allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices arising out of the ongoing civil and criminal investigations conducted by the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington. The proposed settlement involves numerous state and federal agencies and remains subject to continuing discussions regarding the components of the agreement, and the completion and execution of all required documentation. Until the proposed settlement becomes final, there can be no guarantee that these matters will be resolved by the agreement in principle. If the proposed settlement is not finalized as proposed, we would have to continue to explain and defend our actions to government entities involved, which would be burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for us and could result in criminal charges, civil penalties or other enforcement actions. In addition, while the agreement in principle includes the dismissal of the claims of the government in the Qui Tam Actions, the individual relators in the Qui Tam Actions have the opportunity to join in the proposed settlement or, if they object, to have the settlement evaluated in a federal court fairness hearing to determine whether it is fair, adequate and reasonable under all the circumstances. If the court determines that the settlement is not fair, adequate and reasonable, then we would have the option to continue to defend our actions in court, or to seek to negotiate a new settlement. We have been made aware that we are also a defendant in several other civil qui tam actions that remain under seal in the U.S. federal courts where they were filed. Included with these actions are allegations that our promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities relating to ENBREL and Aranesp  caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. Certain of the allegations in these other actions are not encompassed in the proposed settlement discussed above. In addition, as described in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, this proposed settlement does not cover a number of other litigation matters that will continue to be pending against us.  Throughout these investigations, the government entities are asserting that we violated various state and federal laws. These investigations are very burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for us to explain and defend to these entities. Although we cannot predict whether additional proceedings may be initiated against us, or predict when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time and to require managements attention and significant legal expense. A determination that we are in violation of the various federal and state laws that govern the sales and marketing of our products could result in federal criminal liability and/or federal or state civil or administrative liability, and thus could result in substantial financial damages or criminal penalties and possible exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START    regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components. ##TABLE_END These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or  could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently manufacture all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Nplate  , XGEVA  and Vectibix  and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START    availability or contamination of raw materials, components and equipment used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    contamination by microorganisms or viruses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    degree of compliance with regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in forecasts of future demand; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing and actual number of production runs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    updating of manufacturing specifications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    production success rates and yields; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing and outcome of product quality testing. ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to maintain supply and to satisfy anticipated future demand for denosumab, we are qualifying the expansion of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site. In addition, in order mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and are modifying  and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  and the purification of bulk EPOGEN  material at this facility, and plan to perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA  at the Puerto Rico facility once the facility has been approved by the FDA for that purpose. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including: ##TABLE_START    power failures and/or other utility failures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    improper installation or operation of equipment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA. ##TABLE_END In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such  coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and such losses could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of ENBREL and EPOGEN  voluntarily recalled in 2009 and 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDAs expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. For example, until the Pennsylvania District Court entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Teva on July 15, 2011 pursuant to a joint stipulation and settlement agreement between the parties, Teva had announced that it intended to sell its filgrastim product, upon approval from the FDA, in the United States without a license from us and prior to the expiration of our G-CSF patents. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. (See Item 7A. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) We have received,  and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. For example, while we do not expect biosimilars competition on ENBREL in the United States for the foreseeable future, there are a number of competing therapies currently on the market and more in clinical development that are different from ENBREL but are used to treat the same inflammatory diseases treated by ENBREL. Although we continue to develop new products, and obtain patent protection for these new product candidates, we may not be able to replace the revenue lost upon the expiration of the patents on our current products. From time to time, U.S. and other policymakers have proposed reforming the patent laws and regulations of their countries. In September 2011, after years of Congressional debate regarding patent reform legislation, President Obama signed into law the America Invents Act (the Act) considered by many to be the most substantial revision of U.S. patent law since 1952. The Acts various provisions will go into effect over an 18-month period. The Act changes the current first-to-invent system to a system that awards a patent to the first-inventor-to-file for an application for a patentable invention. This change alters the pool of available materials that can be used to challenge patents and eliminates the ability to rely on prior research work in order to lay claim to patent rights. Disputes as to whether the first filer is in fact the true inventor will be resolved through newly implemented derivation proceedings. The Act also creates mechanisms to allow challenges to newly issued patents in the patent office in post-grant proceedings and new inter partes reexamination proceedings. Although many of the changes bring U.S. law into closer harmony with European and other national patent laws, the new bases and procedures may make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents, which could result in increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The changes may also make it harder to challenge third-party patents and place greater importance on being the first inventor to file a patent application on an invention. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, HTA organizations, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients,  healthcare providers and payers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include: ##TABLE_START    In August 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) distributed to the nephrology community final updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD. The NKF-KDOQI Anemia Work Group recommended in its 2007 Update to the NKF-KDOQI Anemia Management Guidelines that physicians target Hb in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL, and also stipulated that the target not be above 13 g/dL. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In December 2008, the KDIGO, a not-for-profit foundation managed by NKF, announced that it was developing a new global anemia guideline. The announcement stated that an updated anemia guideline is necessary in light of new study results, particularly the data from the TREAT trial, which had become available since the NKF-KDOQIs clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD were released. On September 30, 2011, the KDIGO released its draft global anemia clinical practice guidelines for public review and comment. KDIGO has indicated that final guidelines could be available by early 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In February 2007, following the reported results from our Anemia of Cancer 103 Study, the U.S. Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information Drug Reference Guides removed Aranesp  in the treatment of anemia of cancer. ##TABLE_END In addition, HTA organizations, such as NICE in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business  Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected. Our corporate compliance and risk mitigation programs cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or that we effectively manage all operational risks. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations and/or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Additionally, while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee  that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. If we fail to effectively mitigate all operational risks, our product supply may be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Cost savings initiatives may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred. Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those efforts, we undertake cost savings initiatives to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these cost savings initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress and the Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of international income, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock. On April 20, 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the Company would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, and increased the total authorization for repurchases of our common stock to approximately $7.2 billion. On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the total authorization for repurchases of our common stock by approximately $6.1 billion to $10 billion, and in December 2011 we repurchased approximately $5 billion of our common stock in a modified Dutch auction tender offer, leaving approximately $5 billion remaining for future repurchases under our Board authorization. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for information regarding cash dividends declared per common share. ##TABLE_START (1)  On August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure. Under this plan in 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred restructuring charges of $70 million ($44 million, net of tax), $148 million ($111 million, net of tax) and $739 million ($576 million, net of tax), respectively, related primarily to staff separation costs, asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (primarily in 2007) and loss accruals for leases on certain facilities that will not be used in our business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  As part of the accounting for the business combinations of Alantos Pharmaceutical Holding, Inc. and Ilypsa, Inc. in 2007, under the then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write-off acquired in-process RD (IPRD) of $270 million and $320 million, respectively. The charges represent the estimated fair values of the IPRD that, as of the respective acquisition dates, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  In 2011, we recorded a $780 million legal settlement charge ($705 million, net of tax) in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. In 2008, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech Products L.P. (Ortho Biotech) antitrust suit. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (4)  Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash. As required by this standard, we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt. Under this method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately. The equity components of our convertible notes are included in Common stock and additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification, as applicable. The reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non-cash interest expense. This results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. Included in net income for 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is the incremental non-cash interest expense of $143 million ($91 million, net of tax), $266 million ($168 million, net of tax), $250 million ($155 million, net of tax), $235 million ($144 million, net of tax) and $168 million ($88 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5)  See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our financing arrangements. In addition, in 2008 and 2007 we issued $1.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, aggregate principal amount of notes. In 2008, we repaid our $2.0 billion of floating rate notes. In 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding zero-coupon 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their put option, we repurchased the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes, at their then-accreted value of $1.7 billion. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6)  Throughout the five years ended December 31, 2011, we had a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors through which we repurchased $8.3 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of Amgen common stock. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "7": " Item 7.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We are the worlds largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment  human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation and nephrology. Our principal products include Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business  Marketed Products. In 2011, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving record U.S. and international product sales of $11.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We also paid our first ever dividends, aggregating $500 million paid in 2011. In December 2011, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock payable in March 2012, representing a 29% increase over prior quarters. Additionally, in 2011, we repurchased approximately 15% of our stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010, for a total cost of $8.3 billion. Of this amount, $5 billion was purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer following an increase in our authorized stock repurchase program to $10 billion and our announcement that we intended to accelerate our repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. We issued $7.5 billion of debt, in part to fund the purchase of stock related to the tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. We enter 2012 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA  and Prolia  represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receiving regulatory and/or reimbursement approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications  for these products may provide further opportunities for growth. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, by the successful development of our later stage pipeline and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of BioVex, Bergamo and our recently announced agreement to acquire Micromet. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies, along with the significant savings that we will realize upon the expiration of our ENBREL co-promotion agreement with Pfizer in the fourth quarter of 2013, may assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure, including in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In the United States, ENBREL will also continue to face increasing competition and our ESAs may begin facing competition in the near term. Additionally, over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We also believe our products and product candidates will continue to face regulatory and reimbursement challenges. In addition, the current global economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increased pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Certain of the above challenges may have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and liquidity. However, these effects may be offset by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, as discussed above. Selected financial information The following provides an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010  Product sales:    U.S.  $ 11,725    4 %   $ 11,254  International   3,570    5 %    3,406       Total product sales   15,295    4 %    14,660  Other revenues   287    (27)%    393       Total revenues  $ 15,582    4 %   $ 15,053       Operating expenses  $ 11,270    19 %   $ 9,508  Operating income  $ 4,312    (22)%   $ 5,545  Net income  $ 3,683    (20)%   $ 4,627  Diluted EPS  $ 4.04    (16)%   $ 4.79  Diluted shares   912    (5)%    965  ##TABLE_END When discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2011 reflects overall growth for all marketed products except ESAs, which declined 17%. Excluding sales of ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 14%, driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. International product sales for 2011 were negatively impacted by a decline in sales of Aranesp  of 5%. Excluding Aranesp  sales, international product sales grew 11%. The decrease in other revenues for 2011 was due principally to certain milestone payments earned in 2010. The increase in operating expenses for 2011 was driven primarily by a legal settlement charge and higher SGA expenses. The decrease in diluted EPS for 2011 was due to the reduction in net income, attributable primarily to lower operating income. This decrease in diluted EPS was offset partially by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS.  Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the euro. Our results of operations for 2011 were impacted by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax, for 2011 cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12. As of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $20.6 billion, and total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   $ 5,212    8 %   $ 4,844    4 %   $ 4,643  ENBREL   3,701    5 %    3,534    1 %    3,493  Aranesp    2,303    (7)%    2,486    (6)%    2,652  EPOGEN    2,040    (19)%    2,524    (2)%    2,569  Other products   2,039    60 %    1,272    28 %    994          Total product sales  $ 15,295    4 %   $ 14,660    2 %   $ 14,351          Total U.S.  $ 11,725    4 %   $ 11,254    1 %   $ 11,135  Total International   3,570    5 %    3,406    6 %    3,216          Total product sales  $ 15,295    4 %   $ 14,660    2 %   $ 14,351          ##TABLE_END Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including, but not necessarily limited to: ##TABLE_START    our contracting and pricing strategies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     legislative reform in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START     cost containment pressures; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    clinical trial outcomes, including adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    competitive products, including biosimilars; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    physician and patient compliance with product dosing regimens; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in clinical practice, including those resulting from the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adoption of and adherence to risk management activities, such as a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    patient population growth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    segment growth and penetration; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product launches and indications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expansion into new international markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adequacy of product supply and distribution; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including those conducted under collaboration agreements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    concentration of customer purchasing power; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    acquisitions and divestures. ##TABLE_END Our U.S. product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., holiday-driven wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. In addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.  Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  Neulasta   U.S.  $ 3,006    13 %   $ 2,654    5 %   $ 2,527  NEUPOGEN   U.S.   959    3 %    932    3 %    901          Total U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN    3,965    11 %    3,586    5 %    3,428          Neulasta   International   946    5 %    904    9 %    828  NEUPOGEN   International   301    (15)%    354    (9)%    387          Total International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN    1,247    (1)%    1,258    4 %    1,215          Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   $ 5,212    8 %   $ 4,844    4 %   $ 4,643          ##TABLE_END The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  for 2011 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and Neulasta  unit growth. The decrease in Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  international sales was driven by a decline in NEUPOGEN  sales due, in part, to biosimilar competition, offset partially by an increase in Neulasta  sales due, in part, to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  . The increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  for 2010 was driven principally by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The increase in international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for 2010 reflects primarily growth in Neulasta  , principally from the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN  , offset partially by a decline in NEUPOGEN  sales due, in part, to biosimilar competition. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  ENBREL  U.S.  $ 3,458    5 %   $ 3,304    1 %   $ 3,283  ENBREL  Canada   243    6 %    230    10 %    210          Total ENBREL  $ 3,701    5 %   $ 3,534    1 %   $ 3,493          ##TABLE_END The increase in ENBREL sales for 2011 reflects primarily an increase in the average net sales price. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2010 reflects an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a low single-digit percentage point unit decline, resulting primarily from share declines in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales.  Aranesp  Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  Aranesp   U.S.  $ 986    (11)%   $ 1,103    (12)%   $ 1,251  Aranesp   International   1,317    (5)%    1,383    (1)%    1,401          Total Aranesp   $ 2,303    (7)%   $ 2,486    (6)%   $ 2,652          ##TABLE_END The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2011 was due principally to a high-teens percentage point unit decline, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. The unit decline reflects segment contraction resulting from changes to reimbursement in 2011 and the June 2011 ESA label changes. The decrease in international Aranesp  sales for 2011 was due to a decrease in the average net sales price and a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction. The decrease in international Aranesp  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Aranesp  sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes and any other product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reimbursement developments, including LCDs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp  .

EPOGEN  Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  EPOGEN   U.S.  $ 2,040    (19)%   $ 2,524    (2)%   $ 2,569          ##TABLE_END The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in dose utilization related to changes to reimbursement in 2011 and the June 2011 ESA label changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and patient population growth. The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2010 was due primarily to a unit decline and certain changes in accounting estimates. The unit decline reflects a decrease in dose utilization, offset partially by patient population growth. In addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN  sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START    potential peginesatide launch; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     CMSs 2011 Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START     other CMS activities, including recent changes related to the QIP; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory developments, including the June 2011 ESA label changes and any other product label changes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new contracts with dialysis centers; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF. ##TABLE_END Certain of the above factors may have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN  .

Business  Significant Developments, Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales.  Operating expenses Operating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   Change   2010   Change   2009  Operating expenses:      Cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets presented separately)  $ 2,427    9%   $ 2,220    6%   $ 2,091  % of product sales   15.9%     15.1%     14.6%  Research and development  $ 3,167    9%   $ 2,894    1%   $ 2,864  % of product sales   20.7%     19.7%     20.0%  Selling, general and administrative  $ 4,486    13%   $ 3,983    4%   $ 3,820  % of product sales   29.3%     27.2%     26.6%  Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets  $ 294       $ 294       $ 294  Other  $ 896       $ 117       $ 67  ##TABLE_END Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, increased to 15.9% of product sales for 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. This decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies. Cost of sales increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN  , PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party RD arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description Discovery Research and Translational Sciences  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_END  RD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009  Discovery Research and Translational Sciences  $ 1,125   $ 1,154   $ 1,157  Later stage clinical programs   983    832    1,000  Marketed products   1,059    908    707        Total RD expense.  $ 3,167   $ 2,894   $ 2,864        ##TABLE_END The increase in RD expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our continued support for Prolia  and XGEVA  which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia  and XGEVA  as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to RD technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years. The increase in RD expense for 2010 was driven primarily by an increase of $201 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our support for Prolia  and XGEVA  which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs and, to a lesser extent, lower cost recoveries from ongoing collaborations. This increase was offset by a reduction of $168 million in our later stage clinical programs as a result of the aforementioned approvals of Prolia  and XGEVA  , as well as licensing fees paid in 2009, and lower expenses associated with our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $3 million. Certain amounts for 2010 have been reclassified to better conform to the above descriptions of RD activities. Selling, general and administrative SGA expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SGA expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SGA expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. The increase in SGA expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia  and XGEVA  and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million. The increase in SGA expense for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia  and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,288 million, $1,184 million and $1,163 million, respectively. Other In 2011, we recorded a $780 million legal settlement charge in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. In addition in 2011, as part of our continuing efforts to improve cost efficiencies in our operations, we recorded certain charges, primarily severance related, of $109 million. In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009  Interest expense, net  $ 610   $ 604   $ 578  Interest and other income, net  $ 448   $ 376   $ 276  Provisions for income taxes  $ 467   $ 690   $ 599  Effective tax rate   11.3 %   13.0 %   11.5 % ##TABLE_END Interest expense, net Included in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $143 million, $266 million and $250 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. The reduction of non-cash interest expense in 2011 was offset by increased interest expense associated with recent borrowings. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $67 million. The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed over a six year period beginning in 2011 with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015, and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rate for 2011 would have been approximately 18% without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.  The increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that changed the disclosure requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the financial statements, including the elimination of the option to present OCI in the statement of stockholders equity. OCI and its components will be required to be presented for both interim and annual periods either in a single financial statement, the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of a statement of income followed by a separate statement presenting OCI. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively beginning January 1, 2012, except for certain provisions for which adoption was delayed. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  $ 20,641   $ 17,422  Total assets   48,871    43,486  Current portion of long-term debt   84    2,488  Long-term debt   21,344    10,874  Stockholders equity   19,029    23,944  ##TABLE_END The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). In April 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock. Subsequently in October 2011, the Board of Directors increased the total authorization for stock repurchases by $6.1 billion to $10 billion. At that time, we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. During 2011, we repurchased 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. In April 2011, the Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. Additionally in December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, payable in March 2012.  We believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent upon the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, customers outside the United States, which include government owned or supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, upon the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes to collect payments, particularly in certain regions within these countries. However, the timing of payments from government healthcare providers has not nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. To date we have not incurred any significant losses on collections of trade receivables from these government healthcare providers. Over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar, but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record. As discussed above, we have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA  and Prolia  and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products patent expiries. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011, were $84 million and $21.3 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2010, were $2.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.  We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2011, including: ##TABLE_START   In 2011, we issued $10.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 1.875% 2014 Notes, the 2.30% 2016 Notes, the 2.50% 2016 Notes, the 4.375% 2018 euro Notes (550 million aggregate principal amount), the 4.10% 2021 Notes, the 3.875% 2021 Notes, the 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes (475 million aggregate principal amount), the 5.15% 2041 Notes and the 5.65% 2042 Notes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In 2010, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 4.50% 2020 Notes, the 3.45% 2020 Notes, the 5.75% 2040 Notes and the 4.95% 2041 Notes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 5.70% 2019 Notes and the 6.40% 2039 Notes. ##TABLE_END In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010, and we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% in 2009. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term notes issued in 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts. These cross currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest payments in pounds sterling at a fixed rate of 5.5% on 475 million and pay interest in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5.8% on $748 million, the aggregate notional amounts paid to/received from the counterparties upon exchange of currencies at the inception of these contracts. We will pay U.S. dollars to and receive pounds sterling from the counterparties at the maturity of the contracts for the same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged notes, effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on these notes from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. We would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In connection with the new revolving credit agreement we terminated our prior $2.3 billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in November 2012. In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014.  In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2011. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009  Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 5,119   $ 5,787   $ 6,336  Net cash used in investing activities   (786 )   (4,152 )   (3,202 ) Net cash used in financing activities   (674 )   (1,232 )   (2,024 ) ##TABLE_END Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the 2011 due primarily to: increased interest payments; working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia  and XGEVA  ; and the prepayment of certain royalties. The reduction in net income during 2011 was driven primarily by the accrual of the legal settlement charge of $780 million, which will be paid in a subsequent period. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. Investing Capital expenditures totaled $567 million, $580 million and $530 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses totaling $701 million. Net proceeds from marketable securities were $437 million for 2011, compared to net purchases of marketable securities of $3.5 billion for 2010 and $2.7 billion for 2009. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011, in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 was due to repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and repayment of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion.  See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period       Year   Years   Years   Years  Contractual obligations  Total   1   2 and 3   4 and 5   6 and beyond  Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3)  $ 37,521   $ 888   $ 6,131   $ 3,396   $ 27,106  Operating lease obligations   774    116    189    141    328  Purchase obligations (4)   2,992    865    420    243    1,464  Unrecognized tax benefits (5)                               Total contractual obligations  $ 41,287   $ 1,869   $ 6,740   $ 3,780   $ 28,898            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts also include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2011, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net reduction in future interest payments of $366 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term debt issued in December 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest and principal payments and on this debt. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross currency swap contracts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) The long-term debt obligations amounts include the repayment of principal on our euro denominated foreign currency debt at the foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2011. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (5)  Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $912 million at December 31, 2011, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.6 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales deductions and returns Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Rebates   Chargebacks   Other deductions   Total  Balance as of January 1, 2009  $ 653   $ 84   $ 139   $ 876  Amounts charged against product sales   1,663    2,424    552    4,639  Payments   (1,609 )   (2,380 )   (556 )   (4,545 )         Balance as of December 31, 2009   707    128    135    970  Amounts charged against product sales   1,861    2,593    580    5,034  Payments   (1,724 )   (2,548 )   (588 )   (4,860 )         Balance as of December 31, 2010   844    173    127    1,144  Amounts charged against product sales   1,795    2,626    670    5,091  Payments   (1,592 )   (2,600 )   (717 )   (4,909 )         Balance as of December 31, 2011  $ 1,047   $ 199   $ 80   $ 1,326          ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total sales deductions were 25%, 25% and 24% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 2% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for the three year ended December 31, 2011.  In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and greater than one year for certain recent government programs. Rebates totaled $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011. A 5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2011 would have had an impact of approximately $90 million, or approximately one-half of 1% of our 2011 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.  We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Companys tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Companys pre-tax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Companys operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Companys foreign income associated with the Companys operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.) Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START   determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed income instruments led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2011. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments continued to decline due to a combination of the Federal Reserves monetary policies and the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequently assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale debt security investments at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; mortgage- and  asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and additionally at December 31, 2010, other short-term interest bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was $20.0 billion and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $21.4 billion and a fair value of $23.0 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $13.4 billion and a fair value of $14.5 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap and cross currency swap contracts. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts, which qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010. These derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, would have resulted in a reduction fair value of approximately $200 million on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2011, we had open cross currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $748 million that hedge the entire principal amount of our pound sterling denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert payments on this debt to U.S. dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in approximately a $130 million reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts on this date but would not have a material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value and fair value of $1.5 billion that was denominated in pounds sterling and euros. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have  resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $290 million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign exchange would have on the related cross currency swap contracts. With regard to our cross currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our pound sterling denominated debt, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $210 million on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which would equal the entire change in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, would be approximately $150 million. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2011, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.5 billion and $292 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.2 billion and $398 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $670 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $389 million and $670 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2010, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of approximately $130 million and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by  requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011. Management determined that, as of December 31, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 29, 2012  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDOverview Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. Our medicines help millions of patients in the fight against cancer, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), bone disease, and other serious illnesses. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. We were incorporated in 1980 and organized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. Our public website is www.amgen.com. On our website, investors can find press releases, financial filings and other information about the Company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, www.sec.gov, also offers access to reports and documents we have electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. Our principal products are Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), a pegylated protein, based on the Filgrastim molecule, and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), both of which stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection); Enbrel  (etanercept), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a substance that plays a role in inflammatory diseases; Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) and EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that stimulate the production of red blood cells; and XGEVA  /Prolia  (denosumab), two products that contain the same active ingredient but which are approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets RANKL, an essential regulator of osteoclasts (the cells that break down bone). Our principal products represented 89%, 90% and 92% of our sales in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our other marketed products include primarily Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet), a small molecule calcimimetic that lowers serum calcium levels; Vectibix  (panitumumab), a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr); and Nplate  (romiplostim), a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that mimics endogenous TPO, the primary driver of platelet production. We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States, Europe and Canada. We have also entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization and marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Business Relationships . ) Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition to our marketed products, we have various product candidates in mid- to late-stage development in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. Our research and development (RD) organization has expertise in multiple treatment modalities, including large molecules (such as proteins, antibodies and peptibodies) and small molecules. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities for all of our principal products as well as most of our product candidates. We operate a number of commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities, and our primary manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. See Item 2. Properties. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are very long  approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Upon approval, marketed products in our industry generally face substantial competition. Our industry is highly regulated, and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business. Government authorities in the United States and other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products as well as our ongoing RD activities. In recent years, regulators have placed a greater scrutiny on drug safety. This has led to, and may in the future lead to: fewer products being approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory bodies; delays in receiving approvals; additional safety-related requirements; restrictions on the use of products, including expanded safety labeling, or required risk management activities. Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments that occurred in 2012 affecting our business. Products/Pipeline AMG 145  ##TABLE_START  In November 2012, we presented data from four phase 2 studies evaluating AMG 145 as monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in statin-intolerant subjects. In each of these studies, treatment with AMG 145 resulted in statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to the control arms at 12 weeks. Based on the study results, phase 3 enrollment is underway in these populations. ##TABLE_END Sensipar  /Mimpara   ##TABLE_START  In November 2012, we presented at American Society of Nephrology's (ASN) Kidney Week the results of the phase 3 E.V.O.L.V.E  (EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) trial. As previously reported, the primary analysis showed that the trial did not reach its primary endpoint (time to composite event comprising all-cause mortality or first non-fatal cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure or peripheral vascular event) in the intent-to-treat analysis. See Significant Developments in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012. ##TABLE_END Rilotumumab ##TABLE_START  In November 2012, we initiated a phase 3 study for the treatment of gastric cancer. ##TABLE_END Brodalumab (AMG 827) ##TABLE_START  In October 2012, we announced the start of a phase 3 program in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The program consists of three phase 3 studies, with ustekinumab and/or placebo controls. Brodalumab is one of five inflammation monoclonal antibodies being jointly developed in the collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc. (AstraZeneca). ##TABLE_END XGEVA   ##TABLE_START  In April 2012, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for XGEVA  to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases. The Complete Response Letter states that the FDA cannot approve the application in its present form. The FDA determined that the effect on bone metastases-free survival was of insufficient magnitude to outweigh the risks (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) of XGEVA  in the intended population. ##TABLE_END Romosozumab (AMG 785) ##TABLE_START  In April 2012, we along with our partner UCB announced the start of two phase 3 clinical studies in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The registrational study is a placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate incidence of new vertebral fractures at 12 and 24 months in 6,000 patients. We are also conducting an active-controlled trial versus alendronate that will evaluate the incidence of clinical fracture and new vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months in 4,000 patients. ##TABLE_END Acquisitions/Collaborations ##TABLE_START  In June 2012, we acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals (MN), a privately held company that is a leading supplier of pharmaceuticals to the hospital sector and a major supplier of injectable medicines in Turkey. The acquisition provides us with the opportunity to expand our presence in Turkey and the surrounding region. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In March 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies from Amgen's clinical inflammation portfolio including brodalumab, AMG 139, AMG 157, AMG 181 and AMG 557. The agreement covers the worldwide development and commercialization except for certain Asian countries for brodalumab and Japan for AMG 557, which are licensed to other third parties. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In March 2012, we acquired Micromet, Inc. (Micromet), a publicly held biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. ##TABLE_END  Marketed Products We market our principal products, Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , XGEVA  and Prolia  , in supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Certain of our marketed products face  and our product candidates, if approved, are also expected to face  substantial competition. Our products competitive positions among other biological and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, timing of market entry and patent position and expirations. Over the next several years, certain of the existing patents on our principal products will expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is biosimilar to the original reference product. This demonstration will typically consist of comparative analytical, preclinical and clinical data from the biosimilar to show that it has similar safety and efficacy as the reference product. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under a new, abbreviated pathway. In February 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents that provide insight into the FDAs current thinking on the development of biosimilars and broad parameters for the scientific assessment of biosimilar applications. The FDA guidance documents leave room for the FDA to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the specifics of what evidence would be required for a biosimilar to gain approval. (See Government Regulation.) In the European Union (EU), there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe, that may seek to obtain U.S. approval. In some cases we may experience additional competition prior to the expiration of our patents as a result of agreements we have made in connection with the settlement of patent litigation with companies developing potentially competing products. See the discussions of Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  later in this section. Further, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition to the challenges presented by competition, our existing products and product candidates are also subject to increasing regulatory compliance requirements that could be imposed as conditions of approval or after a product has been approved. This is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. While such therapies may offer important benefits and/or better treatment alternatives, they may also involve relatively new or higher levels of scientific complexity and may therefore generate increased safety concerns. We design and implement comprehensive proactive pharmacovigilance programs for all of our products to help ensure the detection, assessment and communication of adverse effects. When deemed necessary and appropriate, additional measures for risk communication and mitigation are designed and implemented in consultation with regulatory agencies. As a condition of approval or due to safety concerns after a product has been approved, we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or studies, including postmarketing requirements (PMRs) and postmarketing commitments (PMCs). A PMR is a trial or study that a sponsor company is required by statute or regulation to conduct. A PMC is a trial or study that a sponsor company agrees to in writing, but is not required by law, to conduct. In addition, we may be required to implement risk management plans for our products in the various regions in which they are approved. The FDA requires risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) for various approved products to ensure that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. A REMS may also be imposed as a condition of approval or after a product has been on the market. A REMS may include a medication guide or a patient package insert, a healthcare provider communication plan or elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor company to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA evaluates such assessments and may require additional modifications to the REMS elements. REMS may also be modified as the FDA and companies gain more experience with REMS and how they are implemented, operated and monitored. We currently have REMS for a number of our marketed products. See discussion on PMRs, PMCs and REMS in Government Regulation. Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs, which influence demand. The reimbursement environment continues to evolve with greater emphasis on both cost containment and demonstration of the economic value of products. In addition, the current worldwide economic conditions have also contributed to increasing pressures on cost containment. Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), a joint venture between Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin), and Amgen. See Business Relationships  Kirin-Amgen, Inc. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  stimulate production of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the bodys fight against infection. Both the treatments for various diseases and the diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. NEUPOGEN  is our registered trademark for Filgrastim, our recombinant-methionyl human G-CSF. Neulasta  is our registered trademark for pegfilgrastim, a pegylated protein based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule is added to the Filgrastim molecule to make pegfilgrastim. Because pegfilgrastim is eliminated from the body through binding to its receptor on neutrophils and neutrophil precursor cells, pegfilgrastim remains in circulation in the body until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN  , which requires more frequent dosing. We market Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Administration of Neulasta  in all cycles of chemotherapy is approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a clinically significant risk of febrile neutropenia. NEUPOGEN  was launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN  is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever; reducing the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; reducing the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in cancer patients who have undergone myeloablative chemotherapy for stem cell transplantation; and reducing the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,207  $ 3,006  $ 2,654 Neulasta   rest-of-the-world (ROW)   Total Neulasta  4,092  3,952  3,558 NEUPOGEN   U.S. 1,007   NEUPOGEN   ROW   Total NEUPOGEN  1,260  1,260  1,286 Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 5,352  $ 5,212  $ 4,844 ##TABLE_ENDOur outstanding material patents for pegfilgrastim are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Pegylated G-CSF  10/20/2015 Europe (1)   Pegylated G-CSF  2/8/2015 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  This European patent is also entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country. For example, supplementary protection certificates covering pegfilgrastim have issued in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and will expire in 2017. ##TABLE_END Our outstanding material patents for Filgrastim are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  G-CSF polypeptides  12/3/2013 U.S.  Methods of treatment using G-CSF polypeptides  12/10/2013 ##TABLE_ENDOur principal European patent related to G-CSF expired in August 2006. Upon expiration of that patent, some companies received approval to market products, including biosimilars, that compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  in Europe, as further discussed below. Our outstanding material U.S. patents for Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN  ) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN  and, in turn, Neulasta  . See discussion of Teva below. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, severe chronic neutropenia and AML could negatively impact Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  sales. Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  sales may also be impacted by increases or decreases in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, which may result from changes in the number of patients being treated, changes to treatment protocols or the introduction of new cancer treatments that may not be myelosuppressive. Further, NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe, and NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  , which we believe is substantially complete. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Neulasta  and/or NEUPOGEN  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care setting. The table below and the following discussion of competitor marketed products and products in development may not be exhaustive. ##TABLE_START Territory  Competitor Marketed Product  Competitor U.S.  Leukine   Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals (Bayer) Europe  Granocyte   Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd./Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi) Europe  Ratiograstim (1) /Biograstim (1)  ratiopharm GmbH (ratiopharm) (2) /CT Arzneimittel GmbH (CT Arzneimittel) Europe  Tevagrastim (1)  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

The approval was on the basis of a full BLA rather than under the FDA's new biosimilar approval pathway. This drug may compete with NEUPOGEN  subject to the terms of the injunction and settlement agreement discussed below. In November 2009, Teva Pharmaceutical filed a declaratory judgment action against us alleging that certain of our NEUPOGEN  patents are invalid and not infringed by its tbo-filgrastim product, and in January 2010, we filed an answer and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that our patents are valid and infringed. In July 2011, we announced that the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Teva Pharmaceutical and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (together defined as Teva) prohibiting them from infringing our patents relating to human G-CSF polypeptides and methods of treatment. The courts injunction extends until November 10, 2013, after which date Teva will no longer be prohibited by the injunction from selling its tbo-filgrastim product in the United States. Teva also agreed not to sell balugrastim, a long-acting product candidate, in the United States before November 10, 2013, unless it first obtains a final court decision that our patents are not infringed by balugrastim. Pursuant to the parties settlement, the launch date for either product could be sooner if certain unexpected events occur: a third party launches a similar G-CSF polypeptide product and we fail to sue that third party, or the patents are held invalid or unenforceable in a final court decision in an action brought by a third party. Several companies have short-acting filgrastim product candidates in phase 3 clinical development, including: ##TABLE_START  Merck  Company, Inc.

(Neupeg) ##TABLE_END 5 Enbrel  (etanercept) ENBREL is our registered trademark for etanercept, our TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to its receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune systems ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL binds certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation. ENBREL was launched in the United States in November 1998 and in Canada in March 2001. ENBREL is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: moderate to severe active RA; chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; active psoriatic arthritis; and active ankylosing spondylitis. It is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients ages two and older. We market ENBREL under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada, which expires October 31, 2013. (See Business Relationships  Pfizer Inc.) The rights to market and sell ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer.

Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of a protein called erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count can result in anemia, a condition in which insufficient oxygen is delivered to the bodys organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients either on or not on dialysis. Individuals with CKD may suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys and stimulates erythropoiesis. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with non-myeloid malignancies. ESAs, including ours, have faced and continue to face challenges. For example, based on adverse safety results observed beginning in late 2006 in various studies, performed by us and by others, that explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label, the product labeling of our ESAs in the United States and the EU has been updated several times to reflect those safety concerns. In addition, due in part to certain of these developments, reimbursement of our ESAs in the United States was also revised. These regulatory and reimbursement changes have led to changes in the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, including by decreasing the number of patients treated with ESAs as well as the average dose and duration of ESA therapy. In 2010 and 2011, the FDA and Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) took a number of actions with respect to the label for and the reimbursement of ESAs: ##TABLE_START  Effective January 1, 2011, CMS implemented the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis, providing a single payment for all dialysis services (with the exception of oral drugs without intravenous equivalents). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In June 2011, the FDA approved ESA label changes impacting both patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis. While the previous label language specified a hemoglobin (Hb) target range of 10-12 grams per deciliter (g/dL) for patients in both populations, the new label advises physicians treating patients on dialysis to initiate ESA therapy when the Hb level is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose when the Hb approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL. For CKD patients not on dialysis receiving ESA treatment, the new label advises physicians to initiate ESA therapy when the Hb level is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose when the Hb exceeds 10 g/dL. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In November 2011, CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled-payment system for dialysis services and the related end stage renal disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP). The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond the QIP's measure that tracks the percent of a provider's Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In June 2010, CMS opened a National Coverage Analysis (NCA) to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Following further analysis, in June 2011, CMS issued a Final Decision Memorandum (FDM) in which it determined that it would not issue a National Coverage Determination (NCD) at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD. In the absence of an NCD, Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) may be made by regional contractors called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). Since CMS issued their FDM, three MACs have issued a revised LCD relating to anemia in patients with CKD not on dialysis. These three MACs provide ESA coverage no more restrictive than the revised label. ##TABLE_END 7 Certain of these developments have had a material adverse impact on sales of our ESAs. In addition, in November 2011, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), commencing January 1, 2012, to supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. We have an ongoing oncology pharmacovigilance program in place for Aranesp  . The five clinical trials originally included in the program explored the use of ESAs in settings different from those outlined in the FDA approved label and were designated by the FDA as PMCs. Of the five studies, one was sponsored by Amgen while the other four were investigator-sponsored. Four of the studies are complete and analysis of the results from the fifth study is currently ongoing. The results of certain of those studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESAs and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. In addition, Janssen Research  Development, LLC (JRD), a subsidiary of JJ, and/or its investigators have conducted numerous studies that contribute to the understanding of ESA safety. Results of the JRD studies were submitted to the FDA. Additionally, based on discussions with the FDA, we and JRD have carefully considered potential new study designs to determine the effects of ESAs on survival and tumor outcomes in anemic patients with metastatic cancer receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Based on those discussions, we are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo (Study '782) as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. In addition, JRDs EPO-ANE-3010 study in breast cancer is ongoing. Both studies are designated by the FDA as PMR clinical trials. For the nephrology setting, we have been engaged in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding additional PMRs to explore alternative ESA dosing strategies in CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. In July 2012 we initiated study '226 to evaluate Aranesp  use in CKD patients not on dialysis. We expect to discuss further with the FDA a potential study in CKD patients on dialysis. In January 2013, we announced the top-line results of the phase 3 Aranesp  RED-HF  (Reduction of Events With Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure) Trial. The trial was initiated in 2006, and a total of 2,278 patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure and anemia (Hb levels ranging from 9.0-12.0 g/dL) were randomized to receive either treatment with Aranesp  to achieve a target Hb of at least 13.0 g/dL (not to exceed 14.5 g/dL), or placebo. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the composite endpoint of time to death from any cause or first hospital admission for worsening heart failure. There were no new safety findings identified in the study. These summary results will be followed by full efficacy and safety analyses, which will be shared and discussed with global regulatory agencies and submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. Adverse events or results of any of these studies could further affect product labeling, healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and/or reimbursement practices related to Aranesp  or EPOGEN  . Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We were granted an exclusive license by K-A to manufacture and market Aranesp  in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We market Aranesp  primarily in the United States and Europe, and it was launched in 2001 in both regions. It is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD (in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and also for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Total Aranesp  sales were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Aranesp   U.S. $  $  $ 1,103 Aranesp   ROW 1,258  1,317  1,383 Total Aranesp  $ 2,040  $ 2,303  $ 2,486 ##TABLE_ENDOur outstanding material patents for darbepoetin alfa are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins  5/15/2024 Europe (1)  Glycosylation analogs of erythropoietin proteins  8/16/2014 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  This European patent is also entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe and the length of any such extension will vary by country.

Although we do not market EPOGEN  in Europe, upon expiration of this patent, some companies received approval to market products, including biosimilars, that compete with Aranesp  in Europe, as further discussed below. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy and/or renal failure could negatively impact Aranesp  sales. In the United States, Aranesp  competes with EPOGEN  , primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that compete with Aranesp  in the United States and Europe in the supportive cancer care and nephrology segments, unless otherwise indicated.

We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a subsidiary of JJ (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Janssen), a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all indications other than dialysis. We market EPOGEN  in the United States and it was launched in 1989. EPOGEN  is indicated to treat a lower than normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by CKD in patients on dialysis to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    EPOGEN   U.S. $ 1,941  $ 2,040  $ 2,524 ##TABLE_ENDOur outstanding material patents for epoetin alfa are described in the following table. ##TABLE_START Territory  General Subject Matter  Expiration U.S.  Product claims to erythropoietin  8/20/2013 U.S.  Pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin  8/20/2013 U.S.  Pharmaceutical erythropoietin formulation with certain stabilizers  9/24/2014 U.S.  Cells that make certain levels of erythropoietin  5/26/2015 ##TABLE_ENDAny products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with renal failure could negatively impact EPOGEN  sales. In the United States, as noted above, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinic setting. In March 2012, the FDA approved OMONTYS  (peginesatide), a synthetic, PEGylated peptidic compound that binds to and stimulates the erythropoietin receptor and thus acts as an ESA. OMONTYS  was co-developed by Affymax, Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) and competes with EPOGEN  in the United States in the nephrology segment in patients with CKD who are on dialysis. On February 23, 2013, Affymax, Inc. and Takeda announced that they had decided to voluntarily recall all lots of OMONTYS  Injection to the user level as a result of new postmarketing reports regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening or fatal. XGEVA  /Prolia  (denosumab) In 2010, we launched XGEVA  and Prolia  , both of which contain the same active ingredient but which are approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. We have a collaboration agreement with Glaxo Group Limited (Glaxo), a wholly owned subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), for the commercialization of denosumab in certain countries.

XGEVA  is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. In July 2011, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for XGEVA  for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. The EC also granted XGEVA  an additional year of data and market exclusivity in the EU since the indication was considered new for denosumab and based on the significant clinical benefit of XGEVA  in comparison with existing therapies. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors could negatively impact XGEVA  sales.

Generic forms of zoledronic acid became available in other major markets in 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  This product has lost its patent protection and generic versions of this product are available. ##TABLE_END In addition, Bayer has filed with the FDA for approval of alpharadin for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases, that may compete with XGEVA  in the future. Prolia   In June 2010, the FDA approved Prolia  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In September 2011, we announced that the FDA approved two additional indications for Prolia  as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. In September 2012, the FDA approved Prolia  for a treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. In May 2010, the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in treating osteoporosis in patients at high risk for fracture could negatively impact Prolia  sales.

Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  is our registered trademark in the United States and Mimpara  is our registered trademark in Europe for cinacalcet, our small molecule medicine used in treating CKD patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. In 2004, Sensipar  /Mimpara  was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In 2008, Mimpara  was approved in Europe for the reduction of hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) where a parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. In 2011, Sensipar  was approved in the United States for the treatment of severe hypercalcemia in patients with PHPT who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy. We market Sensipar  primarily in the United States and Mimpara  primarily in Europe. As previously discussed, CMSs Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis became effective on January 1, 2011, and provides a single payment for all dialysis services. Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will continue to be reimbursed separately under the Medicare Part D benefit until they are included in the bundled-payment system, which was delayed by Congress from 2014 to 2016 in connection with the passage in January 2013 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA).  Inclusion in the bundled-payment system may reduce utilization of these oral drugs and have an adverse impact on our sales. See Reimbursement . In November 2012, we presented at ASN's Kidney Week the results of the phase 3 E.V.O.L.V.E  trial. As previously reported, the primary analysis showed that the trial did not reach its primary endpoint (time to composite event comprising all-cause mortality or first non-fatal cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure or peripheral vascular event) in the intent-to-treat analysis.

(Barr) for infringement of four Sensipar  patents. The lawsuit was based on Abbreviated New Drug Applications (NDA) filed by Teva and Barr that sought approval to market generic versions of Sensipar  . Following trial, in January 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware granted an injunction prohibiting Teva and Barr from commercializing generic versions of Sensipar  in the United States until expiration of three of those patents. These generic versions could compete with Sensipar  in the future. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is our registered trademark for panitumumab, our monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after disease progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens. EGFr is a protein that plays an important role in cancer cell signaling and is over-expressed in many human cancers. Vectibix  binds with high affinity to EGFrs and interferes with signals that might otherwise stimulate growth and survival of the cancer cell. In September 2006, Vectibix  received FDA accelerated approval in the United States, based upon clinical trial data from a study demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and with the condition that Amgen conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the clinical benefit of panitumumab through demonstration of an improvement in overall survival. (See discussion of the '181 trial below.) In the EU, the conditional approval of Vectibix  as monotherapy, for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens, was received in December 2007 and is reviewed annually by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Each year thereafter, the EU conditional marketing authorization was renewed with an additional specific obligation to conduct a clinical trial in the approved monotherapy indication. In 2010, we began enrollment for this additional clinical trial which compares the effect of Vectibix  versus Erbitux  (cetuximab) on overall survival for chemorefractory mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS genes. KRAS  is a protein found in all human cells. Some colorectal cancers have mutations in the KRAS gene. Vectibix  has been shown to be ineffective in people whose tumors had KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13. In 2009, we announced results from the 203 and 181 pivotal phase 3 trials evaluating Vectibix  in combination with chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) as a first- and second-line treatment for mCRC, respectively. Both studies demonstrated that Vectibix  administered with chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. Additionally, both studies showed numeric improvements in median overall survival in the same patient population. The numeric improvements in median overall survival failed to achieve statistical significance. It was previously agreed with the FDA that the '181 study would serve as the confirmatory trial for establishing full approval for the mCRC indication. In July 2011, we announced that we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line mCRC sBLAs that we filed in late 2010. The FDA did not ask for new clinical studies but did request an updated safety analysis and additional analyses of the overall survival data in the 181 and 203 studies using more mature data sets. The FDA has also informed us that approval for the first- and second-line mCRC indications will be contingent upon approval of the companion diagnostic device being developed in collaboration with QIAGEN N.V. (QIAGEN), which identifies a patients KRAS gene status. We are currently working on addressing the FDAs requests in the Complete Response Letters. In November 2011, the EC approved a variation to the marketing authorization for Vectibix  to include indications for the treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC in first- and second-line in combination with chemotherapy.

In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat and we provide support for various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas. See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion for a discussion of government regulation of product marketing and promotion. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors. We utilize those wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. In Europe, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers, and we limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, for certain customers, by requiring letters of credit. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for approximately 94%, 90% and 88% of our gross product sales in the United States, respectively and approximately 76%, 72% and 71% of our total worldwide gross revenues, respectively in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Reimbursement Sales of all of our principal products are dependent in large part on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. Most patients receiving our products are covered by government healthcare programs or private insurers. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products; and private insurers may adopt or be influenced by government coverage and reimbursement methodologies. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. An increasing worldwide focus on patient access controls and cost containment by public and private insurers has resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our products. In addition, healthcare reforms enacted in the United States have made substantial long-term changes to the reimbursement of our products, and those changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business. U.S. Reimbursement System Our principal products are sold primarily in the United States, and healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals and other healthcare professionals and providers, are reimbursed by the government through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers for covered services and products they use. Government healthcare programs are funded primarily through the payment of taxes by individuals and businesses. The public and private components of this multi-payer system are described below. Medicare and Other Forms of Public Health Insurance Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals 65 years or older as well as those with certain disabilities or ESRD regardless of their age. The primary Medicare programs that affect reimbursement for our products are Medicare Part B, which covers physician services and outpatient care, and Medicare Part D, which provides a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare (as well as Medicaid, described below) and, among its responsibilities, has authority to promulgate regulations and policies, as well as issue reimbursement codes for drugs, all of which can determine how medical items and services are covered and reimbursed by Medicare. CMS can also issue Medicare NCDs, which are national policy determinations granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage for specific medical items or services applicable throughout the United States. In the absence of a relevant NCD, Medicare coverage determinations for a particular medical item or service are left to MACs, who issue LCDs, which are binding on providers within their respective jurisdictions. CMS sometimes uses advisory committees of external experts in order to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. For example, the Medicare Evidence Development  Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) was established to provide independent guidance and expert advice for CMS on specific clinical topics. The MEDCAC reviews and evaluates medical literature and technology assessments and examines data and information on the effectiveness and appropriateness of medical items and services that are covered under Medicare or that may be eligible for coverage under Medicare. Medicare Part B Coverage of Drugs. Medicare Part B provides limited coverage of outpatient drugs and biologicals that are reasonable and necessary for a medically accepted diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury and that fall into a statutory benefit category. One such category relevant to our products covers drugs and biologicals furnished incident to a physicians services. Generally, incident-to drugs and biologicals are covered if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that are not usually self-administered by the patient. Medicare Part B also covers certain drugs pursuant to specific statutory benefit categories, such as blood-clotting factors and certain immunosuppressive drugs, erythropoietin and certain oral cancer drugs. Many of our principal products are currently covered under Medicare Part B (as well as other government healthcare programs). Medicare Part D Coverage of Drugs . Medicare Part D provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit for Medicare eligible beneficiaries. The coverage is available through private plans that provide insurance coverage for prescription drugs for a monthly premium and with patient cost sharing. The list of prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D plans varies by plan, but drug lists maintained by individual plans must cover certain classes of drugs and biologicals; specifically the statute stipulates that Medicare Part D plans have at least two drugs in each unique therapeutic category or class, subject to certain exceptions. Medicare ESRD Program. Most patients with ESRD, regardless of age, are eligible for coverage of dialysis treatment through Medicare's ESRD Program. Because Medicare is the primary payer for dialysis treatment in the United States, reimbursement for products, such as EPOGEN  , that are typically administered in dialysis centers and other settings is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement policy. Since January 1, 2011, dialysis treatment under the ESRD Program has been reimbursed under a bundled-payment system described in more detail below. See Dialysis Reimbursement. Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by individual states for low-income and disabled eligible beneficiaries. CMS also has responsibility for federal administration of the Medicaid program. Under federal law, states must cover low-income adults and children, pregnant women, disabled individuals and seniors, and states have the option of expanding eligibility beyond those groups of beneficiaries. Medicaid is financed jointly by the states and the federal government through taxes. Medicaid offers a broad set of benefits, including prescription drugs, although coverage varies by state. Medicaid includes the Drug Rebate Program, which requires that manufacturers provide rebates for the states for products covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Private Health Insurance Employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance currently represents the main pathway by which Americans receive private health insurance. Many employers provide health insurance as part of employees benefit packages. Insurance plans are administered by private companies  both for-profit and not-for-profit  and some companies are self-insured (i.e., they pay directly through a plan administered by a third party for all healthcare costs incurred by employees). Generally, employer-sponsored insurance premiums are paid primarily by employers and secondarily by employees. Individual market. The individual market covers part of the population that is self-employed or retired. In addition, it covers some people who are unable to obtain insurance through their employers. The plans are administered by private insurance companies. Individuals pay out-of-pocket insurance premiums for coverage, and the benefits vary widely according to plan specifications. Efforts to reduce health care costs are being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Amgen expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost and/or utilization of healthcare products including our products. Reimbursement of Our Principal Products Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Prolia  and XGEVA  . Medicare and Medicaid payment policies for drugs and biologicals are subject to various laws and regulations. The Medicare program covers our principal products Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Prolia  and XGEVA  (as well as certain of our other products, including Vectibix  and Nplate  ) primarily under Part B, when administered in the physician clinic setting and the hospital outpatient setting. Healthcare providers are reimbursed for these products under a buy-and-bill process whereby providers purchase the product in advance of treatment and then submit a reimbursement claim to Medicare following administration of the product. Medicare reimburses providers by using a payment methodology based on a fixed percentage of each products average sales price (ASP). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated and reported to CMS on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current Period) is based on certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a defined period of time preceding the Current Period. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect so healthcare providers will know the applicable reimbursement rates. In the calculation of ASP, CMS currently allows manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute and regulations and their customary business practices; in the future, CMS may provide more specific guidance. Any changes to the ASP calculations directly affect the Medicare reimbursement for our products administered in the physician clinic setting, hospital outpatient setting and, to a lesser extent, the dialysis facility setting. (See Dialysis Reimbursement.) Our ASP calculations are reviewed quarterly for completeness, and based on such review, we have on occasion restated our reported ASPs to reflect calculation changes both prospectively and retroactively. See Items 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In general, drugs and biologicals provided in the physician clinic setting and in the hospital outpatient setting are reimbursed under Medicare Part B at a certain percentage of their ASP (sometimes referred to as ASP +X%). The 2013 reimbursement rates in both settings will be ASP +6%. The rate for the physician clinic setting is set by statute, but CMS has authority to adjust the rate for the hospital outpatient setting annually. Commercial payers may use the government's ASP data in setting their payment methodologies for drugs and biologicals provided in the physician clinic and hospital outpatient settings. The extent to which commercial payers rely on the government's ASP data and the specific ASP +X% used is often based on the contractual relationship between the provider and the insurer. For fiscal years 2013-21, Medicare payment rates are scheduled to be affected by across-the-board budget cuts (referred to commonly as sequestration) mandated under the Budget Control Act (the BCA) and revised by the ATRA, as explained more fully below in Impact of Budget Control Act on U.S. Reimbursement. Under sequestration, CMS can reduce Medicare payments to providers, including ASP-based reimbursement, by up to 2% per fiscal year. Dialysis Reimbursement. Currently, dialysis providers in the United States are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by Medicare through the ESRD Program, which is established by federal law and implemented by CMS. Historically, the ESRD Program reimbursed Medicare providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder was paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers, at ASP +6%, by using the same payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMSs bundled-payment system went into effect for dialysis providers by establishing a single payment for all dialysis services, including drugs, supplies and non-routine laboratory tests that had previously been reimbursed separately. ESRD providers receive a designated payment for each dialysis treatment and can be paid for up to three treatments per week unless medical necessity justifies more frequent treatments. Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will continue to be reimbursed separately under the Medicare Part D benefit until they are included in the bundled-payment system in 2016. Inclusion in the bundled-payment system may reduce utilization of these oral drugs and have an adverse impact on our sales. To encourage dialysis providers to continue to provide quality dialysis treatment under the new bundled-payment system, CMS also implemented the ESRD QIP. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, ESRD facilities are subject to a payment penalty of up to 2% of amounts reimbursed for failure to meet or exceed CMSs quality performance standards, including performance standards related to anemia management and dialysis adequacy. In November 2011, following our June 2011 announcement of changes to the labels for the use of ESAs in patients with CKD, CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled-payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP. The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond one of the QIP's measures that tracks the percent of a provider's Medicare patients with a Hb level below 10 g/dL. CMS indicated that removal of this quality measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. We believe that the implementation of these various changes in the dialysis setting has resulted and could result in a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN  and on our business and results of operations. Data available through October 2012 indicates a stabilization of Hb levels. ENBREL Reimbursement. The majority of prescription claims for ENBREL are paid through private insurance companies. Under Medicare, ENBREL is reimbursed through the Part D program, although less than 10% of all ENBREL U.S. prescriptions are reimbursed by Medicare. Mandatory Government Rebates and Discounts Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program established in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments of that law. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate to the states for each unit of our product reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each of our products is currently set by law as a minimum of 23.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any non-government customer. The rebate amount is determined for each quarter based on our reports to CMS of the quarters AMP and best price for each of our products. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The statutory definition of AMP changed in 2010 as a result of the U.S. healthcare reform law, and in January 2012, CMS issued a proposed rule further defining the new AMP definition. Until that rule is finalized, we are required to make reasonable assumptions when calculating AMP. Once CMSs proposed rule is finalized, we will have to determine whether our calculations should be amended and whether we will need to restate our prior AMPs. The terms of our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. Related to our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program is a requirement that we extend comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) drug pricing program to eligible community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHC Act), federal law has required that we offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of our products under the Medicaid program or purchase of our products by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. The accuracy of our reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs and our FSS contract prices may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws and the terms of our FSS contract. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies in calculation of Non-FAMPs and FCPs is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. Also, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false Non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect. Finally, we are required to disclose in our FSS contract proposal all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than our proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, we are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract price reductions clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. U.S. Healthcare Reform. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to the PPACA, primarily with respect to the PPACAs financial and budgetary impacts, were signed into law. We refer to those two laws collectively as the U.S. healthcare reform law. The U.S. healthcare reform law imposes additional costs on and reduces the revenue of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The following paragraphs describe certain provisions of the healthcare reform law that are affecting and will affect our business. The U.S. healthcare reform law also imposed a new fee (the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee) on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, which includes drugs approved under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or biological products licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act. The U.S. healthcare reform law set an aggregate annual fee, to be paid by these manufacturers and importers, totaling $28 billion over 10 years beginning in 2011. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies, including us, based on each companys sales of qualifying products to, and utilization by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The additional fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Manufacturers and importers of generic or biosimilar drugs are not subject to the fee. Other changes under the U.S. healthcare reform law that became effective in 2010 include: (i) an increase in the rebates we pay to the states for our products that are covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, (ii) the extension of the Medicaid drug rebate program to patients in Medicaid managed care insurance plans for whom rebates were not previously required and (iii) the expansion of the list of provider institutions to which we must extend discounts under the PHS 340B drug-pricing program. When the Medicare Part D drug benefit took effect in 2006, standard benefit Part D plan enrollees were required to pay 100% of their prescription drug costs after their total drug spending exceeded an initial coverage limit and until they qualified for catastrophic coverage. This coverage gap is sometimes referred to as the Part D doughnut hole. Then the PPACA directed CMS to phase out up to 50% of this coverage gap from 2011 to 2020. Under the standard benefit, cost sharing for both brand and generic drugs will be reduced each year until 2020, when the coverage gap will be eliminated and beneficiaries will pay 25% cost sharing for all drugs until they reach the out-of-pocket threshold. Manufacturers like Amgen are presently required to provide a 50% cost sharing discount for beneficiaries in the doughnut hole. The U.S. healthcare reform law also expands Medicaid eligibility to include those with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), from 100% of the FPL. This provision becomes effective January 1, 2014. Impact of Budget Control Act on U.S. Reimbursement The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law in the United States in August 2011, mandated a 2% reduction in government payments for all Medicare services (including the administration of separately billable drugs and payment for drugs in all Medicare programs) for federal fiscal years 2013-21. The impact of sequestration remains subject to administrative implementation of the Budget Control Act, as updated by the more recent ATRA, or future statutory revision by Congress, which could block, limit or otherwise modify the automatic spending cuts. Several alternative deficit reduction proposals have been put forth by President Obama and/or congressional committees, including proposals designed to further limit federal healthcare expenditures. We cannot predict whether any deficit reduction actions will be approved by Congress and/or whether a budget sequestration will ultimately occur for Medicare services. A reduction in reimbursement for drugs and biologics for U.S. healthcare programs as a result of changes such as those that have been proposed or as a result other changes designed to achieve similar federal budget savings could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Reimbursement Outside the United States Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems have traditionally been the primary payers of all healthcare costs, including payment for drugs and biologicals. Over the past several years, the reimbursement environment in Europe has become very challenging. The proliferation of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations (e.g., National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK and the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in Germany) has led to recommendations and/or determinations of coverage and reimbursement based on both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product. Although the methods employed by different HTA agencies vary from country to country, the use of formal economic metrics has been increasing across Europe as well as in several emerging markets throughout the world. In addition to determining whether or not a new product will be reimbursed, these agencies are becoming increasingly involved in setting the maximum price at which the product will be reimbursed - the value-based price for a product. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. Mandatory price controls continue to be a significant aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in most countries outside the United States. In some countries, international price referencing is the primary mechanism for price control, whereby the ceiling price of a pharmaceutical or biological product is set based on prices in particular benchmark countries. These price-referencing rules are increasing in complexity as payers seek lower-price benchmarks against which to compare themselves. Trends across Europe are also leading toward increased price transparency, with the development of databases to include prices across Europe and requests from specific national payers that manufacturers provide commercially confidential net price information. Additional cost-containment measures can include therapeutic reference pricing (e.g., setting the reimbursement rate for a given class of agents at the lowest price within the class), increasing mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. In addition, healthcare reform and related legislative proposals in such countries as France, Germany, and Poland, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, clawbacks of payments made to companies when drug spending thresholds are exceeded, preferences for biosimilars, changes in international price referencing, price transparency to achieve prices similar to those in lower-priced countries, and reductions in the amount of reimbursement, sometimes with the imposition of patient copayments. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to reward new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. This could impact coverage, price, time to achieve reimbursement, and ultimate level of reimbursement. In many countries, the influence of regional and hospital payers also contributes to whether patients have access to certain products. For example, a product may be listed successfully on a national formulary, but may also be subject to further evaluations or competitive bidding by payers at a regional or hospital level. The impact of multiple layers of assessment can result in delay or failure to secure access and/or net price pressure. Payers in some countries are using and others are beginning to experiment with alternative payment mechanisms (e.g., payment caps, risk sharing) as a means to achieve or maintain access to innovative therapies while increasing their budget certainty. Requirements for such payment mechanisms can adversely impact Amgens business through increased net price concessions and added administrative burden. While we cannot fully predict either the extent of further price reductions and/or reimbursement restrictions taken by governmental payers outside the United States or the impact such actions will have on our business, such reductions in price and/or the coverage and reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Fraud and Abuse Regulations Related to Reimbursement As participants in government reimbursement programs, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. (See Government Regulation  Other . ) Violations of fraud and abuse laws can result in stringent enforcement penalties up to and including complete exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing Biological products, which are produced in living systems, are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish and distribution activities. Bulk manufacturing includes fermentation and/or cell culture  processes by which our proteins are produced  and also includes purification of the proteins to a high quality. The proteins are then formulated into stable forms. The fill process dispenses the formulated bulk protein into vials or syringes. Finally, in the finish process, our products are packaged for distribution. We operate a number of commercial and/or clinical manufacturing facilities, and our primary facilities are located in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. (See Item 2. Properties.) We also use and expect to continue to use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of certain of our large molecule marketed products as well as a number of our clinical product candidates. Manufacturing of Sensipar  /Mimpara  , our small molecule product, is currently performed by third-party contract manufacturers, except for certain fill and finish activities performed by us in Puerto Rico. The global supply of our products depends on actively managing the inventory produced at our facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers and the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. During the manufacturing scale-up process, and even after achieving sustainable commercial manufacturing, we may encounter difficulties or disruptions due to defects in raw materials or equipment, contamination or other factors that could impact product availability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales and  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. Commercial Bulk Manufacturing We operate commercial bulk manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in several locations throughout the United States for most of our products. (See Item 2. Properties.) We have the option to supplement commercial bulk manufacturing for ENBREL, Prolia  , XGEVA  and Vectibix  with a third-party contract manufacturer. Commercial Formulation, Fill and Finish Manufacturing We perform most of our commercial protein formulation, fill and finish manufacturing in our Puerto Rico facility. Formulation, fill and finish manufacturing for Nplate  and Vectibix  is performed by third-party contract manufacturers. In addition to the formulation, fill and finish of ENBREL performed by us in Puerto Rico, fill and finish of a certain portion of ENBREL is also performed by third-party contract manufacturers. We also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands. See Item 2. Properties. Clinical Manufacturing Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California, location. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United States, principally in Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. In addition, we also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our commercial and clinical products in certain areas of the world. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands perform key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, distribution and production scheduling. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation  FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to optimize our manufacturing network and/or mitigate risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our commercial products. The facilities impacted by each of these initiatives will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authorities. These initiatives include the construction of a formulation and fill facility at our Puerto Rico site; and as part of a risk mitigation strategy, we plan modification and expansion of our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish site in Ireland to manufacture our products. In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, further optimize manufacturing asset utilization, continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and maintain a state of regulatory compliance. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials necessary for the commercial and clinical bulk manufacturing of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of our products are provided by unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be the sole sources. Certain of the raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from the specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. Certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials that may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development. We must conduct extensive clinical trials designed to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates in order to file for regulatory approval to market a product. Product development and approval within that regulatory framework take a number of years and involve our expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval we obtain remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions. In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing are substantial and may vary by product. For example, the phase 3 ongoing clinical trials for AMG 145 are large and require substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Foreign studies performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators and conforms to good clinical practice. Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may not be able to develop commercial products.) The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Applications . The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products subject to the Public Health Service Act or an NDA for drugs subject to the approval provisions of the FDCA. Submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDAs review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Post-approval Phase. After we have obtained approval to market our products, we monitor adverse events from the use of our products and report such events to regulatory agencies, along with information from post marketing surveillance or studies. We may utilize other research approaches to learn or confirm information about our marketed products, including observational studies and patient registries, and may engage in risk management activities such as physician education initiatives and patient advocacy group initiatives. We may also conduct or be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials to provide additional information on our marketed products safety and efficacy. Those additional trials may include studying doses or schedules of administration different from those used in previous studies, use in other patient populations or other stages of the disease or use over a longer period of time. Additional trials of this nature are sometimes required by regulatory agencies as a condition of their approval to market our products, and they might also request or require that we conduct specific studies, including observational epidemiological studies, in order to identify or assess possible safety risks of our marketed products that are observed or suggested by available scientific data and such trials are sometimes referred to as PMCs or PMRs. In the United States, if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, it may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk. If we are required to conduct such a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which our products have already been approved and to the reimbursement provided by government and commercial payers for our products. The FDA also has the authority to require companies to implement a REMS for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved or after approval based on new safety information, including new analyses of existing safety information. In determining whether a product will require a REMS before the product is approved, the FDA may consider a number of factors. Each REMS is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. While the elements of REMS may vary, all REMS require the sponsor to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. Failure to comply with a REMS, including submission of a required assessment or any modification to a REMS, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  and Nplate  . The FDA and sponsor companies continue to learn how best to implement, operate and monitor the effectiveness of REMS, and the requirements of our REMS and those of other companies may change over time. The FDA published guidance intended to limit or remove REMS requirements for certain products. The FDA will also be looking at ways to standardize REMS programs, with the intent to make the establishment, review and assessment of these programs less burdensome on the agency and the sponsor. The FDA will hold a series of public meetings on REMS over the next several years and will solicit stakeholder feedback in an effort to continue to focus and improve their risk management oversight. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. The FDA also uses various advisory committees of external experts to assist in its mission to protect and promote the public health and to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. The committees are generally advisory only and FDA officials are not bound to or limited by their recommendations. We have participated in meetings of the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drug Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs, among others, to address certain issues related to our products, including Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  . FDA Approval of Biosimilars . The PPACA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The new law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. In February 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars. While the FDA guidance documents are not legally binding on the public or on the FDA, they indicate the FDAs current thinking on the development of biosimilars. The draft guidance documents provide insight on a range of technical, scientific and regulatory issues. The guidance documents generally provide that, for approval, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar (a term defined by statute) to a single reference product already licensed by the FDA. In assessing biosimilarity, the FDA indicated that it intends to use a risk-based totality of the evidence approach to evaluate all available data submitted by the applicant. Generally, a biosimilar application must include a clinical study or studies sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more indications for which the reference product is licensed and the biosimilar applicant seeks approval. The scope and magnitude of clinical data needed will depend on the extent of uncertainty about the biosimilarity of the product as well as the frequency and severity of safety risks associated with the reference product. The FDA indicated that it is still evaluating a number of relevant issues, and additional guidance documents are expected to be released, including guidance on the criteria for interchangeability (which the FDA has indicated would be a higher standard than biosimilarity). FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of products. We are required to obtain the FDA approval before marketing or promoting a product as a treatment for a particular indication. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including suspension of our manufacturing operations. Such issues may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review. Regulation of Combination Products . When our products are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts (e.g., a biologic and a device). When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device are more complex, as in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. We expect that in the future a number of our pipeline products may meet this definition and be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework. In addition, due to regional differences in regulation structures and systems outside the United States, the definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly depending on the region. New Innovation Provisions Available to Regulatory Agencies Reviewing Drug Applications. In the United States, the FDA may grant accelerated approval status to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a product based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or based on an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. The sponsor/marketing applicant will then be required to conduct additional, post-approval confirmatory trials to verify and describe clinical benefit, and the product may have certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. The FDA is also given greater flexibility to withdraw approval granted under accelerated approval, if it is warranted. Additional legislation has been approved in 2012 that could further expand the FDA's authority. For example, the FDA may consider ways to more greatly use the accelerated approval pathway for rare or very rare diseases, and a new review designation was created to help foster the innovation of promising new therapies with the potential to shorten the timeframe for conducting pivotal trials and speed up patient access to the approved product. In Europe, the preexisting conditional approval pathway provides for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to apply greater flexibility in terms of their benefit/risk evaluation in order to promote innovation. While no plans to revise or add to this statutory provision have been announced, there are on-going discussions at the EMA to consider so-called adaptive licensing. It is not clear at this stage whether such proposals will result in meaningful changes to the EU regulatory approval pathway. Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the United States.  In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the EMA which conducts a thorough evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. In the EU, biosimilars have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be similar. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. After evaluation and marketing authorization, various parties, including the national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holders share pharmacovigilance responsibilities regarding the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. Healthcare professionals and patients are also encouraged to report adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. This process includes the collection of adverse drug reaction reports as part of the follow-up on any side effects of a product, and upon assessment, the authorities can decide to demand that product labels be updated with safety data or warnings, that safety data or warnings be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market. In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that contains new and revised requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, as well as codifying various existing requirements previously set out as guidance. The new legislation enhanced the authority of European regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy and safety studies, both at the time of approval and at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional requirements to include statements in product labeling with regard to adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. There also is expected to be significantly greater transparency of the safety review process as a result of the new legislation. Other countries such as those in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Turkey and the Middle East have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and for the most part rely on prior marketing approval (as demonstrated by a certificate of pharmaceutical product) from a foreign regulatory authority in the United States or EU. The regulatory process in these countries is less well defined than in the United States and frequently includes manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product on importation and other domestic requirements. Other. We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The federal government and the states have published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the safe harbors whenever possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities related to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). On December 19, 2012, Amgen announced that it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government, 49 states and the District of Columbia regarding allegations that Amgen's promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of those laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD with a focus on biologics. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, or other combination or new modalities. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. We conduct clinical trial activities using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue to open clinical sites and to enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. Those licenses and arrangements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, RD and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Various public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and government agencies conduct a significant amount of RD in the biotechnology industry. In pursuing RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into RD arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms. See Government Regulation  Clinical Development for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 11, 2013, unless otherwise indicated. Each disease or condition for our product candidates in phase 3 is listed separately. Additional product candidate (pipeline) information can be found on our website at http://www.amgen.com. (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials, such as the Pegfilgrastim and Anti-VEGF Evaluation Study (PAVES) trial evaluating Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim) use in patients receiving chemotherapy and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of locally-advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. See, for example, the discussion of our ESA pharmacovigilance trials under  Marketed Products  ESAs. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/Condition Phase 3 Programs   AMG 145  Hyperlipidemia Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa)  Myelodysplastic syndromes Brodalumab (AMG 827)  Psoriasis Prolia  (denosumab)  Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Prolia  (denosumab) - EU  Male osteoporosis Rilotumumab  Gastric cancer Romosozumab (AMG 785)  PMO Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet)  Post renal transplant Talimogene laherparepvec  Melanoma Trebananib (AMG 386)  Ovarian cancer Vectibix  (panitumumab) - U.S.  First- and second-line colorectal cancer XGEVA  (denosumab)  Delay or prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer XGEVA  (denosumab) - EU  Delay or prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer XGEVA  (denosumab)  Cancer-related bone damage (SREs) in patients with multiple myeloma Phase 2 Programs   AMG 151  Type 2 diabetes AMG 181  Inflammatory bowel disease AMG 416  Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD receiving dialysis AMG 747  Schizophrenia Blinatumomab (AMG 103)  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Blinatumomab  Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Brodalumab  Inflammatory diseases Omecamtiv mecarbil  Heart failure Prolia  (denosumab)  RA Trebananib  Various cancer types Vectibix  (panitumumab)  Squamous cell head and neck cancer XGEVA  (denosumab)  Giant cell tumor of the bone (GCTB) XGEVA  (denosumab)  Hypercalcemia of malignancy Phase 1 Programs   AMG 110  Various cancer types AMG 139  Inflammatory diseases AMG 157  Asthma AMG 167  Bone-related conditions AMG 172  Various cancer types AMG 208  Various cancer types AMG 232  Various cancer types AMG 319  Hematologic malignancies AMG 334  Migraine AMG 337  Various cancer types AMG 357  Autoimmune diseases AMG 557  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 595  Glioblastoma AMG 729  Autoimmune diseases AMG 780  Various cancer types AMG 811  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 820  Various cancer types AMG 876  Type 2 diabetes AMG 900  Various cancer types ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Phase 1 clinical trials investigate safety and proper dose ranges of a product candidate in a small number of human subjects.

Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_ENDThe following text provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials. AMG 145 AMG 145 is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9). It is being investigated as a treatment for hyperlipidemia. Phase 2 study results evaluating AMG 145 were reported at a medical meeting in November 2012 in the following four areas: as monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in statin-intolerant subjects. Based on the study results, phase 3 enrollment is underway in these populations. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  is a recombinant human protein agonist of the erythropoietin receptor. The phase 3 study of Aranesp  for the treatment of low risk myelodysplastic syndromes is ongoing. Brodalumab Brodalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-17 receptor. It is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Brodalumab is one of five inflammation monoclonal antibodies being jointly developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. In 2012, we initiated three phase 3 studies for the treatment of psoriasis. We completed our phase 2 study in psoriatic arthritis in 2012. Brodalumab is also being evaluated for the treatment of asthma. Denosumab Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. It is being investigated across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, RA and numerous tumor types across the spectrum of cancer-related bone diseases, including hypercalcemia of malignancy. Prolia  (denosumab) In September 2012, Prolia  was approved by the FDA for the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture in the US. A phase 3 study of Prolia  for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was initiated in 2012. XGEVA  (denosumab) In June 2012, we submitted a marketing application to the EMA for XGEVA  to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases. In December 2012, we submitted marketing applications to the FDA and EMA for XGEVA  for the treatment of GCTB in adults or skeletally mature adolescents. Phase 3 studies for the delay or prevention of bone metastases in patients with adjuvant breast cancer and prevention of SRE in patients with multiple myeloma are ongoing. Rilotumumab Rilotumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In 2012, we initiated a phase 3 study for the treatment of gastric cancer. Romosozumab Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin. Romosozumab is being developed in collaboration with UCB for PMO. In 2012, we initiated two phase 3 studies for the treatment of PMO in women. After reviewing the 52-week tibia data and recent regulatory guidance that deemed acceleration of fracture healing a non-viable endpoint for a phase 3 program, it was determined that we would not pursue this indication. This decision is based on the regulatory guidance and on the efficacy results from the acceleration of fracture healing endpoint in the tibia trial, not on safety. The safety profile remains consistent with what has been seen in the PMO program. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) Sensipar  /Mimpara  is an orally-administered small molecule that lowers PTH levels in blood by increasing sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to extracellular calcium. It is being evaluated in post renal transplant patients. Talimogene laherparepvec Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from HSV-1. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. The phase 3 study for the treatment of melanoma is ongoing. Trebananib Trebananib is a peptibody that inhibits the interaction between the endothelial cell-selective Tie2 receptor and its ligands Ang1 and Ang2. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. Phase 3 studies of trebananib for the treatment of first-line and recurrent ovarian cancer are ongoing. Phase 2 studies of trebananib for treatment of renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and NSCLC are ongoing. Vectibix  (panitumumab) Vectibix  is a human monoclonal antibody antagonist of the EGFr pathway. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In July 2011, we announced that we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line line mCRC sBLAs requesting additional information from the '181 and '203 studies. We are currently working on addressing the FDA's requests in the Complete Response Letters. AMG 151 AMG 151 is a small molecule glucokinase activator. It is being investigated as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. We completed our phase 2 study in 2012. AMG 181 AMG 181 is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of alpha4/beta7. It is being investigated as a treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with phase 2 studies initiated in 2012. AMG 181 is one of five inflammation monoclonal antibodies being jointly developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. AMG 416 AMG 416 is a peptide agonist of the human cell surface CaSR. It is being investigated as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD receiving dialysis. We completed two phase 2 studies in 2012. Phase 3 initiation is planned in 2013. AMG 747 AMG 747 is a small molecule inhibitor of glycine transporter type-1 (GlyT-1). It is being investigated as a treatment for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, with two phase 2 studies initiated in 2012. Blinatumomab Blinatumomab is an anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 (BiTE  ) bispecific antibody. It is being investigated as a cancer treatment. In December 2012, we reported the results from a phase 2 adult ALL relapsed refractory study at a medical meeting. Phase 2 studies in adult patients with relapsed/refractory and minimal residual disease of ALL and a phase 2 study in adult patients with NHL are ongoing. Omecamtiv mecarbil Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small molecule activator of cardiac myosin. It is being investigated for the treatment of heart failure. We are developing this product in collaboration with Cytokinetics, Inc. A phase 2 study of an intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, who are hospitalized with acute heart failure, is ongoing. Amgen Development of Biosimilars As previously announced, we are collaborating with Actavis, Inc. (formerly Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) to develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, several oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. The products our collaboration is pursuing include biosimilar versions of bevacizumab (sold by Genentech/Roche under the brand name Avastin  ), trastuzumab (sold by Genentech/Roche under the brand names Herceptin  /Herclon  ), rituximab (sold by Roche under the brand names Rituxan  /Mabthera  ) and cetuximab (sold by Eli Lilly/BMS under the brand name Erbitux  ). We are also working to develop biosimilar versions of adalimumab (sold by AbbVie under the brand name HUMIRA  ) and infliximab (sold by Janssen/Merck under the brand name REMICADE  ). Our biosimilar product candidates are in varying stages of regulatory development. We expect that any revenue contribution from these biosimilar programs, if successful, would not occur for a number of years. Phase 3 Product Candidate Program Changes As of February 10, 2012, we had 12 phase 3 programs. As of February 11, 2013, we had 14  phase 3 programs, as six programs had advanced into phase 3 trials, three programs had concluded and all rights to one program were out-licensed.

In addition, we also acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.  Kirin-Amgen, Inc. K-A is a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin. K-A develops and then out licenses to third parties certain product rights which have been transferred to this joint venture from Amgen and Kirin. K-A has given us exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. Under these agreements, we pay K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payments from K-A for milestones earned and for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. See Note 7, Related party transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. K-A has also given Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and in certain other countries and/or regions in Asia and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. K-A also gave Kirin and Amgen co-exclusive licenses to manufacture and market G-CSF, pegfilgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin in China, which Amgen subsequently assigned to Kirin, and as a result, Kirin now exclusively manufactures and markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China. Kirin markets G-CSF, pegfilgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and recombinant human erythropoietin under the brand names GRAN  /Grasin  , Neulasta  , NESP  , ROMIPLATE  and ESPO  , respectively. Under these agreements, Kirin pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Kirin also receives payments from K-A for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. K-A has also given JJ exclusive licenses to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin for all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan. K-A has also given Roche exclusive licenses to market pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in all territories not licensed to Amgen and Kirin. Under these agreements, JJ and Roche pay royalties to K-A based on product sales. Pfizer Inc. We are in a collaboration with Pfizer to co-promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada. The rights to market ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. Under the agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Amgen and Pfizer is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL, including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing and the establishment of a brand team. Amgen and Pfizer share in the agreed-upon selling and marketing expenses approved by the joint management committee. We currently pay Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. After expiration of the co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, we will be required to pay Pfizer residual royalties based on a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the current ENBREL profit share.  Effective November 1, 2016, there will be no further royalty payments.  Glaxo Group Limited We are in a collaboration with Glaxo for the commercialization of denosumab for osteoporosis indications in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (the Primary Territories). We have retained the rights to commercialize denosumab for all indications in the United States and Canada and for oncology indications in the Primary Territories. Under a related agreement, Glaxo will commercialize denosumab for all indications in countries, excluding Japan, where we did not have a commercial presence at the commencement of the agreement, including China, Brazil, India, Taiwan and South Korea (the Expansion Territories). In the Expansion Territories, Glaxo is responsible for all development and commercialization costs and will purchase denosumab from us to meet demand. We have the option of expanding our role in the commercialization of denosumab in the Primary Territories and certain of the Expansion Territories. In the Primary Territories, we share equally in the commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses, including an amount payable to us in recognition of our discovery and development of denosumab. Glaxo is also responsible for bearing a portion of the cost of certain specified development activities in the Primary Territories. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited In 2008, we entered into an arrangement with Takeda, that provided Takeda both: (i) the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 12 molecules from our portfolio across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation (collectively the Japanese market products) and (ii) the right to collaborate with us on the worldwide (outside Japan) development and commercialization of our product candidate, motesanib. The Japanese market products include Vectibix  and certain product candidates. In 2011, we announced that the motesanib pivotal phase 3 trial (MONET1) did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in overall survival. In June 2012, the parties materially modified this arrangement such that Amgen licensed all of its rights to motesanib to Takeda which now has control over the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib. AstraZeneca Plc. We are in a collaboration with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies from Amgen's clinical inflammation portfolio, including brodalumab, AMG 139, AMG 157, AMG 181 and AMG 557. The agreement covers the worldwide development and commercialization, except for certain Asian countries for brodalumab and Japan for AMG 557, that are licensed to other third parties. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 65% of related development costs for the 2012-2014 periods will be funded by AstraZeneca; thereafter, the companies will share costs equally. If approved for sale, Amgen would receive a low-single-digit royalty rate for brodalumab and a mid-single-digit royalty rate for the rest of the portfolio, after which the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration products would be shared equally. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of romosozumab. We have the rights to commercialize romosozumab for all indications in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. UCB has the rights for all EU members at the time of first regulatory approval, Australia and New Zealand. Prior to commercialization, countries that have not been initially designated will be designated to Amgen or UCB in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Generally, development costs are shared equally and we will share equally in the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses. DaVita Inc. We are in a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita that commenced January 1, 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, we will supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVita's and its affiliates' requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party. Human Resources As of December 31, 2012, Amgen had approximately 18,000 staff members. We consider our staff relations to be good.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of all of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers may regulate prices, reimbursement levels and/or access to our products to control costs or to affect levels of use. We rely in large part on the reimbursement of our principal products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in foreign countries, and a reduction in the coverage and/or reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, there is an increased focus by the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated a two percent reduction in government payments for all Medicare services (including the administration of separately-billable drugs and payment for drugs in all Medicare programs) for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021. This payment sequestration is currently scheduled to begin in 2013 and continue through 2021. The sequestration remains subject to administrative implementation of the Budget Control Act or future statutory revision by Congress, who could block, limit or otherwise modify the automatic spending cuts. Several alternative deficit reduction proposals have been put forth by President Obama and/or Congressional committees, including proposals designed to further limit federal healthcare expenditures. While we cannot predict whether any deficit reduction actions will be approved by Congress and/or whether a budget sequestration will ultimately occur for Medicare services, a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement for drugs and biologics for U.S. healthcare programs as a result of changes such as those that have been proposed or from other changes designed to achieve similar federal budget savings could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. In March 2010 the United States adopted significant healthcare reform through the enactment of the PPACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement  U.S. Healthcare Reform.) A major goal of the healthcare reform law is to provide greater access to healthcare coverage for more Americans. Accordingly, the healthcare reform law requires individual U.S. citizens and legal residents to maintain qualifying health coverage, imposes certain requirements on employers with respect to offering health coverage to employees, amends insurance regulations regarding when coverage can be provided and denied to individuals, and expands existing government healthcare coverage programs to more individuals in more situations, with most of these changes going into effect by January 2014. We do not expect a significant increase in sales of our products as a result of the 2014 expansions in healthcare coverage. While we cannot fully predict the ultimate impact the healthcare reform law will have on us, or how the law may change due to statutory revision or judicial review, we expect that the new law will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Public and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from the U.S. federal government under Medicare Part B coverage. Any deterioration in the timeliness or certainty of payment by Medicare to physicians, including as a result of changes in policy or regulations, or as a result of operational difficulties, could negatively impact the willingness of physicians to prescribe our products for patients relying on Medicare for their medical coverage. Most of our products furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in both a physician office setting and hospital outpatient setting are reimbursed under the Medicare Part B ASP payment methodology. (See Item1. Business  Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products.) ASP- based reimbursements of products under Medicare may be below or could fall below the cost that some medical providers pay for such products, which could materially and adversely affect sales of our products. Private payers also continue to seek to reduce their costs. Insurance plans administered by private companies frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. Consolidation among managed care organizations may increase the negotiating power of these entities, potentially resulting in lower reimbursement rates for our products. Private third-party payers increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion and/or favorable formulary positioning. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly adopting utilization management tools, such as prior authorization in order to limit payment to uses of the product that are in accordance with the FDA approved labeling or step therapy to ensure that payment for a branded product is only made if the patient has first failed a cheaper generic product. Consistent with recent healthcare reforms, we anticipate that future trends will include greater reliance upon comparative effectiveness to make formulary decisions. Additionally, private payers are experimenting with new models of payment whereby reimbursement for health care providers may be linked to bundled or capitated payments. Under these payment systems, providers would get a fixed payment amount to cover a broad range of products and services provided to each patient and would be significantly incentivized to utilize the lowest cost product or service, regardless of its overall benefit to the patient, or to minimize the provision of services. To the extent that such changes affect the price we receive for our products or the level of coverage and reimbursement available when healthcare providers prescribe our products, they could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.  We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the U.S. reimbursement of and discounts for our products. ASP data are calculated by the manufacturer based on a formula defined by statute and regulation and are then submitted to CMS. CMS uses those ASP data to determine the applicable reimbursement rates for our products under Medicare Part B. However, the statute, regulations and CMS guidance do not define specific methodologies for all aspects of the reporting of ASP data. For example, CMS has not provided specific guidance regarding the treatment of bundled sale arrangements or administrative fees paid to Group Purchasing Organizations in the ASP calculation. CMS directs that manufacturers make reasonable assumptions in their calculation of ASP data in the absence of specific CMS guidance on a topic, and requires that any such reasonable assumptions be consistent with the general requirements and the intent of the Medicare statute, federal regulations and the manufacturer's customary business practices. As a result, we are required to apply our reasonable judgment to certain aspects of calculating ASP data. We also submit AMP and BP data to the government on a periodic basis. The formulas for those price figures also are defined by statute and regulation and CMS similarly has directed manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions in the absence of specific guidance on a topic relating to the calculation of those pricing figures. We are also required to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs, when our products are paid for by Medicaid, at a rate of 23.1% of the product's AMP, or if it is greater, the difference between the product's AMP and the BP, subject to various adjustments. The AMP and BP regulations require a manufacturer to update previously submitted data for a period not to exceed three years. Our ASP, AMP, and BP data calculations are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported ASP, AMP, and BP data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions, and/or underlying data. If our submitted ASP, AMP, or BP data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our calculations of AMP and/or BP are incorrect, we also may be required to make additional rebate payments to state Medicaid programs. In addition, the PPACA revised the definition of AMP, effective with submissions for the fourth quarter 2010, and in February 2012 CMS issued a proposed rule further clarifying the new AMP definition and other aspects of the AMP and BP calculations, and subsequently accepted public comments on the proposed rule. Until that rule is final, which is expected to occur later in 2013, we will be required to apply our reasonable judgment in certain aspects of the AMP and BP calculations. A significant change in the final rule regarding the AMP definition or the AMP and BP calculations could require us to pay higher rebates to state Medicaid programs in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Other initiatives reviewing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement rates. For example, in July 2007, CMS issued an NCD where it determined that ESA treatment was not reasonable and necessary for certain clinical conditions and established Medicare coverage parameters for the FDA-approved ESA use in oncology. Generally, an NCD is a national policy statement granting, limiting or excluding Medicare coverage or reimbursement for a specific medical item or service. We believe the restrictions in the 2007 NCD changed the way ESAs are used in clinical practice, for example, by decreasing the number of treated patients, the average ESA dose and the duration of ESA therapy in the oncology setting.  As a result, we believe these restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the use, reimbursement and sales of Aranesp  , which in turn had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The reimbursement of ESAs in the nephrology setting has also been reviewed by CMS. On June 16, 2010, CMS opened an NCA to examine the use of ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Following further analysis, on June 16, 2011, CMS issued a FDM in which it determined that it would not issue an NCD at that time for ESAs for treatment of anemia in adults with CKD. In the absence of an NCD, Medicare determinations are made by regional MACs, three of which have issued revised LCDs relating to anemia in patients with CKD not on dialysis. All of the revised LCDs restrict reimbursement of ESAs to use in accordance with the revised FDA label. Other MACs could also issue LCDs that similarly or further restrict reimbursement for ESAs in this setting, and physician behavior may change to be consistent with the revised label even before formal LCDs are implemented, all of which could have a further material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp  . Additionally, CMS could still further review or change the reimbursement of ESAs in the nephrology setting at some point in the future and/or propose an NCD for ESAs or other drug topics that could result in less extensive coverage for our products. For example, CMS periodically identifies topics for potential future NCDs, and while there were no drug products included on the 2012 CMS topic list, in prior years that list has included the category of thrombopoiesis stimulating agents (platelet growth factors), the category of drugs that includes Nplate  . In the dialysis setting, the reimbursement rates for our products are also subject to downward pressure. In the United States, dialysis providers are reimbursed for EPOGEN  primarily by the federal government through Medicare's ESRD Program. (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement  Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Dialysis Reimbursement.) Until January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed for separately billable dialysis drugs (including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  ) administered in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers at ASP +6%, using the same ASP payment amount methodology used in the physician clinic setting under Part B. On January 1, 2011, CMS's bundled-payment system went into effect for dialysis providers which provides a single payment for all dialysis services including drugs, supplies, and non-routine laboratory tests that were previously reimbursed separately. On November 1, 2011, following our June 2011 announcement of changes to the labels for the use of ESAs in patients with CKD (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products  ESAs), CMS finalized a rule to update various provisions of its bundled-payment system for dialysis services and the related ESRD QIP. The final rule eliminated for payment year 2013 and beyond one of the QIP's measures which tracks the percent of a provider's Medicare patients with an Hb level below 10 g/dL. (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement - Reimbursement of Our Principal Products  Dialysis Reimbursement.) CMS indicated that removal of this quality measure from the QIP was being done in response to the June 2011 ESA label changes. We believe that the implementation of these various changes in the dialysis setting has resulted and may continue to result in a material adverse impact on the reimbursement, use and sales of EPOGEN  and on our business and results of operations. Under the ATRA enacted in January 2013, CMS was directed to reduce the ESRD payment bundle amount effective January 1, 2014 to account for changes in the utilization of drugs and biologics (including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  ) since the bundle was first implemented in 2011. Oral drugs without intravenous equivalents, such as Sensipar  and phosphate binders, will continue to be reimbursed separately under the Medicare Part D benefit until they are included in the bundled-payment system in 2016. However, efforts are underway to get Congress to repeal the provision of the ATRA that postponed the entry of these oral-only drugs into the bundled-payment system; if such efforts are successful, these oral drugs could enter into the bundled-payment system before 2016. Inclusion in the bundled-payment system may reduce utilization of these oral drugs and have an adverse impact on our sales. The government-sponsored healthcare systems in Europe and many other foreign countries are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including payment for drugs and biologics, in those regions. Mandatory price controls continue to be a significant aspect of business for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries outside the United States. Healthcare reform and related legislative proposals in France, Germany and Poland, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, clawbacks of payments made to companies when drug spending thresholds are exceeded, preferences for biosimilars, changes in international price referencing, price transparency to achieve prices similar to those in lower-priced countries, and reductions in the amount of reimbursement, sometimes with the imposition of patient copayments. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to reward new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies or the speed with which they make approval or reimbursement decisions. The proliferation of HTA organizations (e.g., NICE in the UK and IQWiG in Germany) has led to determinations of coverage and reimbursement based on both the clinical as well as the economic value of a product; these agencies are also increasingly setting the maximum price at which products will be reimbursed. While we cannot fully predict the extent of further price reductions and/or reimbursement restrictions taken by governmental payers outside the United States or the impact such actions will have on our business, such reductions in price and/or the coverage and reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additional initiatives addressing the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement, which could negatively affect sales of our products. If, for any of these or other reasons, reimbursement rates are reduced, or if healthcare providers anticipate reimbursement being reduced, providers may narrow the circumstances in which they prescribe or administer our products, which could reduce the use and/or sales of our products. A reduction in the use and sales of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. For example, the 2007 creation of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) significantly added to the FDA's authority, allowing the FDA to (i) require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies; (ii) mandate labeling changes to products and (iii) require sponsors to implement a REMS for a product. Failure to comply with FDAAA requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased product liability risk. In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulatory authorities to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the burden on sponsor companies in terms of adverse event management and reporting and safety data analyses. As with FDAAA, failure to comply with the new EU pharmacovigilance legislation could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. For example, in October 2009 we received Complete Response Letters from the FDA for the BLA for Prolia  in the treatment and prevention of PMO and in the treatment and prevention of bone loss due to hormone ablation therapy (HALT) in breast and prostate cancer patients. The Complete Response Letter related to the PMO indication requested several items, including further information on the design of our previously submitted post-marketing surveillance program. The FDA also requested a new clinical program to support the approval of Prolia  for the prevention of PMO, updated safety data and stated that a REMS is necessary for Prolia  . The Complete Response Letter related to the HALT indication requested additional information regarding the safety of Prolia  in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy and patients with prostate cancer receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy. The FDA specifically requested results from additional adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating that Prolia  has no detrimental effects on either time to disease progression or overall survival. Following the submission of further information, including clinical trial data from a number of trials evaluating denosumab in various oncology indications, in September 2011 the FDA approved Prolia  as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, there may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of six products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. (See Item 1. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates  Amgen Development of Biosimilars.) In many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the U.S. healthcare reform law provided for such a pathway; while the FDA is working to establish regulations to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. Vectibix  , for example, received accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the EU, with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix  as a therapy in treating mCRC. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products  Other Marketed Products  Vectibix  (panitumumab).) If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products' accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product in connection with a renewal assessment, our conditional approval may not be renewed or we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products' labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Following recent FDA and FDA advisory committee discussions and actions with respect to other therapeutic oncology products previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA, questions remain about regulatory authorities' views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. A number of our products and product candidates have used endpoints other than overall survival, such as progression-free survival and bone-metastasis-free survival (BMFS), in clinical trials. The use of endpoints such as progression-free survival or BMFS, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. For example, our pivotal phase 3 Study '147 evaluated XGEVA  for its ability to improve BMFS in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has not yet spread to bone. The '147 trial demonstrated that XGEVA  significantly improved median bone metastasis-free survival by 4.2 months compared to placebo and significantly prolonged median time to first bone metastases. However, overall survival (a secondary endpoint) was similar between the XGEVA  and placebo arms. On February 8, 2012, the FDA convened the ODAC to discuss our sBLA filing for XGEVA  to delay bone metastases in prostate cancer. During its presentation to the ODAC, the FDA questioned the magnitude of the improvement in BMFS demonstrated in Study '147, and indicated that a further clinical trial might help address some of the remaining unresolved questions regarding the clinical significance of the benefit achieved by XGEVA  in this setting. The ODAC panel concluded that the magnitude of benefit demonstrated with early treatment with XGEVA  to delay bone metastases was not sufficient to conclude a positive risk-benefit ratio for XGEVA  in the absence of additional measures impacting quality of life or other disease outcomes. On April 26, 2012, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter to us citing the same conclusion. In addition to the clinical trials that we choose to or are required to conduct, other organizations may also conduct clinical trials that use our products. Such clinical trials may evaluate our products in areas in which we do not have and are not seeking an approved indication. However, negative results or safety signals arising in other organizations' clinical trials may nonetheless prompt regulatory agencies to take regulatory actions that affect our approved indications, including requiring the addition of relevant safety data to the approved labeling or even withdrawing approval for our products. The occurrence of a number of high profile safety events has caused an increased public and governmental concern about potential safety issues relating to pharmaceutical and biological products and certain of our products and product candidates. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) As a result of this increased concern in recent years, the U.S. regulatory environment has evolved and safety signals and safety concerns resulting from preclinical data, clinical trials (including sub-analyses and meta-analyses), market use or other sources are receiving greater scrutiny. For example, a number of regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA and the EMA, have initiated programs to directly monitor for safety issues rather than wait for patients, providers or manufacturers to report safety problems with products or medical devices. And at least one private, for-profit company has begun aggregating and analyzing FDA adverse event data on its website using its own independent methodology, which could highlight new perceived risks of our products and product candidates. We are required to communicate to regulatory agencies adverse events reported to us by patients taking our products. Regulatory agencies may periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. If regulatory agencies determine that we have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines and other penalties. Actual or perceived safety problems or signals could lead to revised or restrictive labeling of our approved products or a class of products, potentially including limitations on the use of approved products in certain patients because of: ##TABLE_START  the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns with respect to any of our products by regulatory agencies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  an increased rate or number of previously-identified safety-related events; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related to results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, or meta-analysis (a meta-analysis is the review of studies using various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) of clinical trials or clinical data performed by us or others; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new legislation or rules by regulatory agencies. ##TABLE_END For example, in December 2009, based on the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp  Therapy (TREAT) results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. In October 2010, we submitted additional proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In June 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved further changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp  and EPOGEN  , in patients with CKD. (With the June 2011 label changes, the FDA changed the term CRF to CKD in the ESA labels. We use CRF when referring to labels prior to June 2011 for historical accuracy.) See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. In addition to revised labeling for our products, discovery of new safety information or previously unknown safety concerns and/or safety signals with our products or similar products could also lead to: ##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) or other FDA compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  mandated PMCs/PMRs or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. ##TABLE_END Product safety concerns could cause regulatory agencies to impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS), which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop, implement and administer. The results of these risk management activities could: ##TABLE_START  impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  limit patient access to our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reduce patient willingness to use our products; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  place administrative burdens on healthcare providers in prescribing our products; and/or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS or similar risk management activities. ##TABLE_END We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  and Nplate  , and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of our REMS that include elements to assure safe use. For example, our ESA REMS requires applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS and providing the FDA with periodic assessment reports to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. The FDA may modify our REMS based on the results of the periodic assessment reports. Also, if we or third-party service providers acting on our behalf fail to effectively implement and/or administer the REMS for our products, we may be required to modify such REMS, and we may be subject to FDA enforcement actions or to civil penalties. Further, if new medical data or product quality issues suggest an unacceptable or potential safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may withdraw some or all affected product-either voluntarily or by regulatory mandate-in certain therapeutic areas, or completely recall a product presentation from the market for some period or permanently. For example, in September 2009, we initiated a voluntary recall of a limited number of ENBREL SureClick  lots due to a defect in the glass syringe barrel which resulted in a small number of broken syringes following assembly of the autoinjector device. In October 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of ENBREL due to identification of cracks in a small number of the glass syringes which may have resulted in product leakage and syringe breakage. Further, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN  and JJ voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT  , manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close cooperation with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products, which may materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, if we or other parties (including our independent clinical trial investigators or our licensees, such as JJ, Pfizer, Glaxo and Takeda) report or fail to effectively report to regulatory agencies side effects or other safety concerns that occur from their use of our products in clinical trials or studies or from marketed use, resulting regulatory action, including monetary fines and other penalties, could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) As more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generic or biosimilars, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Additionally, as a result of the current or a future global economic downturn, our third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government and/or private payer healthcare programs or increased competition from lower cost biosimilars could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of the economic conditions and/or employer decisions regarding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the United States in 2014, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients' ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, the economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. In Europe, economic conditions across the region could potentially be impacted by countries of key concern, particularly countries in Southern Europe. Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including drugs and biologics. In Southern Europe, credit and economic conditions have adversely impacted the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. Global economic conditions may continue to impact the average length of time it takes to collect payments in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal or other countries, or we may never collect some or all of these receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. See  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices which have their own regulatory, manufacturing, reimbursement and other risks. Some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such drug delivery devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. Where approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these drug delivery devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain that approval or clearance once it has been received. Failure to supply the devices, delays in or failure of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of the third-party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Similarly, some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with an in vitro companion diagnostic device, such as a test kit. In some cases, our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. For example, the FDA has informed us that its approval of Vectibix  for the first- and second-line mCRC indications we are seeking will be contingent upon approval of the companion diagnostic device being developed in collaboration with QIAGEN, which identifies a patient's KRAS gene status. As with drug delivery devices used with our products, our ability to get and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products or product candidates used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices can be substantially dependent on whether the manufacturers of such devices meet their contractual responsibilities to us and/or their obligations to regulatory authorities. Failures by these manufacturers can also result in the significant delays and added costs described above, or even result in the removal of our product from the market. The in vitro companion diagnostic and drug delivery devices used with our products are also subject to many of the same reimbursement risks and challenges to which our products are subject. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) A reduction in the availability of, or the coverage and/or reimbursement for, in vitro companion diagnostic or drug delivery devices used with our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities. Beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and other agencies. In the United States, over this time frame the FDA has reviewed the benefit-risk profile of ESAs, which has resulted in changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. Over this same time period, CMS has also evaluated the use of ESAs and has made substantial reimbursement changes in the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) Together, these labeling and reimbursement changes, along with the approved REMS for ESAs, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations, and further labeling or reimbursement changes by these regulatory authorities could increase the severity of that effect. We have also agreed with the FDA to conduct a number of PMCs for our ESAs. In 2004, we agreed with the FDA to a robust pharmacovigilance program to continue to study the safety surrounding the use of darbepoetin alfa in the oncology setting. Of the five studies originally included in that pharmacovigilance program, four are complete and analysis of the results from the fifth study, LHN03-6B, is currently ongoing. The results of certain of those studies contributed to safety-related product labeling changes for our ESAs and changes in reimbursement, as noted above. Other trials have subsequently been initiated to inform on the safety of ESAs. In 2009 we initiated Study '782, a phase 3 non-inferiority study evaluating overall survival when comparing NSCLC patients on Aranesp  to patients receiving placebo, as part of our Aranesp  pharmacovigilance program. In addition, JRD's EPO-ANE-3010 study, which evaluates the use of epoetin alfa in patients with breast cancer, is ongoing. Both of these studies are designated by the FDA as PMRs and must be conducted to maintain regulatory approval and marketing authorization. For the nephrology setting, we have been engaged in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding additional PMRs to explore alternative ESA dosing strategies in CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. In July 2012 we initiated study '226 to evaluate Aranesp  use in CKD patients not on dialysis. We expect to discuss further with the FDA another potential study in CKD patients on dialysis. Although we cannot predict the results or the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials, or the extent to which regulatory authorities may require additional labeling changes as a result of these or other trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that unfavorable results from clinical trials, including PMCs, could have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs and on our business and results of operations.  Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also reviewed and scrutinized the use of ESAs. In June 2008, the EMA recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients, which was approved by the EC in October 2008. Following the October 2008 revision, we experienced a reduction of Aranesp  sales in the supportive cancer care setting in the EU. In addition, following the June 2011 ESA label changes in the United States, regulatory agencies outside the United States have sought additional information from us about the use and safety of ESAs in the CKD setting. Additional labeling or reimbursement changes by these regulatory authorities could materially and adversely affect the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs, including PMCs. For example, in May 2009, the Cochrane Collaboration published its independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we submitted to the FDA and the EMA. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient-level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion, but they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. In addition, in January 2013 we announced data from the RED-HF  trial evaluating the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the composite endpoint of time to death from any cause or first hospital admission for worsening heart failure. While there were no new safety findings identified in the RED-HF  trial, unfavorable results from similar trials or meta-analyses of previous clinical trials could materially and adversely affect the use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. We may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting similar clinical trials in certain patient populations. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatorily diverse clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additional information on our clinical trials can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations in the RD of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site, not approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products' relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis, if at all. Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators' clinical trials which could: ##TABLE_START  delay the clinical trial program; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  require additional or longer trials to gain approval; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our drugs or similar products that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use and sales of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, we initiated Study '782 as part of our Aranesp  oncology pharmacovigilance program. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) In connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilars, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. In 2010, lawmakers in the United States enacted healthcare reform legislation which included an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. The EU is already approving biosimilars under such a regulatory pathway. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost generic or biosimilars that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2006, the EMA developed and issued regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilars. The guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilars, including erythropoietins and G-CSFs, recommending that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilars conduct pharmacodynamic, toxicological and clinical safety studies as well as a pharmacovigilance program. Some companies have received and other companies are seeking approval to market erythropoietin and G-CSF biosimilars in the EU, presenting additional competition for our products. (See Our marketed products face substantial competition.) For example, following the expiration of the principal European patent relating to recombinant G-CSF in August 2006, the EC issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilars and the products were launched in certain EU countries in 2008 and 2009. There are now several G-CSF biosimilars available in the EU marketed by different companies and these G-CSF biosimilars compete with NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . In December 2012, EMA guidelines on the approval process for monoclonal antibody biosimilars became effective. In an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential health care savings, countries in the EU may adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the United States, with the adoption of the healthcare reform law the FDA was authorized to approve biosimilars under a separate, abbreviated pathway. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) The law established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlined statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovator's regulatory application by prohibiting, for a period of 12 years, others from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance or reference to the innovator's data in their application to the FDA. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. On February 9, 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents that provide insight into the FDA's current thinking on the development of biosimilars and broad parameters for the scientific assessment of biosimilar applications. The documents provide guidance in the development of biosimilar versions of currently approved biological products and indicate that the clinical trials and other steps required for approval of each biosimilar will depend on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the protein, the degree of analytical similarity with the reference product and the potential risks of the product. A growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including a number of our products. Further, biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to obtain U.S. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period. President Obama's proposed 2013 budget included a proposal to lower the data exclusivity period to seven years, but this would require new legislation be passed by Congress. Critics may also encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our products, or the degree to which the FDA's 2012 biosimilar guidelines will contribute to that impact, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. (See Item 7A. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. With respect to the biosimilars we are working to develop (see Item 1. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates  Amgen Development of Biosimilars), a number of other companies have announced their intention to develop biosimilar versions of the same reference products that we are pursuing. Some of these companies may be ahead of us in their biosimilar development timelines, have certain technical or other advantages over us or have more experience producing or marketing generic or biosimilar products. Even if we are able to successfully get our biosimilar product candidates approved by regulatory authorities, this additional competition could limit the ability of our biosimilars to gain market acceptance with prescribers or payors or otherwise affect the sales of our biosimilars. We may not be able to develop commercial products. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant RD investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite bioequivalence to the applicable reference product, or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purposes of safety or efficacy, to gain approval under the biosimilar pathway; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined. ##TABLE_END Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The conclusion was reached even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson's disease patients. Subsequently, we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. Our marketed products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products.  In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices (including new generics or biosimilars that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection), equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer, achieve earlier entry into the market or that are otherwise competitive with our products . Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts, fines, penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government, 49 states and the District of Columbia to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices arising out of ongoing civil and criminal investigations conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the Western District of Washington (the Federal Investigations). As more fully described in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, this settlement resolved the Federal Investigations, the related state Medicaid claims (except for those of the State of South Carolina) and the claims of ten civil qui tam actions that had been pending against us. However, the settlement does not resolve certain of other litigation matters that will continue to be pending against us, and we may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. We may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components. ##TABLE_END These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Nplate  , XGEVA  and Vectibix  and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START  availability or contamination of raw materials, components and equipment used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  contamination by microorganisms or viruses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  degree of compliance with regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in forecasts of future demand; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  timing and actual number of production runs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  updating of manufacturing specifications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  production success rates and yields; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  timing and outcome of product quality testing. ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.  We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  , all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN  material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA  at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including: ##TABLE_START  power failures and/or other utility failures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  improper installation or operation of equipment; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA. ##TABLE_END In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and such losses could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of ENBREL and EPOGEN  voluntarily recalled in 2009 and 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. For example, until the Pennsylvania District Court entered final judgment and a permanent injunction against Teva on July 15, 2011 pursuant to a joint stipulation and settlement agreement between the parties, Teva had announced that it intended to sell its filgrastim product, upon approval from the FDA, in the United States without a license from us and prior to the expiration of our G-CSF patents. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Over the next several years, certain of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. (See Item 7A. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) We have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. For example, there are a number of competing therapies currently on the market and more in clinical development that are different from ENBREL but are used to treat the same inflammatory diseases treated by ENBREL. Although we continue to develop new products, and obtain patent protection for these new product candidates, we may not be able to replace the revenue lost upon the expiration of the patents on our current products. From time to time, U.S. and other policymakers have proposed reforming the patent laws and regulations of their countries. In September 2011, after years of Congressional debate regarding patent reform legislation, President Obama signed into law the America Invents Act (the Act) considered by many to be the most substantial revision of U.S. patent law since 1952. The Act's various provisions take effect over an 18-month period. The Act changes the current first-to-invent system to a system that awards a patent to the first-inventor-to-file for an application for a patentable invention. This change alters the pool of available materials that can be used to challenge patents and eliminates the ability to rely on prior research work in order to lay claim to patent rights. Disputes as to whether the first filer is in fact the true inventor will be resolved through newly implemented derivation proceedings. The Act also creates mechanisms to allow challenges to newly issued patents in the patent office in post-grant proceedings and new inter partes reexamination proceedings. Although many of the changes bring U.S. law into closer harmony with European and other national patent laws, the new bases and procedures may make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents, which could result in increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The changes may also make it harder to challenge third-party patents and place greater importance on being the first inventor to file a patent application on an invention. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, HTA organizations, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients, healthcare providers and payers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include: ##TABLE_START  In August 2012, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO), a not-for-profit foundation managed by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), published its updated global anemia guidelines in light of new study results, particularly the data from the TREAT trial, which had become available since the NKF-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI  ) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD were released in 2007. The new guidelines recommend, among other things, that ESAs not be used to maintain Hb concentrations above 11.5 g/dL in adult patients with CKD. KDOQI has announced that it is preparing a U.S. commentary on the KDIGO global anemia guidelines which is expected to be released in 2013. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In April 2012, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a review in which it identified the top five opportunities to improve the quality and value of cancer care by curbing use of common tests and treatments that are not supported by clinical evidence. Among ASCO's suggestions in this review was that oncologists should avoid administering white blood cell stimulating factors (such as NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  ) to patients who have a very low risk for febrile neutropenia, a position consistent with ASCO's existing guidelines for the use of white blood cell stimulating factors. ##TABLE_END In addition, HTA organizations, such as NICE in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business  Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected. Our risk mitigation measures and corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In addition, our business is complex and involves significant operational risks. While we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. Further, we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations. The corporate integrity agreement requires us to make periodic attestations that we are implementing and following the provisions of the corporate integrity agreement, and provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the corporate integrity agreement. If we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations, laws and/or requirements of the corporate integrity agreement, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Cost savings initiatives may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred. Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those efforts, we undertake cost savings initiatives to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these cost savings initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We believe our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of income earned outside the United States, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress and the Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the United States, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock. Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. In addition, in December 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the total authorization for repurchases of our common stock in the amount of $2 billion. This amount was in addition to the approximately $0.5 billion then remaining under the existing stock repurchase authorization. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have in the past experienced cyber attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Such acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire, including their personnel, technology, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Stock repurchase program The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, we had one outstanding stock repurchase program. Our repurchase activity for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, was as follows: ##TABLE_START   Total number of shares purchased  Average price paid per share (1)  Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program  Maximum dollar value that may yet be purchased under the program (2) October 1 - October 31  2,215,600  $ 86.39  2,215,600  $ 1,372,784,941 November 1 - November 30  7,723,400  85.72  7,723,400  710,747,356 December 1 - December 31  4,304,000  88.16  4,304,000  2,331,298,539   14,243,000  86.56  14,243,000   January 1 - December 31  62,334,610  $ 74.79  62,334,610   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Average price paid per share includes related expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  On October 13, 2011, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchase of our common stock to an aggregate of $10 billion.

Additionally, on December 13, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock, which will be paid on March 7, 2013. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although the amount and timing of any future dividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " Item 6.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We are a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. Our medicines help millions of patients in the fight against cancer, kidney disease, RA, bone disease and other serious illnesses. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Our principal products include Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , XGEVA  and Prolia  . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business  Marketed Products. In 2012, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving 11% revenue growth driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 9% in the United States and 7% in the ROW. We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2012, and in December, we declared a dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock payable in March 2013, representing a 31% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. Additionally, we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion in 2012. Under our $10 billion authorized stock repurchase program announced in October 2011, we have repurchased a total of 146 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $9.7 billion at an average price of $66.37. Finally, we made significant advances in our product pipeline in 2012 including advancing AMG 145, brodalumab, romosozumab and rilotumumab to phase 3 clinical trials. We enter 2013 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA  and Prolia  represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our later stage pipeline, by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Micromet and MN in 2012. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. In the United States, ENBREL, EPOGEN  and XGEVA  , in particular, will be facing increased competition. Additionally, over the next several years, starting in 2013, certain of the existing patents on our principal products  including NEUPOGEN  , EPOGEN  and Aranesp   will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. For additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents for various products, see Item 1. Business  Marketed Products. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce health care costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of the economic condition, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy before and after products have been launched. Finally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period.  While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START   Change  Product sales:      U.S. $ 12,815  %  $ 11,725 ROW 3,824  %  3,570 Total product sales 16,639  %  15,295 Other revenues  *  Total revenues $ 17,265  %  $ 15,582 Operating expenses $ 11,688  %  $ 11,270 Operating income $ 5,577  %  $ 4,312 Net income $ 4,345  %  $ 3,683 Diluted EPS $ 5.52  %  $ 4.04 Diluted shares  (14 )%  ##TABLE_END* Change in excess of 100% When discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2012 reflects growth across the portfolio except ESAs, which declined 10%. Excluding ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 16% driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. The increase in ROW product sales for 2012 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp  , which declined 4%, and combined Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  , which declined 9%. The increase in other revenues for 2012 was driven by a modification to our Takeda collaboration, which replaced a global co-development and profit share agreement for motesanib, originally signed in 2008, with an exclusive license for Takeda to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. That modification resulted in revenue recognition of $232 million. The increase also reflects milestone payments received from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. Operating expenses in 2011 included a previously disclosed charge for a legal settlement reserve of $780 million. The increase in net income for 2012 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, and higher effective income tax rates. The increase in diluted EPS for 2012 was driven primarily by increases in net income and by the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax in 2012 , cost of sales increased by $343 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $337 million and EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.01. In 2011, cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12. As of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $24.1 billion, and total debt outstanding was $26.5 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2012 , approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.

The decrease in ROW Neulasta  sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe and a decrease in the average net sales price. The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe. The increase in U.S. Neulasta  sales for 2011 was driven by increases in both unit demand and the average net sales price. The increase in ROW Neulasta  sales for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in unit demand. The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales for 2011 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a decrease in unit demand. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN  sales for 2011 was driven by a decrease in unit demand, in part, from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe, and a decrease in the average net sales price. Our outstanding material U.S. patents for Filgrastim (NEUPOGEN  ) expire in December 2013. We expect to face competition in the United States beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN  and, in turn, Neulasta  . See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of the potential impact of patent expiration. Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) expires in 2015. Future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START    Change   Change  ENBREL  U.S.  $ 3,967  %  $ 3,458  %  $ 3,304 ENBREL  Canada   %   %  Total ENBREL  $ 4,236  %  $ 3,701  %  $ 3,534 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in ENBREL sales for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL also faces increased competition. See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  Aranesp   U.S. $  (21 )%  $  (11 )%  $ 1,103 Aranesp   ROW 1,258  (4 )%  1,317  (5 )%  1,383 Total Aranesp  $ 2,040  (11 )%  $ 2,303  (7 )%  $ 2,486 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2012 was driven by a decline in unit demand. The unit decline reflects changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011 (2011 changes). The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price. Sequentially, global Aranesp  unit demand was down 5% in the quarter ended December 31, 2012, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2012. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2011 was driven primarily by a decline in unit demand due to the impact of the 2011 changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2011 was due to a decrease in the average net sales price and a unit decline, reflecting segment contraction. EPOGEN   Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  EPOGEN   U.S. $ 1,941  (5 )%  $ 2,040  (19 )%  $ 2,524 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by a 23% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. This decrease was offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $96 million. The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand due to the impact of the 2011 changes, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and patient population growth. Future EPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START  increased competition in the U.S. dialysis setting; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new or amended contracts with dialysis centers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CKD. ##TABLE_END XGEVA  and Prolia   Total XGEVA  and total Prolia  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  XGEVA   U.S. $  %  $  *  $ XGEVA   ROW  *   N/A   Total XGEVA   *  *  Prolia   U.S.  *   *  Prolia   ROW  *   *  Total Prolia   *   *  Total XGEVA  /Prolia  $ 1,220  *  $  *  $ ##TABLE_END* Change in excess of 100% The increases in global XGEVA  and Prolia  sales for 2012 and 2011 were driven primarily by unit growth.

Excluding the impacts of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.5% and 14.5% of product sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cost of sales increased to 15.9% of product sales for 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. The decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party RD arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description Discovery Research and Translational Sciences  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Discovery Research and Translational Sciences $ 1,137  $ 1,125  $ 1,154 Later stage clinical programs 1,285   Marketed products  1,059  Total RD expense $ 3,380  $ 3,167  $ 2,894 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in RD expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including AMG 145 and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million. The increase in RD expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support driven largely by our continued support for Prolia  and XGEVA  which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia  and XGEVA  as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to RD technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SGA expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SGA expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. The increase in SGA expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion of $87 million, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee. The increase in SGA expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform estimated federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia  and XGEVA  and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,495 million, $1,288 million and $1,184 million, respectively. Other Other operating expenses for 2012 included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $175 million, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal proceedings charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to a prior-year business combination. Other operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and certain charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million. In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START    Interest expense, net $ 1,053  $  $ Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provisions for income taxes $  $  $ Effective tax rate 13.3 %  11.3 %  13.0 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net Included in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $140 million, $143 million and $266 million, respectively, on our convertible debt. The increase of interest expense in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments. The increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal RD tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. Because the ATRA of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act which will retroactively benefit the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the reinstatement of the RD tax credit for 2012, cannot be recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in the company's 2013 financial results for the first quarter. The tax benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 RD tax credit that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 is approximately $65 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, we also settled the examination of our U.S. tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service relating to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009. We will recognize the tax impact of this settlement in the first quarter of 2013. We expect the settlement to result in a tax benefit of approximately $185 million. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years' non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 18.7% and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 24,061  $ 20,641 Total assets 54,298  48,871 Current portion of long-term debt 2,495  Long-term debt 24,034  21,344 Stockholders equity 19,060  19,029 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). During 2011, we repurchased a total of 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion. In October 2011, we announced our intent to accelerate our repurchase program and that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program to $10 billion. Subsequent to this authorization through December 31, 2011, we repurchased 83 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. During 2012 , we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion. This brings the total of shares repurchased under this approved $10 billion authorization to 146 million at a total cost of $9.7 billion at an average cost of $66.37 per share. In December 2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion, and as of December 31, 2012 , $2.3  billion remained available under this stock repurchase program, which is expected to cover our share repurchase activity into 2014. In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes  $99 million of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed by the original terms of the no tes, which was offset by the receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these convertible notes. In April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. In December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $ 1.1 billion in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.47 per share of common stock, payable in March 2013. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2012 , accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $400 million, of which $281 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Over the next several years, certain of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars, which may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. In the EU, there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under a new, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. Business  Marketed Products.) In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe that may seek to obtain U.S. approval. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA  and Prolia  and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products' patent expiries. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2012 , approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 24.0 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011 , were $ 84 million and $ 21.3 billion, respectively. We issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2012 , including $5.0 billion, $10.5 billion and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amounts of notes in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, we repaid $ 123 million of debt, including the redemption of all of our outstanding zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032 and debt assumed in the acquisition of MN and deCODE Genetics. In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011, we had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion, which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $748 million, respectively. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2012 , we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2012 . See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows Our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,882  $ 5,119  $ 5,787 Net cash used in investing activities (9,990 )  (786 )  (4,152 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities  (674 )  (1,232 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, an increase in net income, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements of $397 million and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Cash provided by operating activities during 2011 decreased due primarily to increased interest payments, working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia  and XGEVA  and the prepayment of certain royalties. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 689 million, $ 567 million and $ 580 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 2.4 billion and $ 701 million, respectively. Net purchases of marketable securities were $ 6.9 billion for 2012 , compared to net proceeds of $ 437 million for 2011 and net purchases of $ 3.5 billion for 2010 . Financing Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 1.3 billion, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $ 4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011 , in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 , aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments due by period    Year  Years  Years  Years Contractual obligations Total   2 and 3  4 and 5  6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) $ 44,885  $ 3,601  $ 4,114  $ 6,048  $ 31,122 Operating lease obligations     Purchase obligations (3) 2,921     1,015 Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (4)          Total contractual obligations $ 48,547  $ 4,554  $ 4,982  $ 6,587  $ 32,424 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we u sed the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2012 . See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2012 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $2.5 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of January 1, 2010 $  $  $  $ Amounts charged against product sales 1,861  2,593   5,034 Payments (1,724 )  (2,548 )  (588 )  (4,860 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010    1,144 Amounts charged against product sales 1,795  2,626   5,091 Payments (1,592 )  (2,600 )  (717 )  (4,909 ) Balance as of December 31, 2011 1,047    1,326 Amounts charged against product sales 1,480  2,709   4,848 Payments (1,680 )  (2,741 )  (624 )  (5,045 ) Balance as of December 31, 2012 $  $  $  $ 1,129 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , total sales deductions were 23%, 25% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2012 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. Additionally, for Medicaid rebates, we consider the estimated patient population and the amount of unbilled managed Medicaid claims. We adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and more than one year for certain government programs. Rebate accruals totaled $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and less than 5% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2012 would have had an impact of approximately $150 million, or approximately 1% of our 2012 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Companys pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Companys operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Companys foreign income associated with the Companys operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed primarily of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, strong demand for fixed-income instruments led to continued low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during 2012. Short-term interest rates on U.S. Treasury instruments remained near historical lows due to a combination of the Federal Reserves monetary policies and the challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Continued uncertainty surrounding European sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, and we have consequently assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and additionally at December 31, 2012, other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $23.7 billion and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011, would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $26.5 billion and a fair value of $29.9 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $21.4 billion and a fair value of $23.0 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts, while outstanding, and cross-currency swap contracts. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Due to historically low interest rates, we terminated all of these swap contracts in May 2012. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $3.6 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2011. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $200 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $748 million, respectively, that hedge certain of our foreign denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in approximately a $400 million reduction in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts on this date but would have no effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in approximately a $130 million reduction in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts on this date but would have no effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with both a carrying value and fair value of $1.5 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $760 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $700 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $290 million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $710 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt. With regard to our $748 million notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in pounds sterling as of December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $210 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing year from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2012, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.7 billion and $200 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.5 billion and $292 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $730 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $350 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2011, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $330 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $629 million and $389 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2012 and 2011. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2012 and 2011, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2012 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 27, 2013 ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our or us) is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer, Amgen has grown to be the world's largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. We were incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments that occurred in 2013 and early 2014 affecting our business. Acquisition ##TABLE_START  In October 2013, we acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Onyx), a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for improving the lives of people with certain cancers. Onyx has a growing multiple myeloma franchise, with Kyprolis  (carfilzomib) for Injection already approved in the United States (U.S.), and with oprozomib being evaluated in clinical trials for patients with hematologic malignancies. In addition, Onyx has three partnered oncology assets: Nexavar  (sorafenib) tablets (an Onyx and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Bayer) compound), Stivarga  (regorafenib) tablets (a Bayer compound), and palbociclib (a Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) compound). See Note 2, Business combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow Kyprolis  . Ongoing studies to support and extend the position of Kyprolis  in multiple myeloma include: ##TABLE_START  The FOCUS trial, which could support the European Union (EU) filing for the indication of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The ASPIRE trial, which is the confirmatory trial for full U.S. approval as well as a registration-enabling study for relapsed multiple myeloma in the United States and the EU; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The ENDEAVOR trial, which compares Kyprolis  with Velcade  (bortezomib) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The CLARION trial, which compares Kyprolis  with Velcade  in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. ##TABLE_END Pipeline Evolocumab (AMG 145) ##TABLE_START  In December 2013 and January 2014, we announced results from five phase 3 lipid lowering clinical studies evaluating evolocumab as a monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in statin-intolerant subjects, and in combination with optimized lipid lowering therapy in a 52 week safety and efficacy study. All five of these studies met their primary endpoints. ##TABLE_END In a separate phase 3 study of our devices for use in combination with evolocumab, 95 percent or greater of the 164 patients enrolled were able to self-administer at least one full home administration of evolocumab 420 mg subcutaneously by one injection with an automated mini-doser or by three injections with a standard spring-based autoinjector. Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were comparable with both devices. Ivabradine ##TABLE_START  In August 2013, we obtained the commercial rights in the United States to Servier's novel oral drug ivabradine, a small molecule inhibitor of the cardiac f-current ( I f ). Ivabradine is approved in the EU and many other jurisdictions outside of the United States as Procoralan  for chronic heart failure and stable angina in patients with elevated heart rates. ##TABLE_END Talimogene Laherparepvec ##TABLE_START  In March 2013, we announced results from the phase 3 trial in melanoma, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec for the treatment of unresected stage IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma compared to treatment with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). ##TABLE_END The study met its primary endpoint of durable response rate (DRR), defined as the rate of complete or partial response lasting continuously for at least six months. A statistically significant difference was observed in DRR: 16 percent in the talimogene laherparepvec arm versus two percent in the GM-CSF arm. A pre-planned interim analysis conducted with the analysis of DRR has shown an overall survival (OS) trend in favor of talimogene laherparepvec as compared to GM-CSF. The analysis of OS, a key secondary endpoint of the study, is event driven. Trebananib ##TABLE_START  In June 2013, we announced that the phase 3 TRINOVA-1 trial evaluating trebananib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in recurrent ovarian cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). A statistically significant difference was observed in PFS with a 34 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. The median PFS was 7.2 months in the trebananib arm versus 5.4 months in the control arm. The primary analysis of the OS secondary endpoint is event driven. ##TABLE_END 2 Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products We maintain sales and marketing forces primarily in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into new geographic markets, including such countries as Japan and China. This is achieved either through building our own sales and marketing force or in partnership with third parties. See Business Relationships. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, as well as through the Internet.  See Government Regulation  Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion for a discussion of government regulation of product marketing and promotion. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors. We utilize those wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to U.S. healthcare providers. In Europe, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers, and we limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, for certain customers, may require letters of credit. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for approximately 93%, 94% and 90% of our gross product sales in the United States, respectively, and approximately 75%, 76% and 72% of our total worldwide gross revenues, respectively. For financial information related to our one business segment, see Part IV  Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Note 19, Segment information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We market our principal products primarily in the United States in cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. The following charts show our product sales by principal product and by geography for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (filgrastim) We market Neulasta  , a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, and NEUPOGEN  , a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta  was launched in 2002 and is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies. NEUPOGEN  was launched in 1991 and is approved for five different indications. It is used primarily for reducing the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever. Enbrel  (etanercept) We market ENBREL primarily in the United States. It was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in the approved indications for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: ##TABLE_START  moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  active psoriatic arthritis. ##TABLE_END The rights to market and sell ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. ESAs (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) Our ESAs include both Aranesp  and EPOGEN  . Beginning in 2006, safety concerns contributed to regulatory and reimbursement changes impacting the way ESAs are used in clinical practice. This includes decreasing the number of patients treated with ESAs as well as the average dose and duration of ESA therapy. Certain of these developments have had a material adverse impact on both Aranesp  and EPOGEN  sales. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We market Aranesp  primarily in Europe and in the United States. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) and the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa) We market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. It was launched in 1989, and we market it for the approved indication to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by CKD in patients on dialysis to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. The majority of our sales are to two large dialysis providers. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson (JJ) (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to their subsidiary, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen)), a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States in all indications other than dialysis. XGEVA  /Prolia  (denosumab) We market XGEVA  and Prolia  primarily in the United States and Europe. Both products contain the same active ingredient but are approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. XGEVA  was launched in the United States in 2010 and is indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. It is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. XGEVA  was launched in Europe in 2011 and is indicated for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. Prolia  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it has four different approved indications and is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia  is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) We market cinacalcet as Sensipar  primarily in the United States and as Mimpara  primarily in Europe. It was launched in 2004 and is used primarily in the approved indication for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis. Other Marketed Products We market several other products including Nplate  (romiplostim) and Vectibix  (panitumumab).

For example, supplementary protection certificates have been issued related to the indicated products for patents in at least the following countries: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pegfilgrastim - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  darbepoetin alfa - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2016 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  denosumab - France, Italy and Spain , expiring in 2025 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cinacalcet - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2019 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  panitumumab - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2022 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  romiplostim - France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2024 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  This formulation patent relates to the currently approved liquid formulation of ENBREL, which formulation accounts for the majority of ENBREL sales in the United States. However, ENBREL is also sold as an alternative lyophilized formulation that requires reconstituting before it can be administered to the patient. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  A patent with this subject matter may be entitled to patent term extension in the United States. ##TABLE_END Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN  ) expired in December 2013. Competition Certain of our marketed products face  and our product candidates, if approved, are also expected to face  substantial competition. Our products competitive positions among other biological and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, timing of market entry and patent position and expirations. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is biosimilar to the original reference product. See Government Regulation. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. In the EU, we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe, which may seek to obtain U.S. approval. Some of our products compete with each other. For example, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  compete in the United States, primarily in the dialysis setting. Neulasta  competes with NEUPOGEN  , as Neulasta  is administered as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle while NEUPOGEN  requires more frequent dosing. NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  , which we believe is substantially complete. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of the price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.

There is an injunction prohibiting them from commercializing in the United States until expiration of the patents. ##TABLE_END We anticipate EPOGEN  and Aranesp  may begin to face competition during the second half of 2014 from the launch of MIRCERA  in the United States. Pursuant to a December 2009 settlement agreement between Amgen and Roche, Roche is allowed to begin selling MIRCERA  in the United States in mid-2014 under terms of a limited license agreement. MIRCERA  has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure in patients on and not on dialysis. Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they use through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers. We are required to provide specified rebates or discounts to certain of these government funded programs. For many years, federal and state governments in the United States have pursued methods to reduce the cost of these programs. For example, in 2010 the United States enacted major healthcare reform legislation (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) that had significant impacts which include: an increase in the rebates we pay for our products that are covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, a requirement to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization, the expansion of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Program, and a new fee (the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee). Such changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business. At present, Medicare payment rates are affected by across-the-board federal budget cuts commonly referred to as sequestration. Under sequestration, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% beginning in 2013. In addition, in the effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, our industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. It remains uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction actions that would directly or indirectly affect us and our business. Particular legislative proposals that would have a significant impact on Amgen include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses oral-only drugs for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (including Sensipar  ) and changes in the payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs (which could impact many of our principal products, including Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  ). Efforts are also being made in the private sector to reduce healthcare costs, notably by healthcare payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue efforts to reduce the cost and/or utilization of healthcare products, including our products. Generally, in countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic reference pricing, increasing mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. In addition, healthcare reform and related legislative proposals in such countries as France, Germany and Poland, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. For example, many Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are proliferating in established and emerging markets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing The products we manufacture include both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics which are produced in living systems and are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. We perform most of our bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish activities in our Puerto Rico facility and also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers: ##TABLE_START  to manufacture Sensipar  /Mimpara  , except for certain fill and finish activities performed by us in Puerto Rico; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to supplement commercial bulk manufacturing, as needed, for ENBREL, Prolia  , XGEVA  and Vectibix  ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to fill and finish certain portions of ENBREL; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to formulate, fill and finish Nplate  . ##TABLE_END In addition, we utilize single-source third-party contract manufacturers for Kyprolis  . Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California, location. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United States  principally in Kentucky and California  and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products in certain areas of the world. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation  Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to optimize our manufacturing network and/or mitigate manufacturing risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our commercial products. The facilities impacted by these initiatives will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authorities. These initiatives include the construction of a formulation and fill facility at our Puerto Rico site; and as part of a risk mitigation strategy, we plan modification and expansion of our acquired formulation, fill and finish site in Ireland to manufacture our products. In 2013, Amgen announced a planned expansion in Singapore. The facility will initially focus on expanding Amgens capability to manufacture monoclonal antibodies while bringing new technology and innovation. Once completed, the facility will be fully reconfigurable, providing efficient manufacturing capabilities that will help ensure supply of our products to patients worldwide. In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to operate our facilities at appropriate production capacity over the next few years, to further optimize manufacturing asset utilization, to continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and to maintain a state of regulatory compliance. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development (RD) activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are very long - approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We cannot market or promote a new product until our marketing application has been approved by the FDA. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our development of commercial products. Post-approval Phase. After approval, we monitor adverse events reported following the use of our products through post marketing surveillance or studies, other research approaches and risk management activities. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required per local regulations.  We design and implement comprehensive proactive pharmacovigilance programs for all of our products to help ensure the detection, assessment and communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Failure to conduct such required trials in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Reported adverse events or data resulting from post-approval trials may result in additional limitations being placed on a products use or on reimbursement provided by payers for our products, or withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. The FDA also has the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each REMS is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. Failure to comply with a REMS may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use or withdrawal of the product from the market. We currently have REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  and Nplate  . Approval of Biosimilars . The ACA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The new law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. In February 2012, the FDA released three draft guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars and these have not yet been finalized. As of the end of 2013, no biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA. The FDA has indicated that it is still evaluating a number of relevant issues, and additional guidance documents are expected to be released, including guidance on the criteria for interchangeability (which the FDA has indicated would be a higher standard than biosimilarity), naming, labeling and clinical pharmacology. In early February 2014, the FDA released its planned agenda for 2014, which included the possible publication of new draft guidance documents relating to biosimilar interchangeability, reference product exclusivity and biosimilars labeling. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If the FDA determines that we no longer comply with applicable regulations and conditions of approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including suspension of our manufacturing operations. Such issues may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation Outside the United States In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the EU, including a centralized procedure. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which conducts a thorough product evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final approval of the marketing authorization and commercialization following country-by-country reimbursement approval. While the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. In the EU, biosimilars have been approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be similar. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. After marketing authorization is obtained, we and various other parties share pharmacovigilance responsibilities regarding the detection, assessment and prevention of adverse effects and other medicine-related problems. Regulatory authorities can demand that safety data or warnings be included on product labels and be provided to healthcare professionals, or recommend the temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of a product from the market. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and for the most part rely on prior marketing approval from a foreign regulatory authority in the United States or EU. The regulatory process in these countries is often less well defined than in the United States and frequently includes manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). On December 19, 2012, Amgen announced that it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgen's promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD with a focus on biologics. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, or other combination or new modalities. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our RD expenses were $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. We conduct clinical trial activities using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue to open clinical sites and to enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation  Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 17, 2014, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at http://www.amgen.com. The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing. The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include the biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/Condition Phase 3 Programs   Aranesp    Myelodysplastic syndromes Blinatumomab  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Brodalumab  Psoriasis Evolocumab (AMG 145)  Dyslipidemia Kyprolis  *  Multiple myeloma Prolia   Male osteoporosis (EU only); Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Rilotumumab  Gastric cancer Romosozumab  Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) Sensipar  / Mimpara    Post renal transplant Talimogene laherparepvec  Melanoma Trebananib  Ovarian cancer Vectibix   Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (US only) Velcalcetide (AMG 416)  Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD receiving dialysis XGEVA   Delay or prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer; Cancer-related bone damage in patients with multiple myeloma Phase 2 Programs   AMG 139  Inflammatory diseases AMG 181  Inflammatory bowel diseases AMG 334  Migraine Blinatumomab  Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) Brodalumab  Inflammatory diseases Kyprolis  *  Small-cell lung cancer Omecamtiv mecarbil  Heart failure Oprozomib*  Hematologic malignancies XGEVA   First-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; Hypercalcemia of malignancy Phase 1 Programs   AMG 110  Various cancer types AMG 157  Asthma AMG 172  Various cancer types AMG 208  Various cancer types AMG 232  Various cancer types AMG 282  Asthma AMG 319  Hematologic malignancies AMG 333  Migraine AMG 337  Various cancer types AMG 357  Autoimmune diseases AMG 557  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 581  Schizophrenia AMG 595  Glioblastoma AMG 729  Autoimmune diseases AMG 780  Various cancer types AMG 811  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 820  Various cancer types AMG 876  Type 2 diabetes AMG 900  Various cancer types Oprozomib*  Solid tumors ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Being developed by Onyx, an Amgen subsidiary ##TABLE_END 13 ##TABLE_START Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.

A phase 2 study for the treatment of asthma is ongoing. Denosumab Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a ligand known as RANKL (that binds to a receptor known as RANK) which is a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. It is being investigated across a range of conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss and numerous tumor types across the spectrum of cancer-related bone diseases, including hypercalcemia of malignancy. Prolia   In August 2013, we submitted a marketing application to the EMA for Prolia  for the treatment of osteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture. A phase 3 study of Prolia  for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is ongoing. XGEVA   In 2013, XGEVA  was approved by the FDA for the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone in the United States. Phase 3 studies for the delay or prevention of bone metastases in patients with adjuvant breast cancer and prevention of SRE in patients with multiple myeloma are ongoing. A phase 2 study for hypercalcemia of malignancy was completed in 2013. A phase 2 study in non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing. We decided not to pursue our marketing application to the EMA for XGEVA  to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of developing bone metastases. Evolocumab Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9). It is being investigated as a treatment for dyslipidemia. In December 2013 and January 2014, we announced results from five phase 3 lipid lowering clinical studies evaluating evolocumab as a monotherapy, in combination with statin therapy, in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in statin-intolerant subjects, and in combination with optimized lipid lowering therapy in a 52 week safety and efficacy study. All five of these studies met their primary endpoints. In a separate phase 3 study of our devices for use in combination with evolocumab, 95 percent or greater of the 164 patients enrolled were able to self-administer at least one full home administration of evolocumab 420 mg subcutaneously by one injection with an automated mini-doser or by three injections with a standard spring-based autoinjector. Reductions in LDL-C were comparable with both devices. Additional phase 3 studies to evaluate evolocumab for cardiovascular outcomes, in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in statin-intolerant subjects, and with intravascular ultrasound are ongoing. Discussions are ongoing regarding timing for filing with various regulatory authorities for evolocumab. In the United States, for example, the timing for filing will depend on our having achieved appropriate progress in our ongoing outcomes study.

Oprozomib Oprozomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor. It is being investigated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma, with phase 1b/2 studies ongoing. Amgen Development of Biosimilars As previously announced, we are collaborating with Actavis, Inc. to develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. The products our collaboration is pursuing include biosimilar versions of bevacizumab (Avastin  ), trastuzumab (Herceptin  ), rituximab (Rituxan  /Mabthera  ) and cetuximab (Erbitux  ). We are also working to develop biosimilar versions of adalimumab (HUMIRA  ) and infliximab (REMICADE  ). Our biosimilar product candidates are in varying stages of regulatory development. We expect that any revenue contribution from these biosimilar programs, if successful, would not occur for a number of years. We have biosimilar product candidates of bevacizumab, adalimumab and trastuzumab, that have pivotal studies ongoing, each of which commenced in 2013. Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we also acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial performance milestone payments; cost sharing; royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.  Kirin-Amgen, Inc. Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A) is a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin). K-A develops and then out-licenses to third parties certain product rights which have been transferred to this joint venture from Amgen and Kirin. K-A has given us exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia; (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. Under these agreements, we pay K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payments from K-A for milestones earned and for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. See Note 7, Related party transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. K-A has also given Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea; (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and in certain other countries and/or regions in Asia; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. K-A also gave Kirin and Amgen co-exclusive licenses to manufacture and market G-CSF, pegfilgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin in China, which Amgen subsequently assigned to Kirin, and as a result, Kirin now exclusively manufactures and markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China. Kirin markets G-CSF, pegfilgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and recombinant human erythropoietin under the brand names GRAN  /Grasin  , Neulasta  , NESP  , ROMIPLATE  and ESPO  , respectively. Under these agreements, Kirin pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Kirin also receives payments from K-A for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. K-A has also given JJ exclusive licenses to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin for all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan. Under this agreement, JJ pays royalties to K-A based on product sales. K-A gave Roche exclusive licenses to market filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in all territories not licensed to Amgen and Kirin. In October 2013, we entered into an agreement to acquire Roches licenses to market filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Pfizer Inc. The co-promotion term of our ENBREL collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada expired on October 31, 2013. We now have full ownership of ENBREL promotional rights in the United States and Canada while the rights to market ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. Under the collaboration agreement, Amgen and Pfizer shared in the agreed-upon selling and marketing expenses approved by a joint committee. We paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits; however, we maintained a majority share of ENBREL profits. Upon expiration of the co-promotion term, we are now required to pay Pfizer residual royalties based on a declining percentage of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada for three years, ranging from 12% to 10%. The amounts of such payments are anticipated to be significantly less than what would be owed based on the terms of the previous ENBREL profit share.  Effective November 1, 2016, there will be no further royalty payments. Glaxo Group Limited We are in a collaboration with Glaxo Group Limited (Glaxo), a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK, for the commercialization of denosumab for osteoporosis indications in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (the Primary Territories). We have retained the rights to commercialize denosumab for all indications in the United States and Canada and for oncology indications in the Primary Territories. Under a related agreement, Glaxo will commercialize denosumab for all indications in countries, excluding Japan, where we did not have a commercial presence at the commencement of the agreement, including China, Brazil, India, Taiwan and South Korea (the Expansion Territories). In the Expansion Territories, Glaxo is responsible for all development and commercialization costs and will purchase denosumab from us to meet demand. We have the option of expanding our role in the commercialization of denosumab in the Primary Territories and certain of the Expansion Territories. In the Primary Territories, we share equally in the commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses, including an amount payable to us in recognition of our discovery and development of denosumab. Glaxo is also responsible for bearing a portion of the cost of certain specified development activities in the Primary Territories. The collaboration agreement with Glaxo for the Primary Territories will expire in 2022 and the related agreement for the Expansion Territories will expire in 2024, unless either agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. As a result of our acquisition of Onyx, we are now party to a collaboration with Bayer to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar  worldwide, except in Japan. The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer. Under the agreements, we are currently funding 50% of mutually agreed RD costs. In the United States we co-promote Nexavar  with Bayer and share equally in the profits or losses of Nexavar  . Outside of the United States, excluding Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside of the United States, except Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. In addition, as part of the acquisition we acquired the right to receive a 20% royalty on Stivarga  global net sales from Bayer. Bayer is responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for the development and commercialization of Stivarga  worldwide. AstraZeneca Plc. We are in a collaboration with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies from Amgen's clinical inflammation portfolio, including brodalumab, AMG 139, AMG 157, AMG 181 and AMG 557. The agreement covers the worldwide development and commercialization of these antibodies, except for certain Asian countries for brodalumab and Japan for AMG 557, which are licensed to other third parties. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 65% of related development costs for the 2012-2014 periods will be funded by AstraZeneca; thereafter, the companies will share costs equally. If approved for sale, Amgen would receive a low-single-digit royalty rate for brodalumab and a mid-single-digit royalty rate for the rest of the portfolio, after which the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration products would be shared equally. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of romosozumab. We have the rights to commercialize romosozumab for all indications in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. UCB has the rights for all EU members at the time of first regulatory approval, Australia and New Zealand. Prior to commercialization, countries that have not been initially designated will be designated to Amgen or UCB in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Generally, development costs are shared equally and we will share equally in the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses. DaVita Inc. We are in a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita that commenced January 1, 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, we will supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVita's and its affiliates' requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party. Human Resources As of December 31, 2013, Amgen had approximately 20,000 staff members. We consider our staff relations to be good.

Any document we file may be inspected, without charge, at the SECs public reference room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or at the SECs internet address at http://www.sec.gov. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. Information related to the operation of the SECs public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 800-SEC-0330 (800-732-0330). ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. For example, we received a warning letter from the FDA dated January 27, 2014, describing issues related to the device constituent parts and certain aspects of the underlying quality systems of our combination products. We are working with the FDA to address the concerns raised in the letter. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. There may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. For example, the EU is in the process of finalizing new requirements related to how clinical trials are conducted. While the aim of the new requirements is improvement in operational efficiency and a streamlining of the overall clinical trial authorization process, the new requirements also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data relating to the products used for such trials. It remains to be seen how the EMA and the individual EU member states will implement the new process and how it will impact companies conducting clinical trials and their ability to protect competitively-sensitive information contained in their approval applications. Failure to comply with new laws or regulations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. For example, questions remain about regulatory authorities views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in endpoints such as PFS but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in OS. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using endpoints other than OS, such as PFS and bone-metastasis-free survival (BMFS). The use of endpoints such as PFS or BMFS, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining an indication. For example, the FDA has indicated that the filing of our BLA for evolocumab is dependent on us having achieved appropriate progress in our ongoing cardiovascular outcomes study. The imposition of additional requirements may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, and delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels. Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in July 2012 our subsidiary Onyx Pharmaceuticals received accelerated approval for Kyprolis  in the United States, with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Kyprolis  as a therapy in treating multiple myeloma. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products' accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product in connection with a renewal assessment, our conditional approval may not be renewed or we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products' labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to communicate to regulatory agencies adverse events reported to us regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the burden on sponsor companies in terms of adverse event management and reporting and safety data analyses. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our independent clinical trial investigators or our licensees) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines and other penalties. Our product candidates and products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies), concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: ##TABLE_START  revised or restrictive labeling for our products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. ##TABLE_END For example, beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs has resulted in changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of six products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. (See Item 1. Business  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates  Amgen Development of Biosimilars.) In many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the U.S. healthcare reform law provided for such a pathway; while the FDA is working to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices which have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such drug delivery devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. Where approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these drug delivery devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain that approval or clearance once it has been received. Failure to supply the devices, delays in or failure of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of Amgen or the third-party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Similarly, some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with an in vitro companion diagnostic device, such as a test kit. In some cases, our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. For example, the FDA has informed us that its approval of Vectibix  for the first- and second-line mCRC indications we are seeking will be contingent upon approval of the companion diagnostic device being developed in collaboration with QIAGEN N.V., which identifies a patient's KRAS gene status. As with drug delivery devices used with our products, our ability to get and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products or product candidates used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices can be substantially dependent on whether the manufacturers of such devices meet their contractual responsibilities to us and/or their obligations to regulatory authorities. Failures by these manufacturers can also result in the significant delays and added costs described above, or even result in the removal of our product from the market. We may not be able to develop commercial products. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant RD investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purposes of safety or efficacy, to gain approval under the biosimilar pathway; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined. ##TABLE_END Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. We may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting similar clinical trials in certain patient populations. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and regulatorily diverse clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations in the RD of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site, not approve the product candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products' relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis, if at all. Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators' clinical trials which could: ##TABLE_START  delay the clinical trial program; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require additional or longer trials to gain approval; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards when such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilars, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2013, the EMA drafted new overarching guidelines revisions and proposals that seek to facilitate biosimilar development by clarifying and streamlining the standards required for the approval of biosimilars. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, countries in the EU, such as France, may adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the United States, with the adoption of the healthcare reform law the FDA was authorized to approve biosimilars under a separate, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. Business  Government Regulation  Regulation in the United States  Approval of Biosimilars.) A growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including a number of our products as well as the biosimilars we are working to develop. Further, biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to obtain U.S. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our products, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Item 1. Business  Competition.) Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products.  In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field with increasing frequency, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer, achieve earlier entry into the market or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. For example, upon the expiry of patent protection for Novartiss Zometa  (zolendronic acid) in 2013, a number of companies have launched generic forms of zolendronic acid, which now compete against XGEVA  . Further, in November, Teva launched short-acting Granix  in the U.S. to compete with NEUPOGEN  and long-acting lipegfilgrastim in Europe to compete with Neulasta  . Further, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  may begin to face competition during the second half of 2014 from the launch of MIRCERA  in the United States. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs. Further, as the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the new Health Insurance Exchanges, CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Additionally, there is an increased focus in the United States on analyzing the impact of various government programs on the federal deficit, which has resulted in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. Private payers also continue to seek to reduce their costs. Additionally, the implementation of ACAs Health Insurance Exchanges, where plans are required to meet certain coverage and cost sharing requirements in the face of increased regulation of rates and profits, could drive consolidation in the insurance industry. The resulting consolidated entities could have greater leverage in making coverage and reimbursement decisions and exert additional pressure on our ability to price and secure patient access for our products. Further, the current Health Care Exchange offerings have very high deductibles and cost-sharing requirements for drugs; if private payers were to broadly adopt these benefit levels for other plans, such change would have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See Item 1. Business  Reimbursement.) Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the U.S. reimbursement of and discounts for our products. Pricing data that we submit impacts the prices providers are paid, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs, and the calculations are complex. Price reporting regulations require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions, and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our pricing calculations are incorrect, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise. ##TABLE_END These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. However, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Nplate  , XGEVA  , Vectibix  and Kyprolis  and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START  capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contamination by microorganisms or viruses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  degree of compliance with regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in forecasts of future demand; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and actual number of production runs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  updating of manufacturing specifications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  production success rates and yields; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and outcome of product quality testing. ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN  and JJ voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT  , manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close cooperation with the FDA. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a single facility, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  , all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN  material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA  at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including: ##TABLE_START  power failures and/or other utility failures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  improper installation or operation of equipment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires. ##TABLE_END In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots EPOGEN  voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire over the next few years., (See Item 1. Business  Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products  Patents.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) We have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets. We expect a significant portion of growth in our future business to come from expanding our footprint and presence in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our current products into new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that the Companys efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed or that the growth rates experienced in these countries will continue in the future. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies that we partner with or acquire in emerging markets (See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.). Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and an evolving legal and regulatory environment. These legal and operational challenges along with the imposition of governmental controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on the international sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. However, we may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. We may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We believe our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the United States including credits allowed for foreign taxes, or a significant change to the Puerto Rico tax system, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Our risk mitigation measures and corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In addition, our business is complex and involves significant operational risks. While we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. Further, we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, OIG, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined obligations. The corporate integrity agreement requires us to make periodic attestations that we are implementing and following the provisions of the corporate integrity agreement, and provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance to the OIG. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our partners, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the corporate integrity agreement. If we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations, laws and/or requirements of the corporate integrity agreement, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks  are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. As more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generics or biosimilars, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Additionally, as a result of global economic conditions, third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. In addition, as a result of the economic conditions and/or employer decisions regarding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the United States in 2015 and 2016, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, any economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures. Credit and economic conditions have adversely impacted the timing of collections of our trade receivables. (See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) Further economic challenges may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. (See  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. In addition, HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business  Business Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected. Cost savings initiatives may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred. Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those efforts, we undertake cost savings initiatives to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these cost savings initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Future dividends, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. The reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price. The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be the world's largest independent biotechnology company, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. Our principal products include Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , XGEVA  , Prolia  and Sensipar  /Mimpara  . For additional information about our products, see Item 1. Business  Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Revenues increased 8% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 10% in the United States and 8% in the rest of the world (ROW). We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2013, and in December 2013, we declared a dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock payable in March 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. In addition to delivering strong operating results, we invested heavily in the business in 2013 and that is reflected in our pipeline advancements. We had positive readouts for evolocumab, talimogene laherparepvec and trebananib and also made progress on our biosimilars as we commenced pivotal trials for three of our six programs. We are now present in more than 75 countries including Japan, China and other emerging markets. This expansion was helped, in part, by our reacquiring rights to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, effective January 1, 2014. Finally, we added Kyprolis  to our marketed products portfolio through the acquisition of Onyx and in-licensed the U.S. commercial rights to ivabradine from Servier. We expect 2014 to be a data-rich year with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA  and Prolia  represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of 10 innovative molecules in our later stage pipeline, including Kyprolis  and evolocumab in both the United States and internationally. (See Item 1. Business  Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.)  Additionally, longer-term growth may be achieved by continued expansion into emerging markets and through strategic business development opportunities. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. Our business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products  including NEUPOGEN  , EPOGEN  , Neulasta  and Aranesp   recently expired or will expire over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition from competitive products including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Item 1. Business  Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products  Patents. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Finally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period.  While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. See Item 1. Business  Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START   Change  Product sales:      U.S. $ 14,045  %  $ 12,815 ROW 4,147  %  3,824 Total product sales 18,192  %  16,639 Other revenues  (23 )%  Total revenues $ 18,676  %  $ 17,265 Operating expenses $ 12,809  %  $ 11,688 Operating income $ 5,867  %  $ 5,577 Net income $ 5,081  %  $ 4,345 Diluted EPS $ 6.64  %  $ 5.52 Diluted shares  (3 )%  ##TABLE_ENDIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2013 reflects growth across the portfolio except for Aranesp  , which declined 4%. The growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth. The increase in ROW product sales for 2013 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp  , which declined 7%, and NEUPOGEN  , which declined 9%. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth. The decrease in other revenues for 2013 was due primarily to revenue recognized in the prior year related to changes in our motesanib collaboration with Takeda and milestone payments received in the prior year from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. The modification to the Takeda arrangement resulted in revenue recognition of $230 million in 2012 and resulted in Takeda receiving an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. The increase in operating expenses for 2013 was driven primarily by RD and Selling, general and administrative (SGA) spending including the addition of Onyx effective October 1, 2013. The increase in net income for 2013 was due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate as well as higher Operating income. The increase in diluted EPS for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in net income and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program in 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. We did not repurchase any shares during the second, third or fourth quarters of 2013. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total Neulasta  and total NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,499  %  $ 3,207  %  $ 3,006 Neulasta   ROW  %   (6 )%  Total Neulasta  4,392  %  4,092  %  3,952 NEUPOGEN   U.S. 1,169  %  1,007  %  NEUPOGEN   ROW  (9 )%   (16 )%  Total NEUPOGEN  1,398  %  1,260   %  1,260 Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 5,790  %  $ 5,352  %  $ 5,212 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a decline in units. The increase in global NEUPOGEN  sales for 2013 was driven by a $155-million order from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW. The increase in U.S. Neulasta  sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW Neulasta  sales for 2012 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe and a decrease in the average net sales price. The increase in U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price. The decrease in ROW NEUPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by a decrease in unit demand from loss of share to biosimilars in Europe. Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN  ) expired in December 2013. We now face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN  and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta  . Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) expires in 2015. Future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START    Change   Change  ENBREL  U.S.  $ 4,256  %  $ 3,967  %  $ 3,458 ENBREL  Canada   %   %  Total ENBREL  $ 4,551  %  $ 4,236  %  $ 3,701 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit demand. ENBREL also faces increased competition. See Item 1. Business  Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products  Competition. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  Aranesp   U.S. $  (4 )%  $  (21 )%  $ Aranesp   ROW 1,164  (7 )%  1,258  (4 )%  1,317 Total Aranesp  $ 1,911  (6 )%  $ 2,040  (11 )%  $ 2,303 ##TABLE_ENDThe decreases in U.S. Aranesp  sales for both 2013 and 2012 were driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe. In 2012, the ROW decline was driven by a decrease in the average net sales price. EPOGEN   Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START   Change   Change  EPOGEN   U.S. $ 1,953  %  $ 1,941  (5 )%  $ 2,040 ##TABLE_ENDEPOGEN  sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth. The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2012 was driven by a 23% decrease in unit demand, driven by reductions in dose utilization due to changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred in 2011. This decrease was offset partially by reductions in customer discounts, as part of new provider contracts that became effective January 1, 2012, and by a year-over-year favorable change in accounting estimates of $96 million. Future EPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as: ##TABLE_START  response to changes in reimbursement including recent reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential increased competition in the U.S. dialysis setting; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. ##TABLE_END See Item 1.

The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 4.0% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Cost of sales increased to 19.2% of product sales for 2012, driven primarily by product mix and the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.4%, 17.2% and 16.3% of product sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party RD arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description Discovery Research and Translational Sciences  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Discovery Research and Translational Sciences $ 1,233  $ 1,137  $ 1,125 Later stage clinical programs 1,950  1,285  Marketed products   1,059 Total RD expense $ 4,083  $ 3,380  $ 3,167 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in RD expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis  ; and an increase of $96 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $58 million. The increase in RD expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million. Selling, general and administrative SGA expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SGA expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery. The increase in SGA expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related and does not have a continuing impact on the combined companys operating results. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation related payments. The compensation payments include cash payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SGA also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. The increase in SGA expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are now required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada of 12% through October 31, 2014, 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016. Other Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which includes severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our cost savings initiatives, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination. Other operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million. See Item 1. Government Regulation  Other Regulation and Note 8, Other charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our legal settlement. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START    Interest expense, net $ 1,022  $ 1,053  $ Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provisions for income taxes $  $  $ Effective tax rate 3.5 %  13.3 %  11.3 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. The increase in interest expense, net in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance. Interest and other income, net The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 was due primarily to lower net gains on sales of investments recognized in the current year. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments. Income taxes The decrease in our effective rate for 2013 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of $182 million ; (ii) the $187 million settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal RD tax credit for 2012 and 2013. Because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the RD tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. The tax benefit of the retroactive extension of the 2012 RD tax credit that was recognized in 2013 was $70 million. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the indefinitely reinvested earnings of our foreign operations. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal RD tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. The effective tax rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 9.2%, 18.7%, and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 19,401  $ 24,061 Restricted investments 3,412   Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments $ 22,813  $ 24,061 Total assets 66,125  54,298 Current portion of long-term debt 2,505  2,495 Long-term debt 29,623  24,034 Stockholders equity 22,096  19,060 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors  There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends). In April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock during the second half of 2011. Subsequently, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, and a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013. In December 2013, the Board of Directors declared a 30% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share of common stock, payable in March 2014. The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, we spent $8.3 billion, $4.6 billion and $832 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, $1.6  billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program; however, we do not expect to make significant repurchases of our common stock during 2014 and 2015. In connection with the acquisition of Onyx in October 2013, we entered into a Repurchase Agreement and a Term Loan Credit Facility. See Note 2, Business combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, we sold 34,097 Class A preferred shares of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, ATL Holdings Limited, on September 30, 2013. We are obligated to repurchase the Class A preferred shares from the counterparties on or before September 28, 2018, for the aggregate sale price of $3.1 billion. Under the Repurchase Agreement, which is accounted for as long-term debt, we are obligated to make payments to the counterparties based on the sale price of the outstanding preferred shares at a floating interest rate of London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus 1.1%. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default, and we have the right to repurchase all or a portion of the Class A preferred shares at any time prior to the required repurchase date. On October 1, 2013, we borrowed $5.0 billion under a Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus additional interest, initially 1%, which can vary based on the credit ratings assigned to our long-term debt by Standard  Poor's Financial Services LLC (SP) and Moody's Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's). A portion of the principal amount of this debt is to be repaid at the end of each quarter equal to 2.5% of the original amount of the loan, or $125 million, with the balance due on October 1, 2018. In February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. In addition, in May 2013, warrants to acquire 32 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $104.80 originally sold in connection with the issuance of the 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes were exercised resulting in a net cash payment of $100 million. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our revolving credit agreement and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2013 , accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $419 million, of which $301 million was past due. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments Of our total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investment balances totaling approximately $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 , approximately $20.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 29.6 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 24.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, SP, Moody's and Fitch, Inc. assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a negative outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility. We issued long-term debt during the three years ended December 31, 2013 , including $8.1 billion, $5.0 billion, and $10.5 billion aggregate principal amounts in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We repaid debt of $3.4 billion, $123 million, and $2.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, respectively. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. In 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $4.4 billion. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2013 , we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014 and is expected to be renewed before its expiration date. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2013 . See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,291  $ 5,882  $ 5,119 Net cash used in investing activities (8,469 )  (9,990 )  (786 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 2,726   (674 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a previously disclosed litigation settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements discussed above and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 693 million, $ 689 million and $ 567 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We currently estimate 2014 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 9.4 billion , $ 2.4 billion and $ 701 million , respectively. Net sales of marketable securities were $ 2.2 billion for 2013 , compared to net purchases of $ 6.9 billion for 2012 and net sales of $ 437 million for 2011 . Financing Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 296 million . These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $ 3.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $ 1.4 billion , and repurchases of our common stock of $ 832 million . Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 1.3 billion , offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $ 4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 , aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments due by period    Year  Years  Years  Years Contractual obligations Total   2 and 3  4 and 5  6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 50,245  $ 3,625  $ 5,007  $ 12,412  $ 29,201 Operating lease obligations     Purchase obligations (5) 2,249     UTBs (6)          Total contractual obligations $ 53,399  $ 4,660  $ 5,696  $ 12,838  $ 30,205 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $68 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. ##TABLE_END 50 ##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Master Repurchase Agreement and Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, in computing interest payments on these debt obligations. See Note 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2013. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2013 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.3 billion, including $875 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of BioVex and Onyx. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of January 1, 2011 $  $  $  $ 1,144 Amounts charged against product sales 1,795  2,626   5,091 Payments (1,592 )  (2,600 )  (717 )  (4,909 ) Balance as of December 31, 2011 1,047    1,326 Amounts charged against product sales 1,480  2,709   4,848 Payments (1,680 )  (2,741 )  (624 )  (5,045 ) Balance as of December 31, 2012    1,129 Amounts charged against product sales 1,784  3,008   5,461 Payments (1,736 )  (2,924 )  (682 )  (5,342 ) Balance as of December 31, 2013 $  $  $  $ 1,248 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , total sales deductions were 23%, 23% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2013 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Including this adjustment, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and less than 5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2013 would have had an impact of approximately $180 million, or approximately 1% of our 2013 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Companys pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Companys operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Companys foreign income associated with the Companys operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors  The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the capital and credit markets, we experienced an increase in interest rates during 2013. As a result, in the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2013 and 2012. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $22.3 billion and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $32.1 billion and a fair value of $33.5 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $26.5 billion and a fair value of $29.9 billion. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was comprised of debt with fixed interest rates, except for $8.1 billion of debt issued in connection with the acquisition of Onyx outstanding at December 31, 2013. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2013, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $4.4 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2013. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $300 million on our interest rate swap contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $320 million and $400 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $750 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $730 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $760 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $700 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on this date, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $660 million and $710 million on this date, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2013, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.0 billion and $516 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.7 billion and $200 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $820 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $400 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2012, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $730 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $350 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $999 million and $629 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2013 and 2012. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2013 and 2012, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $160 million and $60 million, respectively, in the fair value of these contracts on this date, but would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2013 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the \"COSO criteria\"). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 24, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 24, 2014 ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 150% of the performance units granted. ##TABLE_END The number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2013, (i) 4,587,982 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $57.31, (ii) 9,002,887 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 132,647 related dividend equivalents), and (iii)  6,715,224 shares subject to outstanding 2011, 2012 and 2013 performance units (including 111,690 related dividend equivalents). The weighted average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2013 employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 150% of target shares being awarded. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 21,130 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 1,542 related dividend equivalents), which are not included in calculating the weighted average exercise price in column (b). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  This plan has terminated as to future grants.

Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products, where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. Our competitive positions may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is biosimilar to the original reference product. See Government Regulation. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. In the EU, we continue to face competition from biosimilars. In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe, which may seek to obtain U.S. approval. Some of our products compete with each other. For example, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  compete in the United States, primarily in the dialysis setting. Neulasta  competes with NEUPOGEN  , as Neulasta  is administered as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle while NEUPOGEN  requires more frequent dosing. NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  , which we believe is substantially complete. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of the price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. For further discussion, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur products face substantial competition.

On January 7, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim, to be known in the United States as ZARXIO  . The Committee also recommended approval of the biosimilar for use in all indications included in the reference products (NEUPOGEN  ) label. If approved, we anticipate NEUPOGEN  may begin to face competition from the launch of ZARXIO  in the United States. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz. See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. EPOGEN   On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit  , a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN  , under the abbreviated pathway. Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they use through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers. We are required to provide specified rebates or discounts to certain of these government funded programs. For many years, federal and state governments in the United States have pursued methods to reduce the cost of these programs. For example, in 2010 the United States enacted major healthcare reform legislation (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) that had significant impacts which include: a requirement to offer discounts for Medicare Part D drugs in the coverage gap, an increase in the rebates we pay for our products that are covered and reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, a requirement to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization, the expansion of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and a new fee (the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers (BPD fee)). Such changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business. At present, Medicare payment rates are affected by across-the-board federal budget cuts commonly referred to as sequestration. Under sequestration, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% beginning in 2013. In addition, in the effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, our industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. It remains uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction actions that would directly or indirectly affect us and our business. Particular legislative and regulatory developments that would have a significant impact on Amgen include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (including Sensipar  ), changes in the payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs (which could impact many of our principal products, including Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  ) and policies for payment and coverage of biosimilars. Efforts are also being made in the private sector to reduce healthcare costs, notably by healthcare payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue efforts to reduce the cost and/or utilization of healthcare products, including our products. These measures include consolidation of insurers in the United States and the emergence of large integrated (insurer-provider) delivery networks to consolidate purchasing and negotiating power. Generally, in countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic reference pricing, increasing mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. In addition, healthcare reform and related legislative proposals in such countries as France, Germany and Poland, as well as austerity plans in a number of countries, including Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. For example, many Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are proliferating in established and emerging markets. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing The products we manufacture include both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics which are produced in living cells and are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. We perform most of our bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish activities in our Puerto Rico facility and also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers: ##TABLE_START  to manufacture Sensipar  /Mimpara  , except for certain fill and finish activities performed by us in Puerto Rico; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to supplement commercial bulk manufacturing, as needed, for ENBREL, Prolia  , XGEVA  and Vectibix  ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to supplement certain portions of fill and finish for ENBREL; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  to supplement formulation, fill and finish of Nplate  . ##TABLE_END In addition, we utilize single-source third-party contract manufacturers for Kyprolis  . Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California, and West Greenwich, Rhode Island locations. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United Statesprincipally in Kentucky and Californiaand the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government RegulationRegulation of Manufacturing Standards . Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to optimize our manufacturing network and/or mitigate manufacturing risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. These initiatives include the licensure of a new formulation and fill facility at our Puerto Rico site; and as part of a risk mitigation strategy, full licensure of our formulation, fill and finish site in Ireland to manufacture our products. Both of these new facilities will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authorities. In 2014, we completed construction of the planned monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in Singapore. Upon licensure, this facility will expand our capability to manufacture monoclonal antibodies utilizing new technology and innovation. The facility will be fully reconfigurable, providing efficient manufacturing capabilities to help ensure supply of our products worldwide. We also announced plans to build an additional new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Kyprolis  . In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization, to continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and to maintain a state of regulatory compliance. This includes manufacturing network consolidation initiatives as well as process improvements surrounding manufacturing. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development (RD) activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value, and distribution of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are very long - approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable benefit-risk profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a larger number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We cannot market or promote a new product until our marketing application has been approved by the FDA. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our development of commercial products. Approval of Biosimilars .  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the innovators regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovators data in their application to the FDA. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. Since February 2012, the FDA has released six draft guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars and these have not yet been finalized. In early February 2014, the FDA released its planned agenda for 2014, which included the possible publication of new draft guidance documents relating to biosimilar interchangeability and biosimilars labeling. Four manufacturers have announced the filing of five separate marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway. These marketing applications include two for filgrastim, one for pegfilgrastim, and one for epoetin alfa, which if approved would compete with our NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  and EPOGEN  products, respectively. As of the end of 2014, no biosimilar applications had been approved by the FDA. In January 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA ODAC recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim for use in all indications included in the reference products (NEUPOGEN  ) label. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. health care fraud and abuse laws. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. If the FDA determines that we no longer comply with applicable regulations and conditions of approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including suspension of our manufacturing operations. Such issues may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation Outside the United States In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval, including a decentralized and centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. The application is assessed by an initial national agency (Reference Member State) and those of chosen countries (Concerned Member States). Regulatory review is led by the Reference Member State and acknowledged by the Concerned Member States leading to a single approval in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts a thorough product evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final approval of the marketing authorization. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. While the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. In Japan, additional local clinical trials may be required as part of the drug registration process, which can add to the drug registration timelines. In the EU, biosimilars have been approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non-clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be similar. The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that it allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originator products, as benefit-risk has previously been established. Emerging Markets Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU, and in some cases rely on prior marketing approval from United States or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries includes manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia, a number of countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan may require local clinical trials as part of the drug registration process in addition to the global clinical trials which can add to the drug registration timelines. In most Asian markets, registration timelines are dependent on marketing approval in the United States or EU. However, in some emerging markets in Asia, such as China, the regulatory landscape is evolving and the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. Post-approval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events reported following the use of our products through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies, as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Failure to implement these pharmacovigilance activities, including the conduct of post approval commitments for trials in a timely manner, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply with these requirements may also have an adverse effect on our pricing and reimbursement. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS; failure to comply with a REMS may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and can result in additional limitations being placed on a products use or withdrawal of the product from the market. We currently have REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  , Nplate  and BLINCYTO  . Similarly, in the EU, failure to meet risk management commitments may result in substantial financial penalties, reputational loss, or license withdrawal and in serious cases may result in criminal prosecution. Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (for example, violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. On December 19, 2012, Amgen announced that it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgen's promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations. Our RD activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. While we are not required to do so, we strive to conduct our research and manufacturing activities in a manner that meets the intents and purposes of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of oncology, hematology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and general medicine, which includes neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD with a focus on biologics. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, or other combination or new modalities. For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , our RD expenses were $4.3 billion , $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion , respectively. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. We conduct clinical trial activities using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue to open clinical sites and to enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government RegulationClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 12, 2015, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing. The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include the biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/Condition Phase 3 Programs   AMG 416  Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD receiving dialysis Aranesp    Myelodysplastic syndromes BLINCYTO   ALL Brodalumab  Psoriasis; Psoriatic arthritis Evolocumab  Dyslipidemia Kyprolis  *  Multiple myeloma Prolia   Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Romosozumab  Postmenopausal osteoporosis Male osteoporosis Talimogene laherparepvec  Metastatic melanoma Trebananib  First-line ovarian cancer Vectibix   Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (US only) XGEVA   Delay or prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer; Cancer-related bone damage in patients with multiple myeloma Phase 2 Programs   AMG 139  Inflammatory diseases AMG 157  Asthma AMG 181  Inflammatory bowel diseases AMG 334  Migraine AMG 337  Gastric cancer BLINCYTO   Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Brodalumab  Inflammatory diseases Kyprolis  *  Small-cell lung cancer Omecamtiv mecarbil  Heart failure Oprozomib*  Hematologic malignancies XGEVA   Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Phase 1 Programs   AMG 172  Renal cell carcinoma AMG 208  Various cancer types AMG 211  Various cancer types AMG 232  Various cancer types AMG 282  Asthma AMG 319  Hematologic malignancies AMG 357  Autoimmune diseases AMG 557  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 581  Schizophrenia AMG 595  Glioblastoma AMG 780  Various cancer types AMG 811  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 820  Various cancer types AMG 876  Type 2 diabetes AMG 900  Various cancer types Oprozomib*  Solid tumors ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Being developed by Onyx, an Amgen subsidiary. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.

Bayer has no obligation to pay royalties to Amgen for sales of Nexavar  in Japan. Under the agreements, we fund 50% of mutually agreed RD costs. In the United States we co-promote Nexavar  with Bayer and share equally in the profits or losses of Nexavar  . Outside of the United States, excluding Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside of the United States, except Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. AstraZeneca Plc. We are in a collaboration with AstraZeneca to jointly develop and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies from Amgen's clinical inflammation portfolio, including brodalumab, AMG 139, AMG 157, AMG 181, AMG 557 and AMG 570. The agreement covers the worldwide development and commercialization of these antibodies, except for certain Asian countries for brodalumab and Japan for AMG 557 and AMG 570, which are licensed to other third parties. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 65% of related development costs for the 2012-2014 periods were funded by AstraZeneca; now, the companies share costs equally. If approved for sale, Amgen would receive a low-single-digit royalty rate for brodalumab and a mid-single-digit royalty rate for the rest of the portfolio, after which the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration products would be shared equally. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of romosozumab. Under the agreement, we received the rights to commercialize romosozumab for all indications in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. UCB has the rights for all EU members at the time of first regulatory approval, Australia and New Zealand. Prior to commercialization, countries that have not been initially designated will be designated to Amgen or UCB in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusal to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. There may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. For example, the EU recently finalized legislation, which will apply as early as mid-2016, related to the conduct of clinical trials. While the aim of the new legislation is improvement in operational efficiency and a streamlining of the overall clinical trial authorization process, the new requirements also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and submission of quality data relating to the products and product candidates used for such trials.  Starting in 2015, the EMA will make certain clinical trial reports publicly available, which may limit our ability to protect competitively-sensitive information contained in our clinical trial reports. Failure to comply with new laws or regulations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. For example, questions remain about regulatory authorities views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in endpoints such as PFS or Durable Response Rate (DRR) but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using endpoints other than overall survival, such as PFS, DRR, and bone-metastasis-free survival (BMFS). The use of endpoints such as PFS, DRR, or BMFS, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. The imposition of additional requirements may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, and delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels. Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in July 2012 our subsidiary Onyx Pharmaceuticals received accelerated approval for Kyprolis  in the United States, with full approval conditioned on us conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Kyprolis  as a therapy in treating multiple myeloma. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products' accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product in connection with a renewal assessment, our conditional approval may be revoked or not renewed or we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products' labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirement on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:  revised or restrictive labeling for our products; ##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; ##TABLE_END  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. For example, beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed and since that time our ESAs have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs has resulted in changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of nine products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. (See Item 1. BusinessResearch and Development and Selected Product CandidatesAmgen Development of Biosimilars.) In many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA is working to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Additionally, biosimilar products may be subject to patent dispute resolution and/or patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices which have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such drug delivery devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. Where approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these drug delivery devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain that approval or clearance once it has been received. Failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failure of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of Amgen or the third-party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products. Similarly, some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with an in vitro companion diagnostic device, such as a test kit. In some cases, our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. As with drug delivery devices used with our products, our ability to get and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products or product candidates used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices can be substantially dependent on whether the manufacturers of such devices meet their contractual responsibilities to us and/or their obligations to regulatory authorities. Failures by these manufacturers can also result in the significant delays and added costs described above, or even result in the removal of our product from the market. We may not be able to develop commercial products. Amgen invests heavily in RD. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates (including biosimilar product candidates) or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals;  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use;  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purposes of safety or efficacy, to gain approval; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END  the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined. Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. We may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. In addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions which could impair our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products' or product candidates' relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could:  delay the clinical trial program;  require additional or longer trials to gain approval;  prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and ##TABLE_START  render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas. ##TABLE_END Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards when such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current product labels. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products. We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilars, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some European countries, such as France, have considered and may adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the United States, the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars.) A growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including a number of our products as well as the biosimilars we are working to develop. Four manufacturers have announced the filing of five separate marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway. These marketing applications include two for filgrastim, one for pegfilgrastim, and one for epoetin alfa, which if approved would compete with our NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  and EPOGEN  products, respectively. Initial FDA approvals for the first U.S. biosimilars may occur as early as 2015. Further, other biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in Europe may seek to obtain U.S. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products meeting certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our products, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Item 1. BusinessCompetition.) In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. In November 2013, Teva launched short-acting Granix  in the U.S. to compete with NEUPOGEN  and long-acting lipegfilgrastim in Europe to compete with Neulasta  . In addition, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  face competition from the launch of MIRCERA  in the United States. In October 2014, pursuant to a December 2009 settlement agreement between Amgen and Roche, Roche began selling MIRCERA  in the United States under the terms of a limited-license agreement. In addition, our product candidates may face competition from competing products that achieve earlier entry into the market. For example, several of our competitors are working to develop PCSK9 inhibitors at the same time we are developing Repatha  , our own PCSK9 inhibitor. If a competitor gains marketing approval for its PCSK9 inhibitor and launches its product prior to Repatha  receiving marketing approval, the competing product may have an advantage due to its earlier entry into the market. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment and utilization management initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs. Further, as the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the new Health Insurance Marketplaces (or Exchanges), CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Additionally, there is an increased focus in the United States on analyzing the impact of various government programs on the federal deficit, which has resulted in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs and could lead to lower payment rates for our products. Additionally, the implementation of ACAs Exchanges could drive consolidation in the insurance industry. The resulting consolidated entities could have greater leverage in making coverage and reimbursement decisions and exert additional pressure on our ability to price and secure patient access for our products. Further, the current Exchange offerings tend to have very high deductibles and cost-sharing requirements for drugs. Access to our products may be affected by the structure and amount of patient out-of-pocket payments in both plans that operate in Exchanges and also commercial plans. Changes to those out-of-pocket payments, or limitations to payment assistance options, could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Private payers, including healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, also continue to seek to reduce their costs. Healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payers may seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. They could also impose restrictions on access to our products or future products, and could even choose to exclude coverage entirely. Such discounts, rebates, restrictions or exclusions could materially and adversely affect sales of our affected products. Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement.) Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the U.S. reimbursement of and discounts for our products. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs, and the calculations are complex. Price reporting regulations require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions, and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if our pricing calculations are incorrect, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier;  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise. These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. However, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.  Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Nplate  , XGEVA  , Vectibix  and Kyprolis  and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:  capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers;  contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise;  degree of compliance with regulatory requirements;  changes in forecasts of future demand;  timing and actual number of production runs;  updating of manufacturing specifications;  production success rates and yields;  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; and  timing and outcome of product quality testing. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, beginning in September 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of EPOGEN  and JJ voluntarily recalled certain lots of PROCRIT  , manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. The recalls were executed in close cooperation with the FDA. As an additional example, in July 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. We may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. Currently, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland, both of which will require appropriate licensure by regulatory authorities. Additionally, in 2014 we completed construction of the planned monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in Singapore. This Singapore facility will utilize a novel manufacturing technology that has not been previously approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In 2014, we also announced plans to build an additional facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Kyprolis  . These facilities in Singapore will also require licensure by various regulatory authorities. If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for any of these facilities on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda, the Netherlands. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.  We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  , all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN  material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA  at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including:  power failures and/or other utility failures;  breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;  improper installation or operation of equipment;  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak;  inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires. These or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of EPOGEN  voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.  Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years. (See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets. We expect a significant portion of growth in our future business to come from expanding in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our current products into new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that the Companys efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies that we partner with or acquire in emerging markets (See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.). Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and an evolving legal and regulatory environment. These legal and operational challenges along with governmental controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on the international sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our business.  The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN  sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. However, we may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. We may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We believe our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the United States including credits allowed for foreign taxes, or a significant change to the Puerto Rico tax system, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Our risk mitigation measures and corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements. The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In addition, our business is complex, involves significant operational risks and includes the use of third parties to conduct business. While we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. Further, we are operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, OIG, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined obligations. The corporate integrity agreement requires us to make periodic attestations that we are implementing and following the provisions of the corporate integrity agreement, and provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance to the OIG. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our partners, our consultants, our contractors or other third parties are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the corporate integrity agreement. If we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations, laws and/or requirements of the corporate integrity agreement, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks  are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we continue to invest heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.  Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world. As more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generics or biosimilars, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (See We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) For example, in recent years, Amgen has had to pay increased discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program in the United States through expansion to more settings of care and making more entities eligible to the mandatory discounts. Additionally, as a result of global economic conditions, third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. In addition, as a result of the economic conditions and/or employer decisions regarding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the United States in 2015 and 2016, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. In addition to its effects on consumers, any economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the United States, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. Collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures. Credit and economic conditions have adversely impacted the timing of collections of our trade receivables. (See Part IIItem 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.) Further economic challenges may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. (See  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) We also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. Although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. In addition, HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. BusinessBusiness Relationships.) Many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock. Our Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. In addition, in October 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the repurchase program. Whether we pay such dividends and repurchase our stock in the future, and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the Company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. Future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. The reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our Company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan. During the second half of 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules, while improving our cost structure. As part of the plan, we expect to reduce staff and close or dispose of certain facilities. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Following the completion of our restructuring, we must execute our core business initiatives, including advancing our pipeline and addressing competition from competitor products and biosimilars, with fewer human resources. We must also attract, retain and motivate key employees that are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, it may adversely affect our business. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Overview Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal products include Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, XGEVA  , Prolia  , EPOGEN  , Aranesp  and Sensipar  /Mimpara  . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Our strategy for long-term growth continues to focus on discovery and development of innovative medicines to address serious illnesses, development of branded biosimilars, global expansion, next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics, development of improved biologic drug delivery systems and return of capital to shareholders. In 2014, we advanced our strategy. Revenues increased 7% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 5% in the United States and 11% in the rest of the world (ROW). We continued returning capital to shareholders through the payment of dividends and through stock repurchases. We paid dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2013. In December 2014, we declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, payable in March 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2014. In October 2014, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under that program. We reinitiated repurchase activity in November 2014 and repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $153 million during the remainder of 2014. In addition to delivering strong operating results, our innovative pipeline, which includes both internally-developed and externally-acquired opportunities, continued to advance in 2014, with the following milestones achieved: ##TABLE_START Clinical Program  Lead Indication  Milestone Repatha   Dyslipidemia  US submission     EU submission Corlanor   Chronic heart failure  US submission Kyprolis *  Multiple myeloma  Phase 3 ASPIRE data Talimogene laherparepvec  Metastatic melanoma  US submission     EU submission BLINCYTO   Relapsed/refractory ALL  US approval     EU submission Brodalumab **  Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis  Phase 3 data AMG 416  Secondary hyperparathyroidism  Phase 3 data AMG 334  Migraine prophylaxis  Phase 2b data (episodic) ##TABLE_END* Marketed by Onyx, an Amgen subsidiary ** Developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca During 2014, six of our medicines generated positive registration-enabling data and four were submitted for regulatory approval. In December 2014, the FDA approved BLINCYTO  and the Neulasta  Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta  . In 2014, we also advanced and expanded our biosimilar program, including announcing plans to add three more biosimilar molecules to our portfoliofor a total of nine. Finally, in January 2015, we and Onyx announced the submission of a sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Kyprolis  to seek approval for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy. We have near- and long-term growth opportunities ahead, including: (i) the approval and launch of new indications for Kyprolis  in the United States and Europe as well as the approval and launch of several new innovative biologics, including Repatha  and brodalumab, (ii) continuing to move into new geographic growth markets and (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars. We are present in more than 75 countries and, in 2014 we continued to expand into new geographic growth markets, including additional markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. We announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 that reduces our staff and our facilities footprint by the end of 2015. This restructuring plan allows us to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. We are also advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance. These initiatives include improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing RD efficiency. Also during 2014, we completed facilities construction and entered the licensure process for a Next-Generation Biomanufacturing facility in Singapore which we believe, when licensed, will enable us to increase our manufacturing productivity versus conventional alternatives at lower capital costs and operating expense. Our restructuring plan and our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies in all areas of the company will enable us to reallocate resources to fund many of our growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders. Our business will continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition, including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents and see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain non-U.S. countries also. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 are usually lower relative to the preceding fourth quarter. These effects have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change  Product sales:      U.S. $ 14,732  %  $ 14,045 ROW 4,595  %  4,147 Total product sales 19,327  %  18,192 Other revenues  %  Total revenues $ 20,063  %  $ 18,676 Operating expenses $ 13,872  %  $ 12,809 Operating income $ 6,191  %  $ 5,867 Net income $ 5,158  %  $ 5,081 Diluted EPS $ 6.70  %  $ 6.64 Diluted shares  %  ##TABLE_ENDIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2014 reflects growth across the portfolio except for NEUPOGEN  , which declined 28%. This overall growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth, offset partially by a decline in wholesaler and, based on prescription data for ENBREL and Sensipar  , end-user inventory levels. Also, 2014 included a full year of Kyprolis  product sales as a result of the Onyx acquisition on October 1, 2013. The increase in ROW product sales for 2014 reflects growth primarily in our marketed products except ENBREL and Aranesp  , which declined 4% and 2%, respectively. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth, offset partially by declines in average net sales prices. The increase in other revenues for 2014 was due primarily to a full year of Nexavar  collaboration revenues as a result of the Onyx acquisition. The increase in operating expenses for 2014 was driven primarily by cost of sales and restructuring charges, offset partially by the end of the ENBREL profit share on October 31, 2013. The increase in net income for 2014 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by a higher effective income tax rate. The increase in diluted EPS for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net income offset partially by an increase in diluted shares. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2014, 2013 or 2012. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 5,755  (1 )%  $ 5,790  %  $ 5,352 ENBREL 4,688  %  4,551  %  4,236 XGEVA  1,221  %  1,019  %  Prolia  1,030  %   %  EPOGEN  2,031  %  1,953  %  1,941 Aranesp  1,930  %  1,911  (6 )%  2,040 Sensipar  /Mimpara  1,158  %  1,089  %  Other products 1,514  %  1,135  %  Total product sales $ 19,327  %  $ 18,192  %  $ 16,639 Total U.S. $ 14,732  %  $ 14,045  %  $ 12,815 Total ROW 4,595  %  4,147  %  3,824 Total product sales $ 19,327  %  $ 18,192  %  $ 16,639 ##TABLE_ENDFuture sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part 1Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition, Part 1Item 1A. Risk Factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products' significant competitors, see Part 1Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN   Total Neulasta  and total NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,649  %  $ 3,499  %  $ 3,207 Neulasta   ROW  %   %  Total Neulasta  4,596  %  4,392  %  4,092 NEUPOGEN   U.S.  (28 )%  1,169  %  1,007 NEUPOGEN   ROW  %   (9 )%  Total NEUPOGEN  1,159  (17 )%  1,398  %  1,260 Total Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 5,755  (1 )%  $ 5,790  %  $ 5,352 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States. The decrease in global NEUPOGEN  sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government in 2013. Excluding the special order, U.S. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected decreases in unit demand in the United States, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions effective January 1, 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted approval of the Neulasta  Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta  , which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta  on the same day as cytotoxic chemotherapy with delivery of the patients full dose of Neulasta  the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta  prescribing information. The increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a decline in units. The increase in global NEUPOGEN  sales for 2013 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW. Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN  ) expired in December 2013. We face competition in the United States, which could have an impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN  and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta  . Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) expires in 2015. Apotex, Inc. announced that the FDA accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta  , on December 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  , on February 17, 2015. On January 7, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA ODAC recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz. See Part 1, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition and Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  ENBREL  U.S. $ 4,404  %  $ 4,256  %  $ 3,967 ENBREL  Canada  (4 )%   %  Total ENBREL $ 4,688  %  $ 4,551  %  $ 4,236 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in ENBREL sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines. XGEVA  and Prolia   Total XGEVA  and total Prolia  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  XGEVA   U.S. $  %  $  %  $ XGEVA   ROW  %   *  Total XGEVA  1,221  %  1,019  %  Prolia   U.S.  %   %  Prolia   ROW  %   %  Total Prolia  1,030  %   %  Total XGEVA  /Prolia  $ 2,251  %  $ 1,763  %  $ 1,220 ##TABLE_END* Change in excess of 100% The increases in global XGEVA  and Prolia  sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth. EPOGEN   Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  EPOGEN   U.S. $ 2,031  %  $ 1,953  %  $ 1,941 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in EPOGEN  sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unit declines. EPOGEN  sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth. Our remaining material U.S. patent for EPOGEN  expires in May 2015. As a result, we may face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN  sales. In addition, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  will face competition from the launch of MIRCERA  in the United States. Roche began selling MIRCERA  in October 2014 in the United States under terms of a limited patent license obtained from Amgen in connection with the settlement of patent litigation. MIRCERA  competes with Aranesp  in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit  , a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN  , under the abbreviated pathway. In addition, future EPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as response to changes in reimbursement, including the reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014, and changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. See Part 1, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Aranesp   U.S. $  %  $  (4 )%  $ Aranesp   ROW 1,136  (2 )%  1,164  (7 )%  1,258 Total Aranesp  $ 1,930  %  $ 1,911  (6 )%  $ 2,040 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand. The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2014 reflects price declines offset partially by unit demand in international markets. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2013 was driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe. Sensipar  /Mimpara   Total Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Sensipar   U.S. $  %  $  %  $ Sensipar  /Mimpara   ROW  %   %  Total Sensipar  /Mimpara  $ 1,158  %  $ 1,089  %  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth and increases in the average net sales price in the United States; however, the increases in 2014 were offset partially by unfavorable changes in U.S. wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.

As part of the plan, we stated that we would reduce our staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in Washington state and Colorado and reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. Company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint. We estimate that these actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million . During the year ended December 31, 2014, we initiated the above-noted actions and incurred $558 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs will be incurred in 2015. Net savings were not significant in 2014 due to investments in later stage clinical programs, new product launch preparation and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IVNote 2, Restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of sales Cost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million and a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Cost of sales decreased to 17.9% of total revenues for 2013, driven primarily by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset partially by changes in product mix. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 20.1%, 16.0% and 16.5% of total revenues for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in RD with alternative future uses. RD expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party RD arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of RD costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description DRTS  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    DRTS $ 1,212  $ 1,233  $ 1,137 Later stage clinical programs 2,287  1,950  1,285 Marketed products   Total RD expense $ 4,297  $ 4,083  $ 3,380 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in RD expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with Onyx across all categories of RD spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and DRTS activities of $21 million. DRTS expenses included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc. The increase in RD expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis  ; and an increase of $96 million in DRTS activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $58 million. Selling, general and administrative SGA expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the BPD fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SGA expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SGA costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. The decrease in SGA expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. That decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition, an additional $129 million accrual for the BPD fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The royalty percentage was 12% through October 31, 2014, declining to 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016. The increase in SGA expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation-related payments. The compensation payments include cash payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SGA also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated BPD fee. Other Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPRD program acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our other cost savings initiatives, which included severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, comprised primarily of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Interest expense, net $ 1,071  $ 1,022  $ 1,053 Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provision for income taxes $  $  $ Effective tax rate 7.6 %  3.5 %  13.3 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The increase in interest expense, net in 2014 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding offset partially by lower average borrowing rates compared with 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments recognized in 2014. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to a reduction in income from the sale of investments recognized in 2013. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. First, the settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the RD tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 RD tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs in 2014. The decrease in our effective rate for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) we settled our examination with the IRS for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, as discussed above; (ii) costs associated with the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $180 million; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal RD tax credit for 2012 and 2013, as discussed above. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. The effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 would have been approximately 12.8%, 9.2%, and 18.7%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesIncome taxes and Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  December 31,   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 27,026  $ 19,401 Restricted investments   3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments $ 27,026  $ 22,813 Total assets 69,009  66,125 Current portion of long-term debt  2,505 Long-term debt 30,215  29,623 Stockholders equity 25,778  22,096 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividends and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock). The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 31% to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014. In December 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, an increase of 30%, to be paid in March 2015. The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2012, we spent $4.6 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock, and an additional $832 million during the first quarter of 2013, after which repurchases were temporarily suspended. In October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available. We reinitiated repurchasing activity under the program and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, $3.8  billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $223 million and $419 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $124 million and $301 million were past due as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $27.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 , approximately $25.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014 , were $ 0.5 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 29.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, Standard  Poors Financial Services LLC (SP), Moodys Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility. During the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $8.1 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, we repaid debt of $5.6 billion, $3.4 billion, and $123 million, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. In 2014 and 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.25 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2014 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In July 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. This agreement amended and restated our previous revolving credit agreement on substantially similar terms. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2017. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2014 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,555  $ 6,291  $ 5,882 Net cash used in investing activities (5,752 )  (8,469 )  (9,990 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (2,877 )  2,726  ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the ENBREL co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a legal settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 718 million, $ 693 million and $ 689 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 165 million , $ 9.4 billion and $ 2.4 billion , respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, $285 million was used to purchase intangible assets. Net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $ 4.4 billion for 2014 and provided $ 1.7 billion for 2013 . Net purchases of marketable securities totaled $ 6.9 billion for 2012 . Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $ 138 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 186 million . Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $296 million . These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million . Cash used in financing activities during 2012 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion , offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $ 4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 billion . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments due by period as of December 31, 2014    Year  Years  Years  Years Contractual obligations Total   2 and 3  4 and 5  6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 48,262  $ 1,611  $ 8,985  $ 9,579  $ 28,087 Operating lease obligations 1,034     Purchase obligations (5) 3,398  1,377    UTBs (6)          Total contractual obligations $ 52,694  $ 3,123  $ 10,119  $ 10,262  $ 29,190 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $272 million. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt obligation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2014. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) a $225 million payment due to the former shareholders of Proteolix, Inc. in settlement of contingent consideration assumed in the acquisition of Onyx (see Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.0 billion, including $450 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Part IVNote 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of January 1, 2012 $ 1,047  $  $  $ 1,326 Amounts charged against product sales 1,480  2,709   4,848 Payments (1,680 )  (2,741 )  (624 )  (5,045 ) Balance as of December 31, 2012    1,129 Amounts charged against product sales 1,784  3,008   5,461 Payments (1,736 )  (2,924 )  (682 )  (5,342 ) Balance as of December 31, 2013    1,248 Amounts charged against product sales 2,499  3,399   6,586 Payments (2,274 )  (3,454 )  (727 )  (6,455 ) Balance as of December 31, 2014 $ 1,120  $  $  $ 1,379 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , total sales deductions were 25%, 23% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2014 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, and less than 10% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, including the aforementioned adjustment. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2014 would have had an impact of approximately $250 million, or approximately 1% of our 2014 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Companys pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Companys operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Companys foreign income associated with the Companys operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2014 and 2013. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $26.6 billion and $22.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $700 million and $470 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $30.7 billion and a fair value of $33.6 billion. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $32.1 billion and a fair value of $33.5 billion. Our outstanding debt was comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying value of variable rate debt was $5.2 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2014 and 2013, which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $6.65 billion and $4.4 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013 would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $350 million and $300 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $260 million and $320 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $740 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $660 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $750 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $730 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $610 million and $660 million, respectively on these dates, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2014, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.8 billion and $271 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.0 billion and $516 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the net unrealized gain on these contracts was approximately $360 million. As of December 31, 2013, the net unrealized loss on these contracts was not material. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $380 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2013, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $820 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $400 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $875 million and $999 million , respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2014 and 2013. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $80 million and $160 million, respectively, in the fair value of these contracts on this date, but would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by SP, Moody's or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2014 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \"COSO criteria\"). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 19, 2015  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 150% of the performance units granted. ##TABLE_END The number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2014, (i) 2,817,801 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $57.37, (ii) 7,364,475 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 199,755 related dividend equivalents), and (iii)  5,863,491 shares subject to outstanding 2012, 2013 and 2014 performance units (including 198,247 related dividend equivalents). The weighted average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2014 employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 150% of target shares being awarded. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 28,583 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 1,768 related dividend equivalents), which are not included in calculating the weighted average exercise price in column (b). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  This plan has terminated as to future grants.

In addition, in December 2015, we announced that we submitted an MAA to the EMA. ##TABLE_END 3 Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces are based in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into new geographic territories, including parts of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. This expansion can occur either via establishing our own affiliate, acquiring existing third party businesses or product rights, or in partnering with third parties. Use of our own sales and marketing forces versus a third-party varies across these markets. This typically depends on several factors including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of opportunity and the operational capabilities. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors who we utilize as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, as well as through multi-channel marketing. For further discussion, see Government RegulationRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for approximately  97% , 94% and 93% of our U.S. gross product sales, respectively, and approximately 81% , 77% and 75% of our worldwide gross revenues, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers, and we limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit. For financial information related to our one business segment, see Part IVConsolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Note 19, Segment information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are marketed around the world with the United States being our largest market.

Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in research and development (RD) in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. Our competitive positions may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is similar to the original reference product. See Government Regulation. We expect the adverse impact from biosimilars to be more like branded biologics than generic small molecules. We expect patients, providers and payers to place a high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of biosimilars. Zarxio  , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  from Sandoz, a Novartis company (Sandoz), which launched in the United States on September 3, 2015, is the first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market. Companies are developing biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  and Neulasta  , along with additional biosimilar versions of NEUPOGEN  . We expect our products to continue to generate substantial sales and cash flow for years to come even after competitors enter the market. We are prepared to compete and will leverage the experience that we have had in the United States versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in a reduction of the price that we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates (as used in this document, clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies). For further discussion, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future.

In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare. Their efforts have only intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs, and specialty drugs, such as our products, remain a focus for cost containment by these parties. Government and private payers around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of our and other biopharmaceutical products, while demanding a greater level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. Recent developments have intensified scrutiny of biopharmaceutical companies in the United States. Pricing practices of a few biopharmaceutical companies have increased public media and government scrutiny of our entire industry. Such pricing practices provide greater incentive for government and private payers to limit or regulate the price of drug products and services. At the same time, value assessments of new technology, previously used predominantly outside the United States, are having an impact in the U.S. healthcare environment. Healthcare provider and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison to manufacturer pricing. While these organizations do not set drug prices, they seek to influence pricing and payer and provider decision-making by making their assessments public. These developments create greater pressure on the access, pricing and sales of our products. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. We are required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products we sell to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which have increased over time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers (BPD) fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. In addition, Medicare currently requires a 2% reduction to Medicare payment rates to providers due to federal budget cuts referred to as sequestration. Such changes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business. Further efforts to reduce government healthcare program costs could also affect us and our industry. Examples of proposals that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiatives designed to require pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or state legislative efforts to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. Other legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, including for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease; changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for payment; and coverage and payment for biosimilars, including the current Medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policies that enable greater utilization versus the branded originators, or other policies that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantages. In the U.S. private sector, healthcare providers and payers remain focused on reducing healthcare costs. They continue to institute various cost reduction and containment measures such as more limited benefit designs, tiering of co-pays, stricter usage requirements and higher deductible benefit plans that lower healthcare costs altogether or shift a greater proportion of costs to patients. In the retail pharmacy sector, where the majority of our sales for ENBREL, Sensipar  and Repatha  occur, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers are implementing more rigorous utilization and pricing tools that can reduce Amgen product usage or revenues. PBMs are third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for large employers, health plans and government programs. These customers, known as plan sponsors, increasingly rely on PBMs to help administer their plans in a cost effective manner and negotiate contracts on their behalf. Consolidation in the market has resulted in three PBMs overseeing approximately 75% and three insurers overseeing approximately 43%, respectively, of total covered lives in the United States. This has allowed each greater market power and negotiating leverage to influence or impact patient drug usage and price. In the case of PBMs, this can include mandating stricter utilization criteria or excluding drugs from their formulary altogether in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages the patient and provider to seek alternative treatment or pay 100% of the cost of the drug. Generally, in countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries employ a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic reference pricing, increasing mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. In addition, healthcare reform and related legislative proposals have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanisms to reduce government healthcare expenditures. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. For example, many Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are proliferating in established and emerging markets. These dynamics and recent developments serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products, and the industry as a whole. We remain focused on addressing unmet medical needs. We believe the pricing of our medicines reflects the holistic value delivered to patients, providers and payers and is aligned with the investment and risk we undertake to develop medicines as well as fund future scientific innovation. We continue to adapt to these dynamics to successfully bring our medicines to patients. This includes working more closely with payers to address their concerns, delivering robust supporting data packages, and developing mutually beneficial contracting structures. As such, we believe we can successfully deliver the value of our medicines. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk FactorsGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing The products we manufacture include both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics which are produced in living cells and are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. We perform most of our bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish activities in our Puerto Rico facility and also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the bulk, formulation, fill, and/or packaging of certain Amgen principal products, including ENBREL, Neulasta  , XGEVA  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , Prolia  , as well as Kyprolis  . Clinical bulk, formulation, fill and finish manufacturing facilities are operated primarily in our Thousand Oaks, California, and West Greenwich, Rhode Island locations. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in the United Statesprincipally in Kentucky and Californiaand the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government RegulationRegulation of Manufacturing Standards . Manufacturing Initiatives We believe we are a leader in manufacturing biologics and our manufacturing capabilities are a competitive advantage. We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend this advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or mitigating manufacturing risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. These initiatives include the licensure of a new formulation and fill facility at our Puerto Rico site; and as part of a risk mitigation strategy, full licensure of our formulation, fill and finish site in Ireland to manufacture our products. Both of these new facilities will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authorities. In 2015, we initiated the drug substance conformance campaign to facilitate licensure at our monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in Singapore. Upon licensure, this facility will expand our capability to manufacture monoclonal antibodies utilizing new technology and innovation. The facility will be fully reconfigurable, providing efficient manufacturing capabilities to help ensure supply of our products worldwide. We have also begun construction on an additional new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Kyprolis  . In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization, to continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and to maintain a state of regulatory compliance. This includes manufacturing network consolidation initiatives as well as process improvements surrounding manufacturing. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to assist in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. These procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products including global regulatory implications. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value, and distribution of our products. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long - approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products or an NDA for small molecule products. We cannot market or promote a new product until our marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Approval of Biosimilars .  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non-clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be similar. The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, as risk-benefit has previously been established. In order to preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products, which prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. The FDA has released seven guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars and four of these have been finalized. The FDA has announced its planned publication of additional draft guidance documents relating to biosimilar interchangeability and biosimilars labeling. As of the end of 2015, one biosimilar application has been approved by the FDA, and a number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway, some of which are for biosimilars of our products. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. health care fraud and abuse laws. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation Outside the United States In the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval, a decentralized and centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. The application is assessed by an initial national agency (Reference Member State) and the subsequent countries that the applicant chooses to seek approval (Concerned Member States). Regulatory review is led by the Reference Member State and acknowledged by the Concerned Member States leading to a single approval in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts a thorough product evaluation, drawing from its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final approval of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP  s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. In Japan, additional local clinical trials may be required as part of the drug registration process, which can add to the drug registration timelines. In the EU, biosimilars have been approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, sponsors of a biosimilar may seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non-clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be similar. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU, and in some cases rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia, a number of countries such as China, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trials as part of the drug registration process in addition to the global clinical trials which can add to the drug registration timelines. In most Asian markets, registration timelines are dependent on marketing approval in the United States or EU. However, in some emerging markets in Asia, such as China, the regulatory landscape is evolving and the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. Post-approval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events reported following the use of our products through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies, as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and we currently have REMS for our ESAs, Prolia  , Nplate  and BLINCYTO  . Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (for example, violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. On December 19, 2012, Amgen announced that it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgens promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness in the areas of oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD with a focus on biologics. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, or other combination or new modalities. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , our RD expenses were $4.1 billion , $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion , respectively. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States (including Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts), Iceland and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. We conduct clinical trial activities using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue to open clinical sites and to enroll patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government RegulationClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 15, 2016, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing. The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include the biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/Condition Phase 3 Programs   AMG 334  Episodic migraine Aranesp    Myelodysplastic syndromes BLINCYTO   ALL ENBREL  Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis remission IMLYGIC   Metastatic melanoma Kyprolis   Multiple myeloma Parsabiv   SHPT in patients with CKD receiving dialysis Prolia   Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Repatha   Hyperlipidemia Romosozumab  Postmenopausal osteoporosis; Male osteoporosis Vectibix   mCRC XGEVA   Delay or prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer; Cancer-related bone damage in patients with multiple myeloma Phase 2 Programs   AMG 157  Asthma; Atopic dermatitis AMG 181  Inflammatory bowel diseases AMG 334  Chronic migraine AMG 520  Alzheimers disease AMG 899  Dyslipidemia BLINCYTO   Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Omecamtiv mecarbil  Heart failure XGEVA   Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Phase 1 Programs   AMG 211  Various cancer types AMG 224  Multiple myeloma AMG 228  Solid tumors AMG 232  Various cancer types AMG 301  Migraine AMG 319  Hematologic malignancies AMG 330  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 357  Autoimmune diseases AMG 557  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 581  Schizophrenia AMG 592  Inflammatory diseases AMG 820  Various cancer types Kyprolis   Small-cell lung cancer Oprozomib  Hematologic malignancies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study; typically performed with registrational intent.

Amgen Development of Biosimilars We continue to collaborate with Allergan to develop and commercialize, on a worldwide basis, four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. The products our collaboration is pursuing include biosimilar versions of bevacizumab (Avastin  ), trastuzumab (Herceptin  ), rituximab (Rituxan  / Mabthera  ) and cetuximab (Erbitux  ). We are also working to develop biosimilar versions of adalimumab (HUMIRA  ) and infliximab (REMICADE  ), in addition to three other biosimilar molecules. Our biosimilar product candidates are in varying stages of clinical development as described in the following table: ##TABLE_START Biosimilar  Status adalimumab (HUMIRA  )  BLA accepted by FDA for review MAA submitted to EMA bevacizumab (Avastin  )  Phase 3 NSCLC study met primary and key secondary endpoints trastuzumab (Herceptin  )  Phase 3 breast cancer study ongoing infliximab (REMICADE  )  Phase 1 completed ##TABLE_ENDBusiness Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we also acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial performance milestone payments; cost sharing; royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.  Kirin-Amgen, Inc. Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A) is a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin). K-A develops and then out-licenses to third parties certain product rights which have been transferred to this joint venture from Amgen and Kirin. K-A has given us exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, all Central American, South American, Middle Eastern and African countries and certain countries in Asia; (ii) darbepoetin alfa and romiplostim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. Under these agreements, we pay K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, we also receive payments from K-A for milestones earned and for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. See Part IVNote 8, Related party transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. K-A has also given Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea; (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and in certain other countries and/or regions in Asia; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. K-A also gave Kirin and Amgen co-exclusive licenses to manufacture and market G-CSF, pegfilgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin in China, which Amgen subsequently assigned to Kirin, and as a result, Kirin now exclusively manufactures and markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China. Kirin markets G-CSF, pegfilgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and recombinant human erythropoietin under the brand names GRAN  /Grasin  , Peglasta  /Neulasta  /G-Lasta  , NESP  /Aranesp  , ROMIPLATE  and ESPO  , respectively. Under these agreements, Kirin pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Kirin also receives payments from K-A for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. K-A has also given JJ exclusive licenses to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin for all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan. Under this agreement, JJ pays royalties to K-A based on product sales. Pfizer Inc. The co-promotion term of our ENBREL collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada expired on October 31, 2013, giving us full ownership of ENBREL promotional rights in the United States and Canada while the rights to market ENBREL outside the United States and Canada are reserved to Pfizer. Under the collaboration agreement, Amgen and Pfizer shared in the agreed-upon selling and marketing expenses approved by a joint committee. We paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits; however, we maintained a majority share of ENBREL profits. In 2016, we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties of 10% of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The amounts of such payments are significantly less than what was owed based on the terms of the previous ENBREL profit share.  Effective November 1, 2016, there will be no further royalty payments. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. As a result of our acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Onyx), we are party to a collaboration with Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Bayer) to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar  (sorafenib) worldwide, except in Japan. The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer. In May 2015, we and Bayer amended the terms of the collaboration, which terminated the co-promotion agreement in the United States, and transferred all U.S. operational responsibilities to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the termination of the co-promotion agreement, we co-promoted Nexavar  with Bayer and shared equally in the profits in the United States. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on U.S. sales of Nexavar  at a percentage rate in the high 30s. Outside of the United States, excluding Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures and mutually agreed RD expenses, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside of the United States, except Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of romosozumab. Under the agreement, we received the rights to commercialize romosozumab for all indications in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. UCB has the rights for all EU members at the time of first regulatory approval, Australia and New Zealand. Prior to commercialization, countries that have not been initially designated will be designated to Amgen or UCB in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Generally, development costs are shared equally and we will share equally in the worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses. DaVita Inc. We are in a seven-year supply agreement with DaVita that commenced January 1, 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, we will supply EPOGEN  in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party. Human Resources As of December 31, 2015 , Amgen had approximately 17,900 staff members. We consider our staff relations to be good.

Information related to the operation of the SECs public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 800-SEC-0330. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and more control over pricing could hurt our ability to price our products based upon their value. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from the U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. (See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement.) Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions such as the ACA or as a result of regulations implemented by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Legislative or regulatory changes that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer patient co-pay payment assistance or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Private payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs and others, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers. Insurers and others are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of patient co-pay payment assistance programs. Private payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may even choose to exclude coverage entirely. Such discounts, rebates, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a monthly and quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. Outside the United States, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement.) For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Item 1. BusinessCompetition.) We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that they may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profiles, are easier to administer, reach the market before our products or that are otherwise competitive with our products. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future. We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar competition in the future. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued in 2005. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries have adopted biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products, and other countries may adopt similar measures. Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. In the United States, in 2010 the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars.) The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Zarxio  , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  from Sandoz, was launched in the United States in 2015. In addition, a growing number of companies have announced that they are in varying stages of development of biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including biosimilars that would compete with our products. Some companies pursuing development of biosimilars versions of our products may challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. (See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.) For example, in June 2013, Sandoz filed suit against us, seeking a declaratory judgment that the etanercept product it was developing as a biosimilar to ENBREL did not infringe certain of our patents, and that those patents were also invalid and unenforceable. While that suit was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as Sandoz had not yet filed a marketing application with the FDA, Sandoz subsequently announced that its marketing application has now been accepted for review by the FDA. (For information related to our other biosimilars patent litigation, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products meeting certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our products, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the United States as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. Once approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusal to approve pending applications, delay in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets.  Failure to comply with new laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening (progression-free survival, or PFS). Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in OS, the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attacks and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDL-C levels. However, the FDA ultimately approved Repatha  only for a subset of those patients, citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events. While our ongoing phase 3 study is evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events, that study may fail to meet its clinical efficacy endpoints or may identify safety issues with the product. (See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Even if the ongoing outcomes study meets its clinical endpoints, regulators may not approve Repatha  for use beyond the currently approved label indications. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels. Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in December 2014, we received accelerated approval for BLINCYTO  for the treatment of patients with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in the United States, with continued approval contingent upon clinical benefit in subsequent trials. BLINCYTO  also received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL from the EC in November 2015. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, our conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirement on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products.  Similarly, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationPost-Approval Phase) we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks, and vary in the elements they contain. For example, our ESA REMS requires applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS, and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of certain portions of our REMS. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: ##TABLE_START  revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; ##TABLE_END  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. For example, since 2006, when adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed, ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs has resulted in, and may continue to result in, changes to ESA labeling, our ESA REMS and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of nine products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future.) Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD. Amgen invests heavily in RD. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates (including biosimilar product candidates) or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals;  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use;  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purposes of safety or efficacy, to gain approval; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined. A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in May 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program, which we believe likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions which could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate the clinical trial program and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices which have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. In addition, Vectibix  is used in combination with a test kit (which is a companion diagnostic device), and some of our product candidates may also be used in combination with a companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. Where approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failure of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of Amgen or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the addition of new indications for existing products. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. For example, a Texas hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) has sought to challenge dozens of patents held by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including one of the patents we hold for ENBREL. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and are currently and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, including the requirement to provide 180 days notice in advance of commercial marketing. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products. While we may attempt to challenge such patents, our efforts may be unsuccessful. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired. (See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents.) As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our affected product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians groups, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies, and a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical products. These assessments may come from private organizations, such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, who publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers. In addition, government HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. A change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the United States including credits allowed for foreign taxes, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, such as Puerto Rico, or changes in tax law in the United States or other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Insulet Corporation is our single source of the on-body injector for our Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and ##TABLE_END  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies, natural disasters, or otherwise. These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product use and sales and our business and results of operations. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and are using contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. (See Item 1. BusinessManufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing.) Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:  capacity of manufacturing facilities;  contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies, natural disasters, or otherwise;  compliance with regulatory requirements;  changes in forecasts of future demand;  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;  updates of manufacturing specifications;  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;  timing and outcome of product quality testing;  power failures and/or other utility failures; and/or  breakdown, failure or substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. In 2015, we initiated the drug substance conformance campaign to facilitate licensure at our monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in Singapore. This Singapore facility will utilize a novel manufacturing technology that has not been previously approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We have also begun construction on an additional new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Kyprolis  . These facilities in Singapore will require licensure by various regulatory authorities. If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for either of these facilities on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could have a material adverse effect our product sales, business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, the Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Prolia  and XGEVA  and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for Neulasta  and ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and Aranesp  , all of the purification of bulk EPOGEN  material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia  and XGEVA  at this facility. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. (See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In June 2015, Puerto Ricos Governor stated that the Puerto Rico government, which includes certain government entities, is unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, and since that time, Puerto Rico failed to make certain debt payments. In September 2015, the Puerto Rico government released a Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan (FEGP), a proposal for economic growth and reform measures that also included recommendations for debt restructuring. Due to a deteriorating liquidity position, the Governor issued an executive order in December 2015, providing for certain extraordinary liquidity measures such as deferral of tax refunds, stretching of payments to suppliers and the implementation of a clawback of revenues assigned to certain government entities in order to make payments on general obligation bonds and provide essential government services. On January 18, 2016, the Puerto Rico government revised the FEGP to reflect larger government financing gaps in the near and long term as well as the governments deteriorating liquidity position. The Puerto Rico government is currently in negotiations with creditors to restructure the governments debt, and litigation has commenced with certain bond insurers over failure to make certain debt payments. If the Puerto Rico government is not able to restructure the debt obligations or get forbearance on debt payments, it could impact the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our business. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America (Fresenius), own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN  sales. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase less or none of our products in favor of competitive products can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process, and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products into new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies that we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. (See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.) Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or an evolving legal and regulatory environment. These legal and operational challenges along with governmental controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales, business and results of operations. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. In connection with that settlement, we are now operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until December 2017. The CIA also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance program. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the CIA, the failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. We may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. We may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the Company, its patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. As a global biotechnology company, our systems are subject to frequent cyber-attacks. These attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors including nation states, organized crime groups and hacktivists. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. Although in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we continue to invest heavily in the protection of our critical or sensitive data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or detect service interruptions or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.) As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially impacted. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_ENDThe following managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgens business. MDA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MDA are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. Forward-looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, and continue, as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

Overview Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve peoples lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the worlds leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal products include ENBREL, Neulasta  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , XGEVA  , Prolia  and NEUPOGEN  . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. In 2015, we advanced our strategy, by delivering strong financial performance across the business, advancing our innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, developing improved biologic drug delivery systems, transforming our business to a more focused operating model and returning capital to shareholders. ##TABLE_START  Financial performance was strong, as total revenues and product sales increased 8% driven by strong performance across the portfolio except EPOGEN  and NEUPOGEN  which both decreased by 9%. Net income and diluted EPS increased by 35%, driven by higher total revenue and lower operating expenses. Cash flows from operating activities grew 6% to $9.1 billion, driven by higher operating income, enabling us to grow the business and invest for the future. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our progress can also be seen in six innovative new launches - four in oncology and two in cardiovascular disease. For example, we continued to expand indications for our products, including for Kyprolis  , which is now the only approved therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet or triplet combination, that is offered in a variety of doses to meet individual patient needs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our pipeline continues to advance with the recent regulatory submissions for Parsabiv  , positive phase 3 data for romosozumab (in collaboration with UCB), phase 2 data for AMG 334 (in collaboration with Novartis) and phase 2b data for omecamtiv mecarbil (in collaboration with Cytokinetics). In 2015, we also continued to advance our biosimilar program, including the filing for global regulatory approval for ABP 501, biosimilar adalimumab (HUMIRA  ) and phase 3 data for ABP 215, biosimilar bevacizumab (Avastin  ). ##TABLE_END 39 ##TABLE_START  We continue to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate our products. The Neulasta  Onpro  kit was approved by the FDA at the end of 2014 and now represents approximately one fourth of our U.S. Neulasta  business. We also submitted applications to regulators, including the FDA and EMA, for a single-dosing option for the monthly administration of Repatha  . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In 2015, we continued to execute the transformation and process improvement efforts announced in 2014. As part of these efforts, we committed to a more focused operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company have enabled us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Finally, we continued returning capital to shareholders in 2015 through the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We paid dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2014. In December 2015, we declared a dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2016, payable in March 2016, representing a 27% increase over the quarterly dividends paid in 2015. We also repurchased 12 million shares of our common stock throughout 2015 at an aggregate cost of $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2015, $4.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. ##TABLE_END We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy focusing on the areas of oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. We have near- and long-term opportunities ahead, including: (i) successfully executing on new product launches, (ii) advancing our robust pipeline with new innovative biologics and new delivery systems, (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars and (iv) advancing the next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics. We expect our legacy products to continue to generate significant cash flows. In addition, we continue to focus on collaborating with innovators and value-creating business development activities to expand our approach to deliver significant impact for patients and advance programs where there remains high unmet medical need. Finally, we continue to expand into new geographic growth markets, enabling us to be present in over 100 countries. Our business will continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches, including from biosimilars. 2016 is the first full year we are competing without patent protection on several of our principal products in the United States. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents and see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of global economic conditions, as well as public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change  Product sales:      U.S. $ 16,523  %  $ 14,732 Rest of world (ROW) 4,421  (4 )%  4,595 Total product sales 20,944  %  19,327 Other revenues  (2 )%  Total revenues $ 21,662  %  $ 20,063 Operating expenses $ 13,192  (5 )%  $ 13,872 Operating income $ 8,470  %  $ 6,191 Net income $ 6,939  %  $ 5,158 Diluted EPS $ 9.06  %  $ 6.70 Diluted shares  (1 )%  ##TABLE_ENDIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. U.S. product sales for 2015 increased across the portfolio except for EPOGEN  and NEUPOGEN  , which declined 9% and 5%, respectively. The U.S. increase was driven primarily by increases in net selling prices. The decrease in ROW product sales for 2015 reflects unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices, offset partially by unit demand growth. The decrease in operating expenses for 2015 was driven primarily by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts, higher restructuring charges in the prior year and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by increased support for launch products. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

The increase in ENBREL sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. Neulasta   Total Neulasta  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,891  %  $ 3,649  %  $ 3,499 Neulasta   ROW  (13 )%   %  Total Neulasta  $ 4,715  % $ 4,596  %  $ 4,392 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of the end of December 2015, the Neulasta  Onpro  kit represents approximately one fourth of our U.S. Neulasta  business. In December 2014, the FDA granted approval of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta  on the same day as chemotherapywith delivery of the patients full dose of Neulasta  the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta  prescribing information. The increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States. Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) expired in October 2015. On December 17, 2014, Apotex, Inc. (Apotex) announced that the FDA accepted for filing its application, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta  . Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on Neulasta  sales .

Future Neulasta  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.

The increase in U.S. Aranesp  sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in net selling price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand growth. The decrease in ROW Aranesp  sales for 2014 reflects a decrease in net selling price offset partially by unit demand growth in international markets. Supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries relating to our European patent for darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp  ) expire in June 2016. See Part 1, Item 1.

The decline in EPOGEN  sales accelerated in the second half of 2015 to 37% in the fourth quarter 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter in 2014. The increase in EPOGEN  sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in net selling price offset partially by a decline in unit demand. Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN  expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on EPOGEN  sales. Currently, in the United States, EPOGEN  and Aranesp  compete with MIRCERA  , which Roche began selling in October 2014 and, as of May 2015, licensed commercialization rights in the United States to Galenica. Simultaneously, Galenica entered into an agreement to supply MIRCERA  to Fresenius, which provides treatment to a significant portion of U.S. dialysis patients. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc.

The decrease in global NEUPOGEN  sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government in 2013. Excluding the special order, U.S. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected declines in unit demand in the United States, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain international areas effective January 1, 2014. There is competition in the United States, which we expect will have a material adverse impact on future sales of NEUPOGEN  . On September 3, 2015, Sandoz announced that they launched Zarxio  , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  , in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Apotex announced that the FDA accepted for filing its application, under the abbreviated pathway, for its biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  .

This plan includes a restructuring, which is delivering cost savings and funding investments. The restructuring includes reducing our geographic footprint, as well as reducing our staff by 3,500 to 4,000, both of which allow us to reinvest and hire in our strategic areas of focus. We estimate that this restructuring plan will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million , which is less than originally expected due to better than anticipated results from the exit of two of our closed facilities. Restructuring costs to date of $672 million were incurred as of December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring costs of $114 million and $558 million , respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2016 and 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Net savings were not significant in 2015 and 2014 due to the investments in new product launch preparations, later stage clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IVNote 2, Restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 19.5% of total revenues for 2015, driven primarily by lower royalties, higher net selling prices, manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs related to our restructuring plan. The year ended December 31, 2014, also had a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Cost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million as well as the aforementioned $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 17.8%, 20.1% and 16.0% of total revenues for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Research and development The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description DRTS  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    DRTS $  $ 1,212  $ 1,233 Later stage clinical programs 1,876  2,287  1,950 Marketed products 1,197   Total RD expense $ 4,070  $ 4,297  $ 4,083 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in RD expense for 2015 was driven by decreased costs associated with later stage clinical programs support of $411 million and DRTS of $215 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed products support of $399 million. All categories of RD spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan, which were offset partially by increased launch related spend in marketed products, primarily Repatha  . Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were largely categorized as later stage clinical programs. The 2015 DRTS expenses also included up-front milestone payments related to our collaborations with Xencor, Inc. and Novartis. The increase in RD expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with Onyx across all categories of RD spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and DRTS activities of $21 million. The 2014 DRTS expenses also included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc. Selling, general and administrative The increase in Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense for 2015 was driven primarily by new product launches offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. 2014 also included an additional $129 million accrual for the BPD fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year. The decrease in SGA expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. That decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition, the aforementioned additional accrual for the BPD fee and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The royalty percentage was 12% through October 31, 2014, declining to 11% through October 31, 2015, and 10% through October 31, 2016. Effective November 1, 2016, there will be no further royalty payments. Other Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings, certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, primarily separation costs of $49 million, $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior year business combination, and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures. Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPRD program acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Interest expense, net $ 1,095  $ 1,071  $ 1,022 Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provision for income taxes $ 1,039  $  $ Effective tax rate 13.0 %  7.6 %  3.5 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The increase in interest expense, net in 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to a higher average amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, offset partially by the impacts of repayment of variable rate debt. The increase in interest expense, net in 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding, offset partially by lower average borrowing rates. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances with a modestly higher portfolio yield, offset partially by net losses on sales of interest bearing securities in 2015. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments in 2014. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs in 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 is due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. First, the settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Companys 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the RD tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Companys 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Companys 2013 financial results. Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 RD tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 would have been approximately 16.4%, 12.8% and 9.2%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesIncome taxes and Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  December 31,   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 31,382  $ 27,026 Total assets $ 71,576  $ 69,009 Current portion of long-term debt $ 2,250  $ Long-term debt $ 29,306  $ 30,215 Stockholders equity $ 28,083  $ 25,778 ##TABLE_ENDWe intend to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 27%, to be paid in March 2016. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2013, we spent $832 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of common stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. During 2015, we repurchased $1.9 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2015, $4.9 billion remained available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $222 million and $223 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $127 million and $124 million were past due as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $31.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 , approximately $29.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015 , were $ 2.3 billion and $ 29.3 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014 , were $ 0.5 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, Standard  Poors Financial Services LLC (SP), Moodys Investor Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $3.5 billion, $4.5 billion, and $8.1 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, we repaid debt of $2.4 billion, $5.6 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.65 billion. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In July 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2017. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2015 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,077  $ 8,555  $ 6,291 Net cash used in investing activities (5,547 )  (5,752 )  (8,469 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (3,117 )  (2,877 )  2,726 ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015 due primarily to improvement in our operating margin and the effective termination of foreign currency contracts that resulted in the receipt of $340 million in cash, offset by the timing of payment to vendors and cash received from customers. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the ENBREL co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 594 million, $ 718 million and $ 693 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. We currently estimate 2016 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 359 million , $ 165 million and $ 9.4 billion , respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, $55 million and $285 million , respectively, was used to purchase intangible assets. Net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $ 4.4 billion in 2015 and 2014 , and provided $ 1.7 billion in 2013 . Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $2.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $ 1.9 billion and the settlement of obligations incurred in connection with the acquisitions of businesses of $253 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Companys equity award programs of $186 million . Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Companys equity award programs of $296 million . These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments due by period as of December 31, 2015    Year  Years  Years  Years Contractual obligations Total   2 and 3  4 and 5  6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 49,786  $ 3,440  $ 8,604  $ 7,364  $ 30,378 Operating lease obligations     Purchase obligations (5) 2,817  1,045    UTBs (6)          Total contractual obligations $ 53,352  $ 4,612  $ 9,573  $ 7,954  $ 31,213 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2015 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $83 million. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2015 , in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt obligation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2015 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Dezima Pharma B.V. (Dezima) and BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $5.0 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of Dezima and BioVex. See Part IVNote 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of January 1, 2013 $  $  $  $ 1,129 Amounts charged against product sales 1,784  3,008   5,461 Payments (1,736 )  (2,924 )  (682 )  (5,342 ) Balance as of December 31, 2013    1,248 Amounts charged against product sales 2,499  3,399   6,586 Payments (2,274 )  (3,454 )  (727 )  (6,455 ) Balance as of December 31, 2014 1,120    1,379 Amounts charged against product sales 2,734  4,275   7,741 Payments (2,735 )  (4,198 )  (701 )  (7,634 ) Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 1,119  $  $  $ 1,486 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , total sales deductions were 27%, 25% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 3% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 3% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and less than 10% for the year ended December 31, 2013, including the aforementioned adjustment. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2015 would have had an impact of approximately $270 million, or approximately 1% of our 2015 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Companys tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Companys pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Companys operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Companys foreign income associated with the Companys operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. (Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , was comprised of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $31.0 billion and $26.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $840 million and $700 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , would not result in a material effect on income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $31.6 billion and a fair value of $33.1 billion. As of December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $30.7 billion and a fair value of $33.6 billion. Our outstanding debt was comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying value of variable rate debt was $2.8 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2015 and 2014 , which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $290 million and $350 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $210 million and $260 million, respectively, but would have no material effect on cash flows or income in the respective ensuing year. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014 , the carrying value and fair value of this debt denominated in foreign currencies was $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $660 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $610 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $740 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $660 million, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year. The analysis for this debt does not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the related cross-currency swap contracts which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. With regard to our $2.7 billion notional amount of cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros and pound sterling, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $610 million on each of these dates, but would have no material effect on the related cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2015 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.3 billion and $225 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2014 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.8 billion and $271 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of these contracts was approximately $140 million and $360 million, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $320 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2014 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2014 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $700 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately $380 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $911 million and $875 million , respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts, related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by SP, Moodys or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2015 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \"COSO criteria\"). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 16, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 16, 2016  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 150% of the performance units granted. ##TABLE_END The number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2015, (i) 2,188,567 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $57.72, (ii) 5,237,393 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 213,554 related dividend equivalents), and (iii)  3,887,680 shares subject to outstanding 2013, 2014 and 2015 performance units (including 145,581 related dividend equivalents). The weighted average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2015, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 150% of target shares being awarded. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 26,619 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 3,256 related dividend equivalents), which are not included in calculating the weighted average exercise price in column (b). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  This plan has terminated as to future grants.

The results ruled out inferiority compared to trastuzumab but could not rule out superiority based on its primary efficacy endpoint of the difference of the percentage of patients with a pathologic complete response. ##TABLE_END * FDA provisionally approved trade name Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. This expansion is occurring by either establishing our own affiliate, acquiring existing third- party businesses or product rights or in partnering with third parties. Use of our own sales and marketing forces versus a third-partys varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of opportunity and the operational capabilities. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors that we utilize as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising, as well as through multi-channel marketing. For further discussion, see Government RegulationRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for approximately 96%, 97% and 94% of our U.S. gross product sales, respectively, and approximately 81%, 81% and 77% of our worldwide gross revenues, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit. For financial information related to our one business segment, see Part IVConsolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, and Note 19, Segment information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are marketed around the world with the United States being our largest market.

It is not indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. XGEVA  was launched in Europe in 2011, and is used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors. EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa) We market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. EPOGEN  was launched in 1989, and we market it for the indication to treat anemia caused by CKD in patients on dialysis to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. The majority of our sales are to two large dialysis providers. NEUPOGEN  (filgrastim) We market NEUPOGEN  , a recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. NEUPOGEN  was launched in 1991 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in people with certain types of cancer (non-myeloid) who receive anti-cancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. Other Marketed Products We market several other products, including KYPROLIS  (carfilzomib), Vectibix  (panitumumab), Nplate  (romiplostim), Repatha  (evolocumab), BLINCYTO  (blinatumomab), IMLYGIC  (talimogene laherparepvec) and Corlanor  (ivabradine).

Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in research and development (RD) in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. Our competitive positions may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product. See Government Regulation. We expect the adverse impact from biosimilars to be more like branded biologics than generic small molecules. Although we expect biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. Zarxio  , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  from Sandoz, a Novartis company (Sandoz), which launched in the United States in 2015, was the first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market. Companies have pending applications with the FDA for biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  and Neulasta  , along with additional biosimilar versions of NEUPOGEN  . We are well positioned to compete and will leverage the experience we have had in the United States versus branded competition, as well as our considerable experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates (as used in this document, clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies). See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future.

In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare. Their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs, and in particular specialty drugs such as our products, remain a focus for cost containment by these parties. As a result, payers around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. The scrutiny of biopharmaceutical pricing in the United States remains intense and a point of focus in the discussion of rising healthcare costs. The pricing practices of certain companies have increased public media and government scrutiny of the biopharmaceutical industry, providing greater incentive for governments and private payers to limit or regulate the price of drug products and services. At the same time, value assessments of new technology, previously used predominantly outside the United States, are having an impact in the U.S. healthcare environment. Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing. Although these organizations do not set drug prices, they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments, often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product. These developments put greater pressure on access to, pricing of and sales of our products. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. We are required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products we sell to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. The timing and method of repeal and replacement legislation is uncertain but changes could include the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provided. Further efforts by government agencies and state legislatures in the United States could also affect us and our industry. For example, a recently enacted Vermont law requires manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to the state attorney general if certain price increase and state spending thresholds are met. Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated, but not yet enacted, include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers. Other legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, including for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease; changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for payment in Medicare or Medicaid; and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars, including the current Medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policies intended to encourage biosimilar adoption, or other policies that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantages. In the U.S. private sector, healthcare providers and payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug spending altogether or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out of pocket costs and stricter utilization criteria before a patient may get access to a drug. In the retail pharmacy sector, in which the majority of our sales for ENBREL, Sensipar  and Repatha  occur, the use of such measures by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and insurers has continued to intensify which have limited Amgen product usage and revenues. PBMs are third-party organizations tasked with administrating prescription drug programs for large employers, health plans and government programs. Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States; for example three PBMs oversee approximately 75% of covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments, and/or to mandate stricter utilization criteria. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. Recent experience with Repatha  underscores that utilization management requirements continue to be onerous for patients and physicians, limiting access to appropriate usage. In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position. A drugs favorable position on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access. In general, in countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increased budgetary constraints, payers in many countries apply a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic reference pricing, increases in mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. For example, many Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are proliferating in established and emerging markets. The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products, and the industry as a whole. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to enable patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:  investing billions of dollars annually in research and development;  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably-supplied biosimilars;  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;  providing patient support and education programs and helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and ##TABLE_START  working with policymakers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers. ##TABLE_END See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk FactorsGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. We perform most of our bulk manufacturing, formulation, and/or fill and finish activities in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, California and Ireland facilities and also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands. In addition, we utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement our commercial manufacturing requirements. We manufacture products to support our clinical trials primarily in our California and Rhode Island locations. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards. Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or mitigating manufacturing risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. We have initiated the bulk process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore. Upon licensure, this facility will expand our capability to manufacture cell culture products utilizing new technology and innovation. The facility will be fully reconfigurable, providing efficient manufacturing capabilities to help ensure supply of our products worldwide. Our first product to be manufactured in the facility will be denosumab. We are also constructing an additional new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS  . In addition to these initiatives, we have projects designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization, to continue our use of third-party contract manufacturers and to maintain a state of regulatory compliance. This includes manufacturing network consolidation initiatives as well as process improvements surrounding manufacturing. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices, including companion diagnostics, and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to assist us in authenticating the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products including global regulatory implications. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products, as well as the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products or an NDA for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application. Approval of Biosimilars .  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non-clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency. The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, as risk-benefit has previously been established. In order to preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, some of which remain in draft form. As of the end of 2016, four biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA, including AMJEVITA  . A number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway, some of which are for biosimilars of our products. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. health care fraud and abuse laws. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation Outside the United States In the European Union (EU) countries as well as Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan , regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product which is not authorized in any Member State; a decentralized procedure; and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies.  Regulatory review is led by one Member State (the Reference Member State) and its assessment  based on safety, quality and efficacy  is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other Member States from which the applicant is seeking approval (the Concerned Member States). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMAs CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP  s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU, and in some cases rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Thailand, and Indonesia, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive timeframes. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., South Korea, India, Australia, Singapore and Taiwan) and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea). In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby the manufacturer must establish that its medical device conforms to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements. Post-approval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events reported following the use of our products through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies, as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and we currently have REMS for Prolia  , Nplate  and BLINCYTO  , as well as for our erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which includes EPOGEN  and Aranesp  . Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. In 2012, Amgen announced it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgens promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness in the areas of oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. We take a modality-independent approach to RD with a focus on biologics. We use cutting-edge science and technology to study the subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, or other combination or new modalities. Human genetic validation is used whenever possible to enhance the likelihood of success. For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , our RD expenses were $3.8 billion , $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion , respectively. We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States (including Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts), in Iceland and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. We conduct clinical trial activities by using both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government RegulationClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 13, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing. The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include the biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/Condition Phase 3 Programs   Aranesp   Myelodysplastic syndromes BLINCYTO   ALL ENBREL  Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis remission Erenumab  Episodic migraine EVENITY   Postmenopausal osteoporosis; Male osteoporosis IMLYGIC   Metastatic melanoma KYPROLIS   Multiple myeloma Omecamtiv mecarbil  Chronic heart failure Prolia   Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Repatha   Hyperlipidemia Vectibix   Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) XGEVA   Delay or prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer; Cancer-related bone damage in patients with multiple myeloma Phase 2 Programs   BLINCYTO   Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL); R/R Ph+ and minimal residual disease of ALL Erenumab  Chronic migraine AMG 157  Asthma; Atopic dermatitis AMG 520  Alzheimers disease AMG 899  Dyslipidemia Phase 1 Programs   IMLYGIC   Various cancer types KYPROLIS   Small-cell lung cancer Oprozomib  Multiple myeloma AMG 176  Various cancer types AMG 211  Various cancer types AMG 224  Multiple myeloma AMG 301  Migraine AMG 330  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 420  Multiple myeloma AMG 557  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 570  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 592  Inflammatory diseases AMG 820  Various cancer types AMG 986  Heart failure ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study; typically performed with registrational intent.

Geographic Area Financial Information For financial information concerning the geographic areas in which we operate, see Part IVNote 19, Segment informationGeographic information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investor Information Financial and other information about us is available on our website at www.amgen.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, we have previously filed registration statements and other documents with the SEC. Any document we file may be inspected, without charge, at the SECs public reference room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or at the SECs website at www.sec.gov. These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing. Information related to the operation of the SECs public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 800-SEC-0330. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. The statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal government. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions. U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. lawmakers have made statements about potentially repealing and/or replacing the ACA, although specific legislation for such a repeal or replacement has not yet been introduced. While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how our products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers our business could be adversely impacted. For example, discussions continue about proposals that would allow the U.S. federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers or require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed.  State government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced. Many states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation, including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, Ohio voters are expected to consider in their November 2017 election a ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying a greater price for drugs than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Passage of this proposition could lead to the introduction of additional ballot initiatives in other states. Legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing such discounts and rebates and limiting patient access and usage. Three PBMs currently oversee approximately 75% of total covered lives in the United States. Payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, and some payers may attempt to limit the use of programs assisting commercial patients with their co-payments. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products, such as by requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, since the launch of Repatha  in August 2015, the application of utilization management criteria by some payers, including PBMs, has resulted in denials of coverage for a significant number of patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed, slowing Repatha  sales. In early February 2017, we announced that our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint. See Item 1. BusinessSignificant Developments. However, in the current competitive environment, the application of restrictive utilization management criteria by some payers may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling, or even thereafter. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to U.S. government healthcare programs. Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future. We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar competition in the next year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could accelerate such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate. In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated and authorized pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries have adopted or are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products, and other countries may adopt similar measures. Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. In the United States, the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Sandozs Zarxio  , is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  , and was launched in the United States in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including a biosimilar version of ENBREL. In addition, a growing number of companies have announced that they are in varying stages of development of biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including biosimilars that would compete with our products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to, challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For information related to our biosimilars patent litigation, including our litigation regarding ENBREL, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products or could encourage prescribers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity, which could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States and Europe in the next year and beyond as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This biosimilar competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets.  We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDL-C levels. However, the FDA ultimately approved Repatha  only for a subset of those patients, citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events. We subsequently announced that our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint. See Item 1. BusinessSignificant Developments. However, we cannot predict the degree to which the results of this study will be incorporated into the Repatha  label by regulators. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels. Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in December 2014, we received accelerated approval for BLINCYTO  for the treatment of patients with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in the United States, with continued approval contingent upon clinical benefit in subsequent trials. BLINCYTO  also received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL from the EC in November 2015. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirements on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products.  Similarly, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationPost-Approval Phase) we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks, and vary in the elements they contain. For example, our ESA REMS requires applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS, and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of certain portions of our REMS. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: ##TABLE_START  revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; ##TABLE_END  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. For example, since 2006, when adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed, ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, changes to ESA labeling, our ESA REMS and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, questions remain as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products and what information can be included in biosimilar labeling. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure first-to-market positions, our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD. Amgen invests heavily in RD. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals;  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined. A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in May 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or create a shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In such diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. In addition, Vectibix  is used in combination with a test kit (which is a companion diagnostic device), and some of our product candidates may also be used in combination with a companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. Actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and impacts to our products. See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and are currently and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, including the requirement to provide 180 days notice in advance of commercial marketing. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover from the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products. While we may attempt to challenge such patents, our efforts may be unsuccessful. For information related to our biosimilars patent litigation, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the existing patents on our products have recently expired. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies, and a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical products. These assessments may come from private organizations, such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers. In addition, government HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such HTA organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies, or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax. Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IVNote 5, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. President Trump has indicated that U.S. corporate tax reform is a high priority for his Administration, and the U.S. Congress is expected to propose sweeping changes to the U.S. tax system including changes to corporate tax rates, the taxation of income earned outside the U.S. (including the taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings), as well as a potential destination-based tax system. A change to the U.S. tax system, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, such as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or a change in tax law in other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Insulet Corporation is our single source of the on-body injector for our Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and ##TABLE_END  labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters. These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product use and sales and our business and results of operations. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. BusinessManufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:  capacity of manufacturing facilities;  contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters;  compliance with regulatory requirements;  changes in forecasts of future demand;  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;  updates of manufacturing specifications;  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;  timing and outcome of product quality testing;  power failures and/or other utility failures; and/or  breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. We have initiated the drug substance process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore. This Singapore facility will utilize a novel manufacturing technology that has not been previously approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we are in the process of commercially validating and licensing a new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS  . If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for either of these facilities on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials. We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. The operation of our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico is also subject to local economic challenges. Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the governments liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility, and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring. The establishment of the Oversight Board initially provided for an automatic stay of creditor actions against the Puerto Rico government until February 15, 2017, and recently extended the automatic stay until May 1, 2017. The Puerto Rico government is expected to submit a fiscal plan to the Oversight Board by February 28, 2017. Additionally, on January 29, 2017, the Puerto Rico government signed into law the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act (the Act), which is intended to facilitate and encourage a voluntary negotiation process under PROMESA between the Puerto Rico government and its creditors. The Act declares a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico until May 1, 2017, and authorizes the Governor to designate certain services as essential services, and other services as non-essential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Ricos obligations. While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Ricos economic situation could impact the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and/or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and free-standing dialysis clinic businesses and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for approximately 75% of all EPOGEN  sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that three PBMs now oversee approximately 75% of total covered lives in the United States. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. The concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively impacting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. For example, on October 1, 2013, we acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Onyx), a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process, and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. These legal and operational challenges along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales, business and results of operations. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. In connection with that settlement, we are now operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until December 2017. The CIA also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance program. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the CIA, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. We may also be subject to actions by government entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct that is the subject of the settlement. We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure, network connected control systems and data security. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure, network connected control systems and data security. The breadth, complexity and business process integration of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make these systems targets of service interruption, destruction, malicious intrusion and attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees, contractors or others may pose risks that sensitive data including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging us, our patients, customers and/or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or the public. As a global biotechnology company, our systems are subject to frequent cyber-attacks. Moreover, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, such attacks are also increasingly difficult to detect when carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors including nation states and organized crime groups. Such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, key loggers, a denial-of-service, a delivery of malware through malicious websites, the use of social engineering and/or other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, processes, infrastructure and data. Key business partners, third-party service and product providers and any companies we may acquire face similar risks and any security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security and resiliency posture. Although in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. While we continue to invest in the protection and monitoring of our critical or sensitive data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or detect all breaches to our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially impacted. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Overview Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve peoples lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the worlds leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our strategy is to develop innovative medicines in six focused therapeutic areas that meet important unmet medical needs in addressing serious illness. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide focusing on: oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Our principal products include ENBREL, Neulasta  , Aranesp  , Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , XGEVA  , EPOGEN  , and NEUPOGEN  . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. In 2016, we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities with strong execution across the business. ##TABLE_START  Over the past year, our financial performance was strong, as total revenues increased 6%. Net income increased 11% and diluted EPS increased by 13% driven by higher total revenues and continued improvement in operating leverage enabled by the transformation initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our pipeline continued to advance with the U.S. regulatory filing for EVENITY  , approval of Parsabiv  in the EU, and in early 2017, approval in the United States. We announced positive phase 2 and phase 3 results for erenumab for chronic and episodic migraine, respectively, and positive phase 3 results for XGEVA  for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We also announced positive phase 3 results for Repatha  for the treatment of coronary artery disease and in early 2017, positive top-line results in our phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes and cognitive function trials. We received new indications for KYPROLIS  , Nplate  , BLINCYTO  and ENBREL. Additionally, we continued to advance our biosimilar program, including the U.S. approval and EU regulatory submission for AMJEVITA  / ABP 501, global regulatory submission of ABP 215, and phase 3 data for ABP 980. Throughout the course of the year, we invested in external early-stage innovation to augment our internal research efforts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We built the foundation for long-term growth through our product launches in new parts of the world, as seen by our ability to secure 94 country product launches. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that build on our expertise in manufacturing, including our new Singapore facility for which licensure is under way. We believe that our next-generation biomanufacturing will reduce the scale and cost of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We continue to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate our products, as seen by our U.S. launch of the Repatha  Pushtronex  system, a new monthly single-dose administration option, and the continued growth of the Neulasta  OnPro  kit in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flows from operating activities grew 6% to $10.4 billion, enabling us to invest for the future and return capital to shareholders, consistent with our expectations for long-term growth. We increased our dividend 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2017. We also repurchased 19.7 million shares of our common stock throughout 2016 at an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We have focused our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts. Our transformation has established a foundation for longer-term growth and we are approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence. ##TABLE_END While 2016 execution was strong, we expect 2017 to be an increasingly challenging environment. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products will face increasing pressure from competitive product launches, including from biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents and see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. We believe we are well positioned for the challenges and opportunities in the coming year. Challenges and opportunities led us to begin our transformation at Amgen, which will continue to be an important part of our strategy and execution. We have enthusiasm for the future and long-term growth based on innovative medicines that make a difference for patients suffering from serious illness. We are focused on executing our strategy and delivering results. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change  Product sales:      U.S. $ 17,325  %  $ 16,523 Rest of world (ROW) 4,567  %  4,421 Total product sales 21,892  %  20,944 Other revenues 1,099  %  Total revenues $ 22,991  %  $ 21,662 Operating expenses $ 13,197   %  $ 13,192 Operating income $ 9,794  %  $ 8,470 Net income $ 7,722  %  $ 6,939 Diluted EPS $ 10.24  %  $ 9.06 Diluted shares  (2 )%  ##TABLE_ENDIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. U.S. product sales for 2016 increased across the portfolio except for EPOGEN  and NEUPOGEN  , which declined by 31% and 33%, respectively. The U.S. increase was driven primarily by increases in net selling prices. The increase in ROW product sales for 2016 was driven primarily by higher unit demand from new product launches, offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices. Operating expenses for 2016 were flat as the savings from transformation and process improvement efforts were offset by increased support for launch products . Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2016, 2015 or 2014. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  ENBREL $ 5,965  %  $ 5,364  %  $ 4,688 Neulasta  4,648  (1 )%  4,715  %  4,596 Aranesp  2,093  %  1,951  %  1,930 Prolia  1,635  %  1,312  %  1,030 Sensipar  /Mimpara  1,582  %  1,415  %  1,158 XGEVA  1,529  %  1,405  %  1,221 EPOGEN  1,282  (31 )%  1,856  (9 )%  2,031 NEUPOGEN   (27 )%  1,049  (9 )%  1,159 Other products 2,393  %  1,877  %  1,514 Total product sales $ 21,892  %  $ 20,944  %  $ 19,327 Total U.S. $ 17,325  %  $ 16,523  %  $ 14,732 Total ROW 4,567  %  4,421  (4 )%  4,595 Total product sales $ 21,892  %  $ 20,944  %  $ 19,327 ##TABLE_ENDFuture sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  ENBREL  U.S. $ 5,719  %  $ 5,099  %  $ 4,404 ENBREL  Canada  (7 )%   (7 )%  Total ENBREL $ 5,965  % $ 5,364  %  $ 4,688 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in ENBREL sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by the impact of competition. In 2017, we expect intensifying competition and relatively little benefit from net selling price changes. Neulasta   Total Neulasta  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,925  %  $ 3,891  %  $ 3,649 Neulasta   ROW  (12 )%   (13 )%  Total Neulasta  $ 4,648  (1 )% $ 4,715  %  $ 4,596 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in global Neulasta  sales for 2016 was driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of the end of December 2016, utilization of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit continues to grow in the United States. The increase in global Neulasta  sales for 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our final material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta  . Apotex, Inc. (Apotex), Sandoz and Coherus BioSciences, Inc., announced that the FDA has accepted their applications for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta  . Novartis indicated that it received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Apotex and Sandoz, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) will expire in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents. Future Neulasta  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  Aranesp   U.S. $ 1,082  %  $  %  $ Aranesp   ROW 1,011  (4 )%  1,051  (7 )%  1,136 Total Aranesp  $ 2,093  % $ 1,951  %  $ 1,930 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global Aranesp  sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven by unit demand growth, including a shift from EPOGEN   in the United States, offset partially by  a decrease in net selling price in ROW.

The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2015 was driven by a decline in unit demand resulting from competition and a shift in dialysis sales to A ranesp  , offset partially by an increase in net selling price. Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN  expired in May 2015. There is competition in the United States, which has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on EPOGEN  sales. Further in December 2014, Hospira, Inc. (Hospira), a subsidiary of Pfizer, submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit  , a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN  . For discussion of ongoing litigation between us and Hospira, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NEUPOGEN   Total NEUPOGEN  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,    Year ended December 31,   Change   Change  NEUPOGEN   U.S. $  (33 )%  $  (5 )%  $ NEUPOGEN   ROW  (10 )%   (20 )%  Total NEUPOGEN  $  (27 )% $ 1,049  (9 )%  $ 1,159 ##TABLE_ENDThe decreases in global NEUPOGEN  sales for 2016 and 2015 were driven by a decline in unit demand due primarily to the impact of short-acting competition in the United States. There is competition, which has intensified and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of NEUPOGEN  . We expect competitive trends to continue into 2017 from existing branded and new and existing biosimilar competition. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition and Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of ongoing litigation. Future NEUPOGEN  sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The transformation includes a restructuring plan that will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million . As of December 31, 2016, restructuring costs incurred to date were $709 million. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring costs of $37 million, $114 million and $558 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2017 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.2 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings were not significant in 2016, 2015 and 2014 as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IVNote 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 18.1% of total revenues for 2016, driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies. Cost of sales decreased to 19.5% of total revenues for 2015, driven primarily by lower royalties, higher net selling prices, manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs related to our restructuring plan. The year ended December 31, 2014, also had a $99 million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) is recorded as a cost of sales expense. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 16.5%, 17.8% and 20.1% of total revenues for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Research and development The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description DRTS  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later-stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    DRTS $ 1,039  $  $ 1,212 Later-stage clinical programs 1,054  1,876  2,287 Marketed products 1,747  1,197  Total RD expense $ 3,840  $ 4,070  $ 4,297 ##TABLE_ENDThe decreases in RD expenses for 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical programs support of $822 million and $411 million, respectively, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed products support of $550 million and $399 million, respectively. All categories of RD spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. The decreases were offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the company, including increases in DRTS for up-front milestone payments related to several collaboration transactions. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs. Selling, general and administrative The increase in Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense for 2016 was driven primarily by further investments in product launches, offset partially by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016. The increase in SGA expense for 2015 was driven primarily by new product launches, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts under our restructuring plan. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 12% in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Other Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings, certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, including separation costs of $49 million, $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior year business combination, and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures. Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPRD program acquired in a prior year business combination. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Interest expense, net $ 1,260  $ 1,095  $ 1,071 Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provision for income taxes $ 1,441  $ 1,039  $ Effective tax rate 15.7 %  13.0 %  7.6 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The increases in interest expense, net in 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the respective prior year. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances in 2016, offset partially by higher gains on strategic equity investments in 2015. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances with a modestly higher portfolio yield, offset partially by higher net losses on sales of interest bearing securities in 2015. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and lower domestic restructuring costs in 2015. The effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 would have been approximately 18.6%, 16.4% and 12.8%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesIncome taxes and Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015, and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2017. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of our common stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, $4.1 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively, U.S. funds) are adequate to continue meeting our U.S. obligations, including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds, for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $38.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 , approximately $35.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2016 , were $ 4.4 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015 , were $ 2.2 billion and $ 29.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, Standard  Poors Financial Services LLC (SP), Moodys Investor Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Fitch Ratings Inc. assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $7.3 billion, $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014, we repaid debt of $3.7 billion, $2.4 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.65 billion. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2016 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, although we anticipate utilizing the commercial paper program in 2017. In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires on February 23, 2017, and is expected to be renewed before its expiration date. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of December 31, 2016 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,354  $ 9,731  $ 8,952 Net cash used in investing activities $ (8,658 )  $ (5,547 )  $ (5,752 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,599 )  $ (3,771 )  $ (3,274 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 due primarily to an improved operating margin and the timing of customer payments, offset partially by inventory build, the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015 and the timing of tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2015 due primarily to improvement in our operating margin and the monetization of foreign currency contracts that resulted in the receipt of $340 million in cash, offset by the timing of payments to vendors and cash received from customers. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 738 million, $ 594 million and $ 718 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. We currently estimate 2017 spending on capital projects and equipment to be consistent with 2016 spend. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 359 million and $ 165 million , respectively. Net cash invested in marketable securities was $7.7 billion , $4.4 billion and $5.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, restricted investments provided $533 million in 2014. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $3.7 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $ 3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $ 260 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7.3 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $2.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion , withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $ 401 million and the settlement of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a business of $253 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $3.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion , withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $225 million and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Companys equity award programs of $186 million . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Payments due by period as of December 31, 2016    Year  Years  Years  Years Contractual obligations Total   2 and 3  4 and 5  6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 57,297  $ 5,741  $ 7,009  $ 7,612  $ 36,935 Operating lease obligations (5)     Purchase obligations (6) 2,914  1,592    Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7)          Total contractual obligations $ 60,998  $ 7,489  $ 7,833  $ 8,128  $ 37,548 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2016 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $39 million. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2016 , in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2016 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Operating lease obligations exclude $228 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Dezima Pharma B.V. (Dezima) and Biovex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $7.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisitions of Dezima and BioVex. See Part IVNote 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of January 1, 2014 $  $  $  $ 1,248 Amounts charged against product sales 2,499  3,399   6,586 Payments (2,274 )  (3,454 )  (727 )  (6,455 ) Balance as of December 31, 2014 1,120    1,379 Amounts charged against product sales 2,734  4,275   7,741 Payments (2,735 )  (4,198 )  (701 )  (7,634 ) Balance as of December 31, 2015 1,119    1,486 Amounts charged against product sales 3,479  5,270   9,654 Payments (3,181 )  (5,201 )  (884 )  (9,266 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 1,417  $  $  $ 1,874 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , total sales deductions were 31%, 27% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to our foreign income associated with our operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. (Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , was composed of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $37.6 billion and $31.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of approximately $900 million and $840 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2016 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $34.6 billion and a fair value of $36.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $31.4 billion and a fair value of $33.1 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates as the carrying values of variable rate debt were $1.5 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.65 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $240 million and $290 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros/pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $450 million and $210 million, respectively. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2016 , we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $5.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015 , we had euro and pound sterling denominated debt with a carrying value and fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $1.2 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $660 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $610 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $1.2 billion and $610 million on these dates, respectively. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2016 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $608 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.3 billion and $225 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of these contracts were approximately $200 million and $140 million, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2016 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $300 million. With regard to contracts that were open at December 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $320 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $666 million and $911 million , respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by SP and Moodys and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2016 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. We have audited Amgen Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Amgen Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Amgen Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Amgen Inc. and our report dated February 14, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 14, 2017  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 150% of the performance units granted prior to 2016 and 200% of performance units granted in 2016. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2016, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes: (i) 3,137,900 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $100.21; (ii) 4,161,174 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 197,371 related dividend equivalents); and (iii)  2,862,798 shares subject to outstanding 2014, 2015 and 2016 performance units (including 126,398 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2016, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 150% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2014 and 2015 and 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2016. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants.

Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and in early 2018. Products/Pipeline Bone health Prolia  (denosumab) ##TABLE_START  In October 2017, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Prolia  for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. The sBLA is based on a phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia  compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of May 28, 2018. ##TABLE_END XGEVA   (denosumab) ##TABLE_START  In April 2017, we announced the submission of an application for a variation to the marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for XGEVA  . The submission to the regulatory authority seeks to expand the currently approved XGEVA  indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In January 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the sBLA for XGEVA  to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In February 2018, we announced that a phase 3 study of XGEVA  for a potential new indication as adjuvant treatment for women with high-risk, early stage breast cancer receiving standard of care neoadjuvant or adjuvant cancer therapy did not meet its primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival. ##TABLE_END EVENITY  (romosozumab)* ##TABLE_START  In May 2017, we and UCB, our global collaboration partner in the development of EVENITY  , announced that the EVENITY  ARCH (Active-contRolled FraCture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk of Fracture) study met both primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint. An imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed in the study as a new safety signal. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In July 2017, we and UCB announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for EVENITY  as a treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. We intend to provide a resubmission, which will include data from the phase 3 ARCH study and select data from the phase 3 BRIDGE (PlaceBo-contRolled Study EvaluatIng the Efficacy anD Safety of Romosozumab in TreatinG mEn with Osteoporosis) study evaluating EVENITY  in men with osteoporosis, in addition to the phase 3 FRAME (FRActure study in postmenopausal ##TABLE_ENDwoMen with ostEoporosis) study. We are currently evaluating all EVENITY  data and will be working in close collaboration with the FDA. ##TABLE_START  In January 2018, we and UCB announced that the EMA accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for EVENITY  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. ##TABLE_END Cardiovascular Repatha  (evolocumab) ##TABLE_START  In February 2017, we announced that the European Commission (EC) adopted a decision to change the Repatha  marketing authorization, approving a new single-dose, monthly delivery option. The new automated mini-doser with a pre-filled cartridge is a hands-free device that provides 420 mg of Repatha  in a single injection per administration. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In March 2017, we announced that the phase 3 study evaluating Repatha  in patients who were receiving apheresis to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) met its primary endpoint. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In June 2017, we announced the submission of an application for a variation to the marketing authorization to the EMA for Repatha  . The regulatory submission is based on the Repatha  cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In October 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a ruling that reversed in part the decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware that had prohibited Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from infringing two patents that we hold for Repatha  by manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale or importing alirocumab in the United States. See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In October 2017, we announced that a phase 3 study of Repatha  on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia met its co-primary endpoints of the percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C at week 12 and the mean percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C at weeks 10 and 12. No new safety findings were identified. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In December 2017, we announced that following priority review of our sBLA, the FDA approved Repatha  as the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease based on data from the Repatha  cardiovascular outcomes study. The FDA also approved Repatha  to be used as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to lower LDL-C. The new label also included data from the Repatha  cognitive function study showing Repatha  was non-inferior to placebo on selected cognitive function domains as assessed with the use of neuropsychological function tests over a median follow-up of 19 months. ##TABLE_END Neuroscience Aimovig  (erenumab)* ##TABLE_START  In April 2017, we announced an expanded collaboration with Novartis AG (Novartis) for Aimovig  , which is being investigated for the prevention of migraine. As part of the expanded collaboration, Amgen and Novartis agreed to combine capabilities to co-commercialize Aimovig  in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In July 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the BLA for Aimovig  for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of May 17, 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In January 2018, a phase 3b study met its primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints in patients with episodic migraine who had experienced two to four previous preventive treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. ##TABLE_END Oncology/Hematology Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) ##TABLE_START  In October 2017, we announced that after a recommendation by the data safety monitoring committee, a phase 3 post-marketing requirement study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aranesp  in anemic patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy was terminated early. The study successfully met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in overall survival compared to placebo, with no new safety findings. ##TABLE_ENDBLINCYTO  (blinatumomab) ##TABLE_START  In July 2017, we announced that the FDA approved the sBLA for BLINCYTO  to include overall survival data from the phase 3 TOWER study. The approval converted BLINCYTO  s accelerated approval to a full approval. The approval expanded the indication of BLINCYTO  for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults and children. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In December 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review the sBLA for the treatment of minimal residual disease in patients with ALL. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of March 29, 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In February 2018, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for BLINCYTO  to include overall survival data from the phase 3 TOWER study supporting the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to a full marketing authorization in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. ##TABLE_END KYPROLIS  (carfilzomib) ##TABLE_START  In July 2017, we announced positive results from the final analysis of the phase 3 ASPIRE (CArfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and DexamethaSone versus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of PatIents with Relapsed Multiple MyEloma) study. The study met the key secondary endpoint of overall survival, demonstrating that KYPROLIS  , lenalidomide and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21% over lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In October 2017, we announced top-line results of the phase 3 ARROW (RAndomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with Dexamethasone, Comparing Once-Weekly versus Twice-weekly Carfilzomib Dosing) study, which showed KYPROLIS  administered once-weekly at the 70 mg/m 2 dose with dexamethasone allowed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients to live 3.6 months longer without their disease worsening than KYPROLIS  administered twice-weekly at the 27 mg/m 2 dose with dexamethasone. The overall safety profile of the once-weekly KYPROLIS  regimen was comparable to that of the twice-weekly regimen. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In December 2017, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA and a variation to the Marketing Authorization to the EMA to include the overall survival data from the ASPIRE study in the product label. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In January 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA to add overall survival data from the phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR study to the prescribing information for KYPROLIS  . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In January 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for KYPROLIS  to include updated overall survival data from the phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR (RandomizEd, OpeN Label, Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib Plus DExamethAsone Vs Bortezomib Plus DexamethasOne in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ENDEAVOR study demonstrated that KYPROLIS  and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21 percent, and increased overall survival by 7.6 months versus VELCADE  (bortezomib) and dexamethasone.  ##TABLE_END Vectibix  (panitumumab) ##TABLE_START  In June 2017, we announced that the FDA approved the sBLA for Vectibix  to more precisely define patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.  ##TABLE_END Nephrology Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) ##TABLE_START  In August 2017, we announced that the EC granted Marketing Authorization of a pediatric formulation (granules in capsule for opening) of Mimpara  for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in children aged three years and older with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom sHPT is not adequately controlled with standard of care therapy. ##TABLE_ENDBiosimilars AMJEVITA  (adalimumab-atto) / AMGEVITA  (biosimilar adalimumab) ##TABLE_START  In March 2017, we announced that the EC granted market authorization for AMGEVITA  , a biosimilar to AbbVies HUMIRA  , in all available indications. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In September 2017, we announced that we have reached a global settlement with AbbVie to resolve all pending litigation regarding AMJEVITA  /AMGEVITA  . Under terms of the agreement, AbbVie will grant patent licenses for the use and sale of AMJEVITA  /AMGEVITA  worldwide, on a country-by-country basis, and the companies have agreed to dismiss all pending patent litigation. We expect to launch AMGEVITA  in Europe in October 2018 and AMJEVITA  in the United States in January 2023. ##TABLE_END ABP 980 ##TABLE_START  In March 2017, we announced the submission of a MAA to the EMA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin  (trastuzumab). ABP 980 is being developed in collaboration with Allergan plc (Allergan). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In October 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review a BLA for ABP 980. The FDA has set a Biosimilar User Fee Act target action date of May 28, 2018. ##TABLE_END MVASI  (bevacizumab-awwb) ##TABLE_START  In September 2017, we announced that the FDA approved MVASI  for all eligible indications of the reference product, Avastin  . MVASI  is the first anti-cancer biosimilar, as well as the first bevacizumab biosimilar, approved by the FDA. MVASI  is approved for the treatment of five types of cancer. MVASI  is being developed in collaboration with Allergan. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In January 2018, we announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for MVASI  (biosimilar bevacizumab) for the treatment of certain types of cancers . ##TABLE_END Next-generation biomanufacturing ##TABLE_START  In May 2017, our next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Singapore was approved by the FDA for certain commercial production. ##TABLE_END 2017 U.S. Tax Reform ##TABLE_START  On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted major tax reform legislation, Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). The 2017 Tax Act imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END Offer to Purchase Common Stock ##TABLE_START  On February 5, 2018, we announced a tender offer to purchase up to $10 billion of our common stock at a price not greater than $200 per share nor less than $175 per share. The tender is based on our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business, enhanced by the 2017 Tax Act, and is consistent with our ongoing objective to return capital to our stockholders. The tender offer expires at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of Monday, March 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended. ##TABLE_END * FDA provisionally approved trade name Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by partnering with third parties. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third-partys varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors that are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products directly to consumers through several direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media, as well as through multi-channel marketing. For further discussion, see Government RegulationRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 96% , 96% and 97% of our U.S. gross product sales, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 81% of worldwide gross revenues for each of these years. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance. For financial information related to our one business segment, see Part IVConsolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, and Note 19, Segment information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are marketed around the world with the United States being our largest market. The following chart shows our product sales by principal product and by geography for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015. Enbrel  (etanercept) We market ENBREL primarily in the United States. It was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: ##TABLE_START  moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  active psoriatic arthritis. ##TABLE_END Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim) We market Neulasta  , a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta  was launched in 2002, and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count, in patients with certain types of cancer (non-myeloid) who receive anti-cancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta  Onpro  kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta  Onpro  kit provides patients the opportunity to administer the recommended dose of Neulasta  at home the day after chemotherapy, saving a trip back to the doctor. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We market Aranesp  primarily in Europe and the United States. It was launched in 2001, and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) (in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis). Aranesp  is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid malignancies, and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp  . Aranesp  and EPOGEN  compete with each other in the United States, primarily in the dialysis setting. Prolia  (denosumab) We market Prolia  primarily in the United States and Europe. Prolia  contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA  but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia  is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) We market cinacalcet as Sensipar  primarily in the United States and as Mimpara  primarily in Europe. It was launched in 2004 and is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of sHPT in adult patients with CKD who are on dialysis. XGEVA  (denosumab) We market XGEVA  primarily in the United States and Europe. XGEVA  was launched in the United States in 2010, and is used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, including multiple myeloma. XGEVA  was launched in Europe in 2011, and is used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, and was recently approved for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa) We market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. EPOGEN  was launched in 1989, and we market it for the indication to treat anemia caused by CKD in patients on dialysis to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. The majority of our sales are to a large dialysis provider. Other Marketed Products We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS  (carfilzomib), Vectibix  (panitumumab), Nplate  (romiplostim), NEUPOGEN  (filgrastim), Repatha  (evolocumab), BLINCYTO  (blinatumomab), IMLYGIC  (talimogene laherparepvec), Corlanor  (ivabradine) and Parsabiv  (etelcalcetide). Patents The following table describes our outstanding material patents for the indicated product by territory, general subject matter and latest expiry date. Certain of the European patents are the subject of supplemental protection certificates that provide additional protection for the product in certain European countries beyond the dates listed in the table (see footnotes).

A number of our marketed products are indicated in disease areas where other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development (RD) activities. We continue to pursue ways to increase the value of our medicines through innovations during their lifecycles. This can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, in 2015, we launched the Neulasta  Onpro  kit, which provides patients the opportunity to administer the recommended dose of Neulasta  at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving a trip back to the doctor. We also developed the AutoTouch  reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini  single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL), which was approved by the FDA in September 2017. The Enbrel Mini  utilizes a new drug formulation of ENBREL that was associated with substantially significant lower mean injection site pain than the current formulation. We plan to continue pursuing such innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product. See Government Regulation. We expect that the adverse impact from biosimilars will be more like branded biologic competition than that seen when branded small molecules face generics. Although we expect biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. Zarxio  , a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  from Sandoz, a Novartis company (Sandoz), which launched in the United States in 2015, was the first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market. Companies have pending applications with the FDA for biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  and Neulasta  , along with additional biosimilar versions of NEUPOGEN  . See also Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars. As biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage both the experience we have had in the United States versus branded competition, and our experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A.

See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information. Several of these generic versions of Sensipar  have been tentatively approved by the FDA. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  A subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  KYPROLIS  is facing increased competition from several recently approved products. ##TABLE_ENDReimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain intensely focused on reducing the cost of healthcare. Their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs, and in particular specialty drugs such as our products, remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are being more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products, while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. In the United States, biopharmaceutical product pricing remains central to discussions on controlling healthcare costs. The pricing practices of certain companies have increased public media and government scrutiny of the biopharmaceutical industry, providing greater incentive for governments and private payers to limit or regulate the prices of drug products and services. Policymakers from both major U.S. political parties, including key members of the presidential administration, have indicated their support for pursuing policies to lower drug costs for patients. At the same time, value assessments of new technologies, previously used predominantly outside the United States, are having an impact in the U.S. healthcare environment. Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing. Although these organizations do not set drug prices, they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments, often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product. In addition, continued consolidation of payers and integration of providers and payers (integrated delivery systems) increase the level of market power held by our customers. These developments put greater pressure on access to, pricing of and sales of our products. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. We are required to provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and also provide discounts to qualifying health care providers under the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. These rebates and/or discounts levels, as well as entities who are entitled to receive them, have increased over time. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us. The ACA also imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. The U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. In the tax reform bill signed by President Trump in December 2017, Congress removed a key ACA provision by repealing the individual mandate penalty which required each individual to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Future changes to government programs such as the ACA, whether legislative or regulatory, could impact the number of patient lives covered, could raise or lower the cost of quality insurance, could affect Medicaid eligibility and could change levels of patient protections provided unless alternatives are put in place. Additional efforts by state legislatures and government agencies in the United States could also affect us and our industry. For example, a recently enacted California law requires manufacturers to provide payers advance notice of a price increase over a specified threshold, and a Vermont law requires manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to the state attorney general if certain price increase and state-spending thresholds are met. Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated, but not yet enacted, include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers.  Other government legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, including for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease; changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for drug payment in Medicare or Medicaid; and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars, such as policies that would enable easier substitution for, or provide reimbursement advantages over, the corresponding innovative products. Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has indicated interest in testing new models for drug payment in Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS also continues to test alternative payment models with providers, such as the Oncology Care Model. These models provide financial incentives to providers who participate under which providers take on greater risk for the overall cost and quality of care. In addition, CMS recently finalized changes to Medicare payment to hospitals for Part B drugs acquired through the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program but provide financial incentive for hospitals to use biosimilar products over the corresponding innovative products. CMS is also proposing changes to Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. These and/or other changes have the potential to impact prescribing and patient access to Amgens therapies. In the U.S. private sector, payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and/or stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug. In the specialty pharmacy sector, in which the majority of our sales for ENBREL and Repatha  occur, the use of such measures by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and insurers has continued to intensify which have limited Amgen product usage and sales. PBMs are third-party organizations tasked with administrating prescription drug programs for large employers, health plans and government programs. Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments, and/or to mandate stricter utilization criteria. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. Our experience with Repatha  underscores that utilization management requirements, including the burdensome administrative processes required of physicians to demonstrate and document that patients meet such requirements, continue to be a significant challenge for patients and physicians, limiting access for appropriate usage. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions due to economic reasons. In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL and Repatha  , PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position. A drugs inclusion and favorable positioning on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access. In many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints, payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic reference pricing, increases in mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage, and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are expanding in established and emerging markets. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products, and the industry as a whole. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to enable patient access to needed medicines. We do this by: ##TABLE_START  investing billions of dollars annually in RD; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably-supplied biosimilars; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing patient support and education programs and helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  working with policymakers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers. ##TABLE_END See Item 1A.

Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in manufacturing of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. Our internal manufacturing network has the commercial production capabilities of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities, as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement our commercial manufacturing requirements. We utilize these internal facilities and third-party contract manufacturers to develop similar capabilities in multiple geographic areas to mitigate potential supply impacts of the most important risks facing our supply chain. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico causing some damage to our facility in Juncos. Critical manufacturing areas of our facility were not significantly affected, and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. Further recovery efforts on the island are ongoing. We have continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world. We manufacture products to support our clinical trials primarily at our California and Rhode Island facilities. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, our operations in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards. Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. In 2017, our new biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore was licensed by the FDA and EMA for certain commercial scale production. The Singapore facility was completed in approximately half the time typically required for conventional biomanufacturing equivalents. It utilizes a flexible and modular design that can be replicated in future facilities, enabling higher production and accessibility to patients around the world. The Singapore facility is fully reconfigurable, allowing the production of other products for worldwide supply. For example, in October 2017, we completed a second bulk process qualification campaign, which, if approved, would enable a second molecule to be manufactured at that facility. We also completed the construction of a second facility in Singapore and we are currently carrying out a qualification campaign. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to help authenticate the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products including global regulatory implications. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our products, as well as the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products or an New Drug Application for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application. Approval of Biosimilars .  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non-clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, as risk-benefit has previously been established. In order to preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, some of which remain in draft form. As of the end of 2017, seven biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA, including our products AMJEVITA  and MVASI  ,  as well as competitors to our products ENBREL and NEUPOGEN  . A number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway, some of which are for biosimilars of our products. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. health care fraud and abuse laws. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation Outside the United States In the European Union (EU) countries as well as Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product which is not authorized in any Member State; a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one Member State (the Reference Member State) and its assessmentbased on safety, quality and efficacyis reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other Member States from which the applicant is seeking approval (the Concerned Member States). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMAs CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. As a result of the vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the EU in March 2019, the EMA announced on November 20, 2017 that it will relocate its headquarters from London to Amsterdam by March 30, 2019. In addition to uncertainty regarding the supervision and regulation of our products in the UK, it is unclear what impact the EMA move will have on the EU marketing approval process. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU, and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive timeframes. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., South Korea, India, Australia, Singapore and Taiwan) and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea). In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby the manufacturer must establish that its medical device conforms to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements. Post-approval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine post-marketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies, as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and we currently have REMS for Prolia  , Nplate  and BLINCYTO  . Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. In 2012, Amgen announced it had finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgens promotional, contracting, sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Although the corporate integrity agreement term ended in December 2017, certain of the corporate integrity agreements reporting obligations to OIG continue into 2018. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness primarily in the areas of oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. We capitalize on our strength in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modality-independent approach to RD. We use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. Leveraging two decades of research at deCODE, a global leader in analyzing the human genome, we are reshaping our portfolio and increasingly focusing efforts on targets validated in humans. Human genetic validation is used whenever possible in order to enhance the likelihood of success. For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , our RD expenses were $3.6 billion, $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion , respectively. We have major RD centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Iceland and in the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government RegulationRegulation in the Unites StatesClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 12, 2018, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, non-registrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct non-registrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include the biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/condition Phase 3 Programs   Aimovig   Migraine prevention Aranesp   Myelodysplastic syndromes BLINCYTO   ALL ENBREL  Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis remission EVENITY   Postmenopausal osteoporosis; Male osteoporosis IMLYGIC   Metastatic melanoma KYPROLIS   Multiple myeloma Omecamtiv mecarbil  Chronic heart failure Prolia   Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis Tezepelumab  Asthma AMG 520 / CNP520  Alzheimers disease Phase 2 Programs   BLINCYTO   Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Tezepelumab  Atopic dermatitis AMG 301  Migraine prevention AMG 557  Primary Sj  grens syndrome AMG 714  Celiac disease Phase 1 Programs   IMLYGIC   Various cancer types KYPROLIS   Small-cell lung cancer Oprozomib  Multiple myeloma AMG 176  Various cancer types AMG 224  Multiple myeloma AMG 330  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 420  Multiple myeloma AMG 570  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 592  Inflammatory diseases AMG 596  Glioblastoma AMG 598  Obesity AMG 673  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 701  Multiple myeloma AMG 757  Small-cell lung cancer AMG 820  Various cancer types AMG 966  Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohns and ulcerative colitis) AMG 986  Heart failure ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Phase 3 Clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study; typically performed with registrational intent.

Phase 3 and 2 Program Descriptions The following text provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials. Aimovig   Aimovig  is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide. It is being evaluated for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig  is being developed jointly with Novartis. In July 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the BLA for Aimovig  for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of May 17, 2018. In January 2018, a phase 3b study met its primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints in patients with episodic migraine who had experienced two to four previous preventive treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. Aranesp   Aranesp  is a recombinant human protein agonist of the erythropoietin receptor. I t is being investigated as a treatment for low risk myelodysplastic syndromes. In October 2017, we announced that a phase 3 post-marketing requirement study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aranesp  in anemic patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy successfully met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in overall survival compared to placebo, with no new safety findings. BLINCYTO   BLINCYTO  is an anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 (BiTE  ) bispecific antibody construct. A phase 2/3 study in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL is ongoing. In December 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review the sBLA for the treatment of minimal residual disease in patients with ALL. The PDUFA target action date is March 29, 2018. In July 2017, we announced that the FDA approved the sBLA for BLINCYTO  to include overall survival data from the phase 3 TOWER study. The approval converts BLINCYTO  s accelerated approval to a full approval. The approval expands the indication of BLINCYTO  for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children. In February 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for BLINCYTO  to include overall survival data from the phase 3 TOWER study supporting the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to a full marketing authorization in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. ENBREL ENBREL is a fusion protein that inhibits tumor necrosis factor. Phase 3 studies to evaluate ENBREL as a monotherapy for psoriatic arthritis treatment and as a monotherapy in maintaining remission in rheumatoid arthritis are ongoing. EVENITY   EVENITY  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin. It is being evaluated as a treatment for osteoporosis. EVENITY  is being developed in collaboration with UCB. In May 2017, we and UCB announced that the phase 3 ARCH study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis met both primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint. An imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed in the study as a new safety signal. In July 2017, we and UCB announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the BLA for EVENITY  as a treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The resubmission will include data from the phase 3 ARCH study and select data from the phase 3 BRIDGE study evaluating EVENITY  in men with osteoporosis, in addition to the phase 3 FRAME study. We are currently evaluating all EVENITY  data and will be working in close collaboration with the FDA. In January 2018, we and UCB announced that the EMA accepted the MAA for EVENITY  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. IMLYGIC   IMLYGIC  is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from herpes simplex virus type 1. A phase 1b/3 study to evaluate IMLYGIC  in combination with Merck  Company, Inc.s (Mercks) anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA  (pembrolizumab), in patients with mid- to late-stage metastatic melanoma is ongoing. KYPROLIS   KYPROLIS  is a proteasome inhibitor. In July 2017, we announced positive results from the final analysis of the phase 3 ASPIRE study. The study met the key secondary endpoint of overall survival, demonstrating that KYPROLIS  , lenalidomide and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21% over lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. In December 2017, we submitted a sNDA to the FDA and a variation to the marketing authorization to the EMA to include the overall survival data from the ASPIRE study in the product label. In October 2017, we announced top-line results of the phase 3 ARROW study, which showed KYPROLIS  administered once-weekly at the 70 mg/m 2 dose with dexamethasone allowed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients to live 3.6 months longer without their disease worsening than KYPROLIS  administered twice-weekly at the 27 mg/m 2 dose with dexamethasone. The overall safety profile of the once-weekly KYPROLIS  regimen was comparable to that of the twice-weekly regimen. In January 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA has adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for KYPROLIS  to include updated overall survival data from the phase 3 head-to-head ENDEAVOR study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The ENDEAVOR study demonstrated that KYPROLIS  and dexamethasone reduced the risk of death by 21 percent, and increased overall survival by 7.6 months versus VELCADE  and dexamethasone.  A phase 3 study comparing carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab to carfilzomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is ongoing. Omecamtiv mecarbil Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small-molecule activator of cardiac myosin. It is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, Inc. and in collaboration with Servier for certain territories. A phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study for the treatment of chronic heart failure is ongoing. Prolia   Prolia  is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL. It is being investigated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. In October 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review the sBLA for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of May 28, 2018. Tezepelumab (formerly AMG 157) Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin. It is being evaluated as a treatment for asthma in an ongoing phase 3 study, as well as atopic dermatitis. Tezepelumab is being jointly developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca). AMG 301 AMG 301 is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type 1 (PAC1) receptor. It is being investigated for migraine prevention. AMG 301 is being jointly developed in collaboration with Novartis. AMG 520 / CNP520 AMG 520 / CNP520 is a small molecule inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE). It is being evaluated for the prevention of Alzheimers disease, with phase 3 studies ongoing. AMG 520 / CNP520 is being jointly developed in collaboration with Novartis. AMG 557 AMG 557 is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of the ICOS ligand. It is being investigated as a treatment for primary Sjgrens syndrome. AMG 557 is being jointly developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. AMG 714 AMG 714 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to Interleukin-15. It is being investigated for the treatment of celiac disease. In November 2017, Amgen reacquired the AMG 714 program from Celimmune LLC. Amgen Development of Biosimilars We continue to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines. Our biosimilar product candidates are in varying stages of commercialization and clinical development as described in the following table: ##TABLE_START Program  Reference product  Status AMJEVITA  / AMGEVITA   adalimumab (HUMIRA  )  Approved by FDA and EC across all eligible indications of reference product MVASI  *  bevacizumab (Avastin  )  Approved by FDA and EC across all eligible indications of reference product ABP 710  infliximab (REMICADE  )  Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis study ongoing ABP 798 *  rituximab (Rituxan  / Mabthera  )  Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis study ongoing Phase 3 non-Hodgkins lymphoma study ongoing ABP 959  eculizumab (Soliris  )  Phase 1 completed ABP 980 *  trastuzumab (Herceptin  )  BLA submitted to FDA; MAA submitted to EMA ##TABLE_END* Developed in collaboration with Allergan Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we also acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information. Kirin-Amgen, Inc. On October 30, 2017, we announced that we agreed to acquire the remaining 50% ownership interest of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A) from Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin). We completed the share acquisition during the first quarter of 2018, making K-A a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Prior to the closing of the share acquisition, K-A was a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin. K-A develops and then licenses all product rights which have been transferred from Amgen and Kirin. See Part IVNote 21, Subsequent event, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. K-A has given us exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, all Central American, South American, Middle Eastern and African countries and certain countries in Asia; (ii) darbepoetin alfa and romiplostim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market pegfilgrastim, G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. Under these agreements, Amgen pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Amgen also receives payments from K-A for milestones earned and for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. K-A has also given Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market: (i) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea; (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and in certain other countries and/or regions in Asia; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. K-A also gave Kirin and Amgen co-exclusive licenses to manufacture and market G-CSF, pegfilgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin in China, which Amgen subsequently assigned to Kirin, and as a result, Kirin now exclusively manufactures and markets G-CSF and recombinant human erythropoietin in China. Kirin markets G-CSF, pegfilgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim, recombinant human erythropoietin and brodalumab under the brand names GRAN  /Grasin  , Peglasta  /Neulasta  /G-Lasta  , NESP  /Aranesp  , ROMIPLATE  , ESPO  and LUMICEF  , respectively. Under these agreements, Kirin pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Kirin also receives payments from K-A for conducting certain RD activities on its behalf. K-A has also given JJ exclusive licenses to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin for all geographic areas of the world outside the United States, China and Japan. Under this agreement, JJ pays royalties to K-A based on product sales. See Part IVNote 8, Related party transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Novartis In April 2017, we expanded our existing migraine collaboration with Novartis. In the United States, Amgen and Novartis will jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig  . Amgen, as the principal, will recognize product sales of Aimovig  in the United States, will share U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and will pay Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig  and other specified migraine programs. Novartis will pay Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the products in the Novartis exclusive territories. Novartis will fund a portion of global RD expenses. Novartis will also make payments to Amgen that could collectively amount to approximately $400 million if certain regulatory events occur and commercial thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig  in the United States. Amgen will manufacture and supply Aimovig  worldwide. Pfizer Inc. The co-promotion term of our ENBREL collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in the United States and Canada expired on October 31, 2013. Under this agreement, we paid Pfizer a profit share until October 31, 2013, and residual royalties from November 1, 2013 to October 31, 2016, which were significantly less than the profit share payments. In 2015 and 2016, the residual royalty payments ranged from 11% to 10% of annual net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 1, 2016, there are no further royalty payments. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY  . In 2016, we amended the commercialization rights and responsibilities of the parties. Under the amended agreement, we have the rights to commercialize EVENITY  for all indications in the United States, Japan and Hong Kong. UCB has the rights for Europe, China and Brazil. The rest of the countries have been allocated to Amgen. Generally, development costs and future worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses are shared equally. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. We are in a collaboration with Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Bayer) to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar  (sorafenib). In 2015, we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Bayer, which terminated the co-promotion agreement in the United States, and transferred all U.S. operational responsibilities to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the termination of the co-promotion agreement, we co-promoted Nexavar  with Bayer and shared equally in the profits in the United States. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on U.S. sales of Nexavar  at a percentage rate in the high 30s. Outside of the United States, excluding Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures and mutually agreed RD expenses, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside of the United States, except Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer. DaVita Inc. In January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), which superseded the previously existing seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Such percentage varies during the term of the agreement, but in each year is at least 90%. The agreement expires in 2022. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party.

Information related to the operation of the SECs public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 800-SEC-0330. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. The statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers. Intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs continues and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal and state governments. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative and/or administrative actions. Discussions continue around a number of potential legislative changes that could affect the reimbursement and/or pricing of our products, including proposals to allow the U.S. federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and to require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting. Legislation has been introduced into the U.S. Congress for other proposals, including legislation designed to overhaul provisions of the ACA as well as to enable commercial-level re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries. State government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced. Some states have adopted, and many other states have discussed and debated and are considering, new pricing legislation, including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products. For example, in October 2017, Californias governor signed into law a new drug pricing transparency bill that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Existing and proposed pricing legislation could lead to the introduction and passage of additional bills or ballot initiatives in other states. While we are unable to predict if additional changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that these or other changes affect how our products are priced, paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers in the United States our business could be adversely impacted. Changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. Further, CMS is undertaking other projects to test care models, such as the CMS Oncology Care Model that provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively impacting the efficacy of care. We believe the Oncology Care Model has impacted utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. In addition, the timing of reimbursement policy decisions can affect our business. Legislative or regulatory changes in the United States or other federal or state government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products or reduce the use of our U.S. products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. Many payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs.) Payers also increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as by requiring prior authorizations or step therapy, and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some providers do not complete the burdensome administrative process required to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed meet the payers utilization management criteria and, as a result, patients do not gain access to Repatha  treatment. Further, other patients may obtain coverage for Repatha  but abandon their prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated delivery systems, would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. For example, international reference pricing (IRP) is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. In the United States, pricing data that we submit to the U.S. government impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare, Medicaid and other government drug programs. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable data exclusivity period would accelerate such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate. In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated and authorized pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries have adopted and others are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products, and other countries may adopt similar measures. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. In the United States, the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Sandozs Zarxio  , is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  , and was launched in the United States in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including a biosimilar version of ENBREL. In addition, a growing number of companies have announced that they are in varying stages of development of biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including biosimilars that would compete with our products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For information related to our biosimilars patent litigation, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products or could encourage prescribers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity, which could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, public, legislative, and FDA efforts to promote price competition through easier generic entry. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, including the requirement to provide 180 days notice in advance of commercial marketing. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products. While we may attempt to challenge such patents, our efforts may be unsuccessful. For information related to our patent litigation with manufacturers of proposed generic and biosimilar versions of our products, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the existing patents on our products have recently expired. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies, and a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical products. These assessments may come from private organizations, such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers. In addition, government HTA organizations, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such HTA organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies, or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.  Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets.  We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by progression-free survival (PFS). Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, or the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDL-C levels. However, the FDA initially approved Repatha  in 2015 only for a subset of those patients, citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events. In December 2017, the FDA granted broader approval of Repatha  to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint. See Item 1. BusinessSignificant Developments. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels. Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, BLINCYTO  received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL from the EC in November 2015, with full authorization conditioned on demonstrating clinical effectiveness and safety in clinical practice and in a subsequent clinical trial. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirements on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products. Similarly, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationPost-approval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks, and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: ##TABLE_START  revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. ##TABLE_END For example, since 2006, when adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed, ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. Reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of ESAs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, changes to ESA labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, questions remain as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products and what information can be included in biosimilar labeling. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure first-to-market positions, our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD. Amgen invests heavily in RD. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined. ##TABLE_ENDA number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in May 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In such diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta  is available as part of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit, and we recently launched the AutoTouch  reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini  single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our product candidates may also be used in combination with a companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events, and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and impacts to our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017 the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products.  The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax. Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised their calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. We incurred a net estimated tax expense of $6.1 billion due to the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. In computing our expense, we are allowed under new SEC accounting guidance to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We consider a number of key estimates we have made with respect to the 2017 Tax Act to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Our continuing analysis (which will include evaluation of future U.S. Treasury regulations, accounting interpretations or other developments relating to the 2017 Tax Act) could affect the measurement of these balances and give rise to new deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsIncome taxes. We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales . In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane destroyed residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, communications networks and most of Puerto Ricos electric grid. The critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm, and we have now resumed our full manufacturing operations. The restoration of electrical service on the island has been a slow process. As a result, our facility operated with electrical power from back-up diesel-powered generators through the end of 2017 and we received regular deliveries of diesel fuel under pre-arranged contracts. In January 2018, we reconnected to the Puerto Rico electric grid and began operating without the back-up generators. However, power has not been restored to the entire island, and it is possible that the electric grid may not remain stable and we may be required to resume use of our diesel generators. In addition, supplies of medical-grade oxygen and nitrogen used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing operations are limited on the island, and we have arranged deliveries of both gases from the U.S. mainland and other countries. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales . While nearly all of our staff have returned to work, some of them or their families may now or in the future be without housing, access to food and clean water, electricity, healthcare, sanitation, communications services, childcare, transportation or other essentials, and for these or other reasons some of our staff may be forced or elect to temporarily or permanently relocate elsewhere on or off the island. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility (whether due to problems with the facility itself, the infrastructure and services available on the island, the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors, the unavailability of key staff or otherwise) or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales . The impact of Hurricane Maria is certain to place greater stress on the islands already challenged economy. Since June 2015, when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government (including certain government entities) was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt, the governments liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt, achieve fiscal responsibility and gain access to capital markets. PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring. In May 2017, after negotiations with creditors were unsuccessful and an automatic stay of creditor actions expired, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico, following thereafter with similar filings for certain Puerto Rico government entities. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Given the severe conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, it is expected that resolution of Puerto Ricos outstanding debt situation through the PROMESA judicial process will be delayed pending recovery efforts. Additionally, in January 2017, the Puerto Rico government enacted the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which, among other things, declared a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico and authorized the Governor to designate certain services as essential services, and other services as non-essential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Ricos obligations. The Puerto Rico government has continued to extend the emergency period. In June 2017, the Oversight Board certified the Puerto Rico governments budget for fiscal year 2018. In January 2018, the Puerto Rico government proposed a revised fiscal plan. The revised fiscal plan is subject to approval by the Oversight Board and calls for delayed and reduced payments to creditors and assumes U.S. federal disaster assistance of $35 billion. The Puerto Rico government is continuing to seek assistance from the U.S. government for disaster relief related to Hurricane Maria. In October 2017, the U.S. Congress approved a supplemental appropriation for disaster relief whereby Puerto Rico could receive a loan of up to approximately $5 billion to be used by the Puerto Rico government to provide essential services. U.S. and Puerto Rico officials are currently negotiating the terms and conditions of disaster relief loans that may be granted to Puerto Rico. In November 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico submitted an additional request for federal disaster assistance to restore housing and rebuild a resilient power grid. It is not certain whether and what amounts will be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to assist in the hurricane recovery. In addition, the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation will no longer permit deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings of U.S. companies (or their foreign subsidiaries), although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced 10.5% rate. Given Puerto Ricos challenged economy and hurricane recovery needs, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base due to competition from other foreign locations subject to a similar level of U.S. taxation, or U.S. locations due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The manufacturing sector currently contributes more than 45% of Puerto Ricos gross domestic product, and U.S. companies with Puerto Rico operations contribute more than 33% of Puerto Ricos revenue base. While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Ricos ongoing economic challenges, the effects of Hurricane Maria and the potential impact of the 2017 Tax Act could negatively affect the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, and/or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Insulet Corporation is our single source of the on-body injector for our Neulasta  Onpro   kit. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters. ##TABLE_END For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product use and sales and our business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. BusinessManufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START  capacity of manufacturing facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in forecasts of future demand; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  updates of manufacturing specifications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and outcome of product quality testing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  power failures and/or other utility failures; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment. ##TABLE_END If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. We are in the process of commercially validating and licensing a second facility at our site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS  . If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for this facility on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN  sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability . The concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively impacting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, it could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal RD and external transactions including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (acquisition activity). We have an ongoing process of evaluating such potential acquisition activity opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions or similar arrangements may be complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications . Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. These legal and operational challenges along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales, business and results of operations. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. As we announced on December 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. In connection with that settlement, we have been operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until December 2017. The corporate integrity agreement also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance program. Certain of the corporate integrity agreements reporting obligations to OIG continue into 2018. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. To achieve our business objectives, we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or affect our reputation. Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our RD efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of key loggers or other harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, and can be deployed through malicious websites, the use of social engineering and/or other means. Attacks such as those recently seen with other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and distributing our products. For example, in 2017, Merck experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other business partners. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) by employees, service providers, nation states, organized crime organizations, hacktivists or others, pose risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. Finally, domestic and global government regulators, our key business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with important business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers. Although in the past we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection, and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or impact our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability . As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially impacted. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Overview Amgen is a highly focused biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the worlds leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal products (those products with the most significant annual commercial sales) include ENBREL, Neulasta  , Aranesp  , Prolia  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  , XGEVA  and EPOGEN  . We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS  , Vectibix  , Nplate  , NEUPOGEN  , Repatha  , BLINCYTO  , IMLYGIC  , Corlanor  and Parsabiv  . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Six therapeutic areas form the core of our businessoncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Our strategy to execute in these therapeutic areas is multifaceted as we engage in a series of integrated activities to strengthen our competitive position in the industry focused on seven strategic priorities: In 2017, we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities. ##TABLE_START  Our innovative pipeline continued to advance with the addition of cardiovascular outcomes data to the Repatha  label in the United States. The FDA also approved Parsabiv  for secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and Vectibix  , in combination with chemotherapy, for use in wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, and expanded the BLINCYTO  indication to include the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children. We submitted the U.S. regulatory filing for Aimovig  for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraines per month. We also made U.S. and EU regulatory filings to include overall survival data in the KYPROLIS  label for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients and to expand the XGEVA  indication to include the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. We announced positive phase 3 results for a weekly regimen of KYPROLIS  for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and positive phase 2b results with tezepelumab, which has now advanced into Phase 3 for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma. Throughout the course of the year, we invested in external early-stage innovation to augment our internal research efforts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our biosimilars also continued to advance as the FDA approved MVASI  for the treatment of five types of cancer, and the EC approved AMGEVITA  for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. We also gained clarity on the launch timing of AMGEVITA  , which is now expected in Europe later this year and we submitted U.S. and EU regulatory filings for ABP 980. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We continued to build the foundation for long-term growth through our product launches in new parts of the world, as seen by our ability to secure 80 country product launches, leveraging our global presence to deliver the potential of our products to patients. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world while responding to natural disasters and investing for the future. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island, however, the critical manufacturing areas of our site in Juncos were not significantly impacted and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that build on our expertise in human biology and protein manufacturing. This next-generation biomanufacturing dramatically reduces the scale and costs of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. In 2017, our new Singapore facility that uses our next-generation biomanufacturing technology was approved for certain commercial production by multiple regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the EMA. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We continued to innovate with delivery systems to differentiate our products, as seen by our development of the AutoTouch  reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini  single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL), which was approved by the FDA in September 2017. This device was ergonomically designed to meet the needs of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We also launched our Repatha  automated mini-doser with pre-filled cartridge in Europe. This hands-free device provides Repatha  in a single injection for administration monthly. Further, the use of the Neulasta  Onpro  On-body Injector continues to increase, exiting 2017 with over 60% share of Neulasta  sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash flows from operating activities grew 8% to $ 11.2 billion, enabling us to invest for the future and return capital to shareholders, consistent with our expectations for long-term growth. We increased our dividend 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We also repurchased 18.5 million shares of our common stock throughout 2017 at an aggregate cost of $3.1 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We further optimized our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts. Our transformation has established a foundation for growth and we are approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence. ##TABLE_END Our 2017 financial results also reflect the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which unlocks additional financial flexibility. While 2017 execution was strong, we expect 2018 will be another important year as we continue to invest in the pipeline, build our global business and support new product growth. In preparation for 2018, we expanded our transformation activities and savings initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products will face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents and see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected Financial Information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 Product sales:      U.S. $ 17,131  (1 )%  $ 17,325 Rest of world (ROW) 4,664  %  4,567 Total product sales 21,795   %  21,892 Other revenues 1,054  (4 )%  1,099 Total revenues $ 22,849  (1 )%  $ 22,991 Operating expenses $ 12,876  (2 )%  $ 13,197 Operating income $ 9,973  %  $ 9,794 Net income $ 1,979  (74 )%  $ 7,722 Diluted EPS $ 2.69  (74 )%  $ 10.24 Diluted shares  (3 )%  ##TABLE_ENDIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Total product sales for 2017 decreased slightly as a decline in U.S. product sales was offset partially by an increase in ROW product sales. The U.S. decrease was driven primarily by lower unit demand resulting from competition, offset partially by increases in net selling prices and favorable changes in inventory. The increase in ROW product sales for 2017 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and declines in net selling prices. Operating expenses for 2017 decreased 2%. All expense categories benefited from savings resulting from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 ENBREL $ 5,433  (9 )%  $ 5,965  %  $ 5,364 Neulasta  4,534  (2 )%  4,648  (1 )%  4,715 Aranesp  2,053  (2 )%  2,093  %  1,951 Prolia  1,968  %  1,635  %  1,312 Sensipar  /Mimpara  1,718  %  1,582  %  1,415 XGEVA  1,575  %  1,529  %  1,405 EPOGEN  1,096  (15 )%  1,282  (31 )%  1,856 Other products 3,418  %  3,158  %  2,926 Total product sales $ 21,795   %  $ 21,892  %  $ 20,944 Total U.S. $ 17,131  (1 )%  $ 17,325  %  $ 16,523 Total ROW 4,664  %  4,567  %  4,421 Total product sales $ 21,795   %  $ 21,892  %  $ 20,944 ##TABLE_ENDFuture sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 ENBREL  U.S. $ 5,206  (9 )%  $ 5,719  %  $ 5,099 ENBREL  Canada  (8 )%   (7 )%  Total ENBREL $ 5,433  (9 )% $ 5,965  %  $ 5,364 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price, offset partially by an increase in inventory. For 2018, we expect the trends of lower unit demand and net selling price to continue. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price, offset partially by the impact of competition. Neulasta   Total Neulasta  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,931   %  $ 3,925  %  $ 3,891 Neulasta   ROW  (17 )%   (12 )%  Total Neulasta  $ 4,534  (2 )% $ 4,648  (1 )%  $ 4,715 ##TABLE_ENDThe decreases in global Neulasta  sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. As of the end of December 2017 , utilization of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit continues to grow in the United States. Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta  expired in October 2015. Therefore, we expect to face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta  . Multiple companies have announced applications to the FDA for proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta  . While a number of these companies have announced receipt of Complete Response Letters from the FDA regarding their applications, certain of these companies may receive approval in 2018. For discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta  , see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, relating to our European patent for Neulasta  expired in August 2017. For further information regarding our patents, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents. Neulasta  sales have been and will continue to be impacted by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 Aranesp   U.S. $ 1,114  %  $ 1,082  %  $ Aranesp   ROW  (7 )%  1,011  (4 )%  1,051 Total Aranesp  $ 2,053  (2 )% $ 2,093  %  $ 1,951 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in global Aranesp  sales for 2017 was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN  . The increase in global Aranesp  sales for 2016  was driven primarily by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN  , offset partially by  a decrease in net selling price in ROW. For 2018, we expect Aranesp  to face increasing competition from branded products. We could also face competition from biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  in 2018 if they launch in the United States. Prolia   Total Prolia  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 Prolia   U.S. $ 1,272  %  $ 1,049  %  $ Prolia   ROW  %   %  Total Prolia  $ 1,968  % $ 1,635  %  $ 1,312 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global Prolia  sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.

Our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to Sensipar  , a small molecule, expires in March 2018. We are also involved in a number of litigation matters relating to Sensipar  , including patent litigations with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar  and litigation regarding our request for pediatric exclusivity for Sensipar  . See Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. XGEVA   Total XGEVA  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016  Change  Year ended December 31, 2015 XGEVA   U.S. $ 1,157  %  $ 1,115  %  $ 1,006 XGEVA   ROW  %   %  Total XGEVA  $ 1,575  % $ 1,529  %  $ 1,405 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global XGEVA  sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.

BusinessBusiness Relationships) and, to a lesser extent, a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to A ranesp  . The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2016 was driven by a decline in unit demand resulting from competition and a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to A ranesp  . Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN  expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN  . Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  and certain of these companies may receive approval in 2018. For discussion of ongoing patent litigation with this company, see Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The transformation includes a restructuring plan that we continue to estimate will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $825 million to $900 million . As of December 31, 2017 , restructuring costs incurred to date were $797 million. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we incurred restructuring costs of $88 million, $37 million and $114 million, respectively. We expect that we will incur most of the remaining estimated costs in 2018 in order to support our ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.5 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IVNote 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Puerto Rico operations In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the island and some damage to our facility in Juncos. Critical manufacturing areas of our facility were not significantly affected, and we have resumed our full manufacturing operations. Further recovery efforts on the island are ongoing. We have continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. We incurred $146 million of pre-tax expenses in 2017 related to Hurricane Maria. At this time, we do not expect significant pre-tax expenses in 2018. Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 17.8% of total revenues for 2017 , driven primarily by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower royalties and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. Cost of sales decreased to 18.1% of total revenues for 2016 , driven primarily by certain manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Companys RD activities as set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START Category  Description DRTS  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later-stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    DRTS $  $ 1,039  $ Later-stage clinical programs  1,054  1,876 Marketed products 1,711  1,747  1,197 Total RD expense $ 3,562  $ 3,840  $ 4,070 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in RD expenses for 2017 was driven by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical program support, lower external business development expense in DRTS and lower marketed-product support. All categories of RD spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts and we continue to advance our pipeline. The decrease in RD expenses for 2016 was driven primarily by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical programs support of $822 million, offset partially by increased costs associated with marketed-products support of $550 million. All categories of RD spend benefited from savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. The decrease was offset partially by reinvestment for the long-term benefit of the company, including an increase in DRTS for up-front milestone payments related to several collaboration transactions. Prior to approval, costs related to our launch products were categorized largely as later-stage clinical programs. Selling, general and administrative The decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense for 2017 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launch and marketed product support. The increase in SGA expense for 2016 was driven primarily by further investments in product launches, offset partially by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 11% in 2016 and 2015. Other Other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899 and $83 million of certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. See Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2015 included $91 million of charges related to legal proceedings; certain charges related to our restructuring initiatives, including separation costs of $49 million; $31 million of write-offs of non-key assets acquired in a prior-year business combination; and $111 million of gains from the sale of assets related to our site closures. Non-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses, income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Interest expense, net $ 1,304  $ 1,260  $ 1,095 Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provision for income taxes $ 7,618  $ 1,441  $ 1,039 Effective tax rate 79.4 %  15.7 %  13.0 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The increases in interest expense, net in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the respective prior year. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances and higher gains on strategic investments. The increase in interest and other income, net for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances in 2016 , offset partially by higher gains on strategic equity investments in 2015 . Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 compared with 2016 was due primarily to impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, offset partially by the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, offset partially by the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation payments. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act that imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, implements a territorial tax system together with a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) that allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We currently are analyzing the 2017 Tax Act, and in certain areas, have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our consolidated financial statements and tax disclosures, including the amount of the repatriation tax and changes to our existing deferred tax balances. The repatriation tax is based primarily on our accumulated foreign earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We recorded an estimated amount for our repatriation tax liability of $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. We no longer reinvest our undistributed earnings of our foreign operations indefinitely outside the United States. In addition, we remeasured certain net deferred and other tax liabilities based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The estimated amount recorded related to the remeasurement of these balances was a net benefit of $1.2 billion. The net estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act is $6.1 billion. We consider the key estimates on the repatriation tax, net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits to be incomplete due to our continuing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Our analysis could affect the measurement of these balances and give rise to new deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since the 2017 Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and further guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, our review is still pending. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period. As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. On November 29, 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised their calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution through the IRS administrative appeals process, which we believe will likely not be concluded within the next 12 months. Final resolution of the IRS audit could have a material impact on our results of consolidated operations and cash flows if not resolved favorably, however, we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. See Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesIncome taxes, and Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  December 31,   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 41,678  $ 38,085 Total assets $ 79,954  $ 77,626 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 1,152  $ 4,403 Long-term debt $ 34,190  $ 30,193 Stockholders equity $ 25,241  $ 29,875 ##TABLE_ENDCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. Under the 2017 Tax Act, we owe a repatriation tax on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion that will be paid over eight years. See Contractual Obligations below. We will also have access to global cash generated from operations in the future. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Capital allocation Consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we will seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner and will consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. In addition to deploying our cash balances, we intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015 , increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016 , and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in 2017 . In December 2017 , the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2017 , we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion . In 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , $4.4 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion under our stock repurchase program. Based on our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business, enhanced by the 2017 Tax Act, and consistent with our ongoing objective to return capital to our stockholders, on February 5, 2018, we announced a tender offer to purchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock at a price not greater than $200 per share nor less than $175 per share. The tender offer expires at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of Monday, March 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business . Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 , were $ 1.2 billion and $ 34.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016 , were $ 4.4 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , Standard  Poors Financial Services LLC (SP), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.5 billion , respectively. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we repaid debt of $4.4 billion , $3.7 billion and $2.4 billion , respectively. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.45 billion and $6.65 billion, respectively. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion . As of December 31, 2017 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017 , we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2016 and 2015 , we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2020. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this arrangement as of December 31, 2017 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,177  $ 10,354  $ 9,731 Net cash used in investing activities $ (4,024 )  $ (8,658 )  $ (5,547 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (6,594 )  $ (2,599 )  $ (3,771 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 due primarily to a higher operating margin and the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 due primarily to an improved operating margin and the timing of customer payments, offset partially by inventory build, the monetization of foreign currency forward contracts in 2015 and the timing of tax payments. Investing Cash used in investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion , $7.7 billion and $4.4 billion , respectively. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks campus, as well as manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, were $664 million , $738 million and $594 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. We currently estimate 2018 spending on capital projects to be approximately $750 million. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $4.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $191 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $4.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $3.7 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7.3 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of debt of $2.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $2.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $1.9 billion , withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $401 million and the settlement of contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a business of $253 million , offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3.5 billion . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period as of December 31, 2017 Contractual obligations  Total  Year 1  Years 2 and 3  Years 4 and 5  Years 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)  $ 56,763  $ 2,530  $ 9,964  $ 9,705  $ 34,564 Operating lease obligations (5)      Purchase obligations (6)  1,343     U.S. repatriation tax (7)  7,316   1,170  1,170  4,391 Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (8)           Total contractual obligations  $ 66,072  $ 3,878  $ 11,722  $ 11,184  $ 39,288 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $22 million. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2017 , in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IVNote 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2017 . See Part IVNote 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Operating lease obligations exclude $205 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Under the 2017 Tax Act, we will elect to pay the repatriation tax primarily related to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations in eight annual installments beginning April 2018. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.0 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IVNote 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of December 31, 2014 $ 1,120  $  $  $ 1,379 Amounts charged against product sales 2,734  4,275   7,741 Payments (2,735 )  (4,198 )  (701 )  (7,634 ) Balance as of December 31, 2015 1,119    1,486 Amounts charged against product sales 3,479  5,270   9,654 Payments (3,181 )  (5,201 )  (884 )  (9,266 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 1,417    1,874 Amounts charged against product sales 4,909  6,098   11,999 Payments (4,459 )  (6,168 )  (999 )  (11,626 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 1,867  $  $  $ 2,247 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , total sales deductions were 35%, 31% and 27% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 to address the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act are recognized upon enactment, however, SAB 118 permits a company to recognize provisional amounts when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. The measurement period to finalize our calculations cannot extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Key provisions that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and where we have recognized estimated amounts include the recognition of liabilities for taxes on repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. Furthermore, the 2017 Tax Act permits a company, upon election, to pay the repatriation tax over eight years on an interest-free basis, which we expect to do. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board staff issued Staff QA, Topic 740, No. 2, Whether to Discount the Tax Liability on Deemed Repatriation, which notes that the repatriation tax liability should not be discounted. See Part IVNote 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability . Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IVNote 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. See Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently reduced the related contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IVNote 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during 2017, we discontinued the internal development of AMG 899 and consequently recorded an IPRD asset impairment charge. See Part IVNote 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Interest rate sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , was composed of: U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities; corporate debt securities; residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities; money market mutual funds; and other short-term interest-bearing securities, composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $41.2 billion and $37.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these securities of $1.1 billion and $900 million, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $35.3 billion and a fair value of $38.6 billion . As of December 31, 2016 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $34.6 billion and a fair value of $36.5 billion . Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates with variable rate debt having a carrying value of $850 million and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , would have resulted in an increase of $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. The analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts which qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges, for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.45 billion and $6.65 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , would have resulted in reductions in fair values of $420 million and $240 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that hedge certain of our foreign-currency denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of $390 million and $450 million, respectively. Foreign currency sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , we had outstanding euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.3 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2016 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.2 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt. We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with an aggregate notional amount of $5.6 billion , as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates, would have resulted in a reduction in the fair values of these contracts of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact on income in the ensuing years from these contracts of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2017 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $4.6 billion and $74 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts, primarily euro-based, with notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $608 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair values of these contracts were a $200 million liability and a $200 million asset, respectively. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $360 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2016 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $650 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $300 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $757 million and $666 million , respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market price sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by SP, Moodys or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2017 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Amgen Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Amgen Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 13, 2018  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 150% of the performance units granted in 2015 and 200% of performance units granted in 2016 and 2017. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2017 , the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes: (i) 3,963,390 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $127.10; (ii) 3,664,499 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 177,631 related dividend equivalents); and (iii)  2,214,310 shares subject to outstanding 2015, 2016 and 2017 performance units (including 99,373 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2017 , employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 150% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2015 and 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2016 and 2017. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants.

The results confirmed noninferiority compared to infliximab but could not rule out superiority based on its primary efficacy endpoint. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In December 2018 and January 2019, we submitted a BLA to the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA, respectively, for ABP 710. ##TABLE_END ABP 798 (biosimilar rituximab) ##TABLE_START  In January 2019, we and Allergan announced positive top-line results from a phase 1/phase 3 study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ABP 798, a biosimilar candidate to RITUXAN  (rituximab), compared to rituximab in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The results demonstrate that the study met its primary endpoint of pharmacokinetic similarity. Additionally, equivalent efficacy was established and a similar safety profile was demonstrated. ##TABLE_END Next-generation biomanufacturing ##TABLE_START  In April 2018, we announced plans to build a new next-generation biomanufacturing plant on our campus in West Greenwich, Rhode Island. The new plant will employ our next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities and manufacture products for the U.S. and global markets. ##TABLE_END * FDA provisionally approved trade name. Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by partnering with third parties. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third partys varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels including, print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 98% , 96% and 96% of our U.S. gross product sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and 84% , 81% and 81% of worldwide gross revenues for each of these years. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance. Our products are marketed around the world, with the United States being our largest market. The following chart shows our product sales by principal product and by geography for the years ended 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Enbrel  (etanercept) We market ENBREL primarily in the United States. It was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with the following conditions: ##TABLE_START  moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  active psoriatic arthritis. ##TABLE_END Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim) We market Neulasta  , a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta  was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count, in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta  Onpro  kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta  Onpro  kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of Neulasta  on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta  at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. Prolia  (denosumab) We market Prolia  primarily in the United States and Europe. Prolia  contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA  (denosumab)  but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia  was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia  is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) We market Aranesp  primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) (in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis). Aranesp  is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp  . Aranesp  and EPOGEN  (epoetin alfa) compete with each other in the United States, primarily in the dialysis setting. XGEVA   We market XGEVA  primarily in the United States and Europe. XGEVA  was launched in the United States in 2010 and is now used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma. XGEVA  was launched in Europe in 2011 and is used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. It was approved in January 2018 in the United States and April 2018 in Europe for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. Sensipar  /Mimpara  (cinacalcet) We market cinacalcet as Sensipar  primarily in the United States and as Mimpara  primarily in Europe. It was launched in 2004 and is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with CKD who are on dialysis. Sensipar  and our recently launched Parsabiv  (etelcalcetide) compete with each other. EPOGEN   We market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. EPOGEN  was launched in 1989, and we market it for the indication to treat anemia caused by CKD in patients on dialysis in order to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. The majority of our sales are to a large dialysis provider. Other Marketed Products We also market a number of other products in various markets worldwide, including KYPROLIS  (carfilzomib), Nplate  (romiplostim), Vectibix  (panitumumab), Repatha  (evolocumab), NEUPOGEN  (filgrastim), Parsabiv  , BLINCYTO  (blinatumomab), Aimovig  (erenumab-aooe), IMLYGIC  (talimogene laherparepvec), Corlanor  (ivabradine), KANJINTI TM (biosimilar trastuzumab) and AMGEVITA TM (biosimilar adalimumab).

A number of our marketed products are indicated in disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development (RD) activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are being pursued currently. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways to increase the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, in 2015, we launched the Neulasta  Onpro  kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta  on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. We also launched in 2017 the AutoTouch  reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini  single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL). The Enbrel Mini  utilizes a new drug formulation of ENBREL that was associated with statistically significant lower mean injection site pain than the current formulation. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product. We expect that the adverse impact on our product sales from biosimilar competition will be more like branded biologic competition than that seen when branded small molecules face generics, but we believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our products get approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, resulting in a greater impact on our products sales. Although we expect biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. In the United States, companies now have approved biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  and ENBREL. See also Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars. As biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage both the experience we have had in the United States versus branded competition and our experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe. In addition, although most of our products are biologics, some of our products are small-molecule products. Because the FDA approval process allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often market their competing versions of our small-molecule products at much lower prices. As a result, upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a small-molecule product, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents, or in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future .

In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare, and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs, and in particular specialty drugs such as our products, remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and scrutinizing the prices of these products, while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system.  These pressures are intensified where our products are subject to increasing competition. In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. We are required to provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and also provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. In addition, we provide rebates to PBMs, as well as other entities (such as hospitals and pharmacies), which are payments by a biopharmaceutical manufacturer of a portion of the products purchase price back to the PBMs or other entities. Biopharmaceutical-product pricing remains central to discussions on controlling healthcare costs in the United States. Policy makers from both of the major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs for patients. In May 2018, U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration released a drug-pricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the federal governments negotiating power, reduce drug prices and lower patients out-of-pocket costs. The blueprint included a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, the biopharmaceutical industry; and the U.S. presidential administration has already begun to implement certain elements described in the administrations drug-pricing blueprint, such as (i) seeking initial feedback on a potential program that would set the Medicare payment amount for Part B single-source drugs and biologics to be more closely aligned with international drug prices and rely on third-party vendors, (ii) issuing guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to begin requiring that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy, (iii) lowering initial reimbursement rates for new Part B drugs launched beginning in 2019 and (iv) proposing new rules to require drug price information in direct-to-consumer drug television advertising. The blueprint also discussed (i) the potential removal of the safe-harbor protection under the federal anti-kickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers and (ii) changes to the Part D program. At the same time, value assessments of new technologies previously used predominantly outside the United States are having an impact in the U.S. healthcare environment. Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing. Although these organizations do not set drug prices, they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments, often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product. In addition, continued consolidation of payers and integration of providers and payers (integrated delivery systems) increase the level of market power held by our customers. Such developments, particularly when taken in combination with increasing product competition, put greater pressure on access to, pricing of and sales of our products. In addition, rebates and/or discount levels as well as the number of entities that are entitled to receive them since they are reimbursed through government programs have increased over time. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act, enacted in 2018, requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to pay greater discounts for patients in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2019; and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us. The ACA also imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) signed by President Trump in December 2017, Congress removed a key ACA provision by repealing the individual mandate penalty, which required every person to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Future changes to government programs such as the ACA, whether legislative or regulatory, could impact the number of patient lives covered, could raise or lower the cost or quality of insurance, could affect Medicaid eligibility and could change levels of patient protections provided unless alternatives are put in place. Other government legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, including for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD); changes in the federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for drug payment in Medicare or Medicaid; and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars, such as policies that would facilitate easier substitution for, or provide reimbursement advantages over, the corresponding innovative products. In ESRD, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a bundled-payment system and recently finalized changes allowing more new dialysis drugs to be eligible for temporary add-on payment adjustments starting in 2020. Sensipar  and Parsabiv  were already eligible for add-on payment adjustments beginning in 2018 and will continue to receive them in 2019. CMS has indicated interest in testing new models for drug payment in Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS also continues to test alternative payment models with providers, such as the Oncology Care Model. These models provide financial incentives for providers who participate; under the models, providers take on greater risk for the overall cost and quality of care. In addition, in 2018 CMS implemented changes to Medicare payment to hospitals for Part B drugs acquired through the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program but provided a financial incentive for hospitals to use biosimilar products over the corresponding innovative products. As described above, CMS is permitting Medicare Advantage plans to implement access controls for Part B drugs while also (i) considering a proposal that would set the Medicare payment amount for Part B single-source drugs and biologics to more closely align with international drug prices and rely on third-party vendors and (ii) considering changes to Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. These and/or other changes have the potential to impact prescribing and patient access to Amgens therapies. Additional efforts by state legislatures and government agencies in the United States could also affect us and our industry. For example, a California law requires manufacturers to provide payers advance notice of a price increase over a specified threshold, and laws in Oregon and Vermont require manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to a state attorney agency if certain price increase and state-spending thresholds are met. Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers. In the U.S. private sector, payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, and/or higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers that handle the majority of sales for ENBREL and Repatha  has continued to intensify and thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. Our past experience with Repatha  underscores that utilization management requirements, including the burdensome administrative processes required of physicians to demonstrate and document that patients meet such requirements, continue to be a significant challenge for patients and physicians, limiting access for appropriate usage. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. A drugs inclusion and favorable positioning on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions due to economic reasons. In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL, Repatha  and Aimovig  , PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position. In many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints, and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls; price referencing; therapeutic-reference pricing; increases in mandates; incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage; and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies, and these organizations are expanding in established and emerging markets. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by: ##TABLE_START  investing billions of dollars annually in RD; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably-supplied biosimilars; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  providing patient support and education programs and helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers. ##TABLE_ENDSee Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small-molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in manufacturing of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. Our internal manufacturing network has the commercial production capabilities of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network. To support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California and, to a lesser extent, our Rhode Island facilities. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers for certain clinical products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations also includes key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards. Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. In 2017, our next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Singapore was licensed by the FDA and the EMA for certain commercial-scale production. In 2018, we successfully completed additional bulk process qualification campaigns, which if approved, would permit the commercial production of an additional product at that site. A next-generation biomanufacturing plant incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and therefore can be built in half the construction time with approximately one-half of the operating cost of a traditional plant. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within the plant, the equipment is portable and smaller, and some components are disposable, which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously. This eliminates costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and allows Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility, ultimately impacting the speed at which a medicine is available for patients. The Singapore site also has a plant with the capability to produce small-molecule drugs. When approved by relevant regulatory authorities this plant can be used for commercial manufacturing. In July 2018, we announced the groundbreaking of our new next-generation biomanufacturing plant that will be constructed at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus. The new plant is expected to be the first of its kind in the United States and will use our next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities. After construction has been completed and upon approval by the FDA and other global regulatory authorities, this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to help authenticate the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products. Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products, as well as the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. ##TABLE_START  In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. ##TABLE_END The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small-molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application. Approval of Biosimilars .  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, as risk-benefit has previously been established. In order to preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, some of which remain in draft form. As of the end of 2018, 16 biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA, including our products AMJEVITA TM , a biosimilar candidate to HUMIRA  (adalimumab), and MVASI TM , a biosimilar candidate to Avastin  (bevacizumab),  as well as competitors to our products ENBREL, Aranesp  , EPOGEN  , NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . A number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway, some of which are for biosimilars of our products. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion . The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDAs implementing regulations and guidance. The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. health care fraud and abuse laws. Regulation of Manufacturing Standards . The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. Regulation of Combination Products . Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation outside the United States In the European Union (EU) countries as well as Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure , identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessmentbased on safety, quality and efficacyis reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure , which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMAs CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. As a result of the United Kingdoms vote to leave the EU in March 2019, the EMA announced that it will relocate its headquarters from London to Amsterdam by March 30, 2019. While negotiations continue regarding the terms of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the EU, the specific impact to the supervision, regulation and supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe remain unclear. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., South Korea, India, Australia, Singapore and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea). In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby the manufacturer must establish that its medical device conforms to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements. Post-approval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine post-marketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and we currently have REMS for Prolia  , Nplate  and BLINCYTO  . Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false-claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false-claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. In 2012, Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which was formally closed out in August 2018. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strength in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modality-independent approach to RD. We use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. Leveraging two decades of research at deCODE, a global leader in analyzing the human genome, we are reshaping our portfolio and increasingly focusing efforts on validated targets. Human genetic validation is used whenever possible in order to enhance the likelihood of success. For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , our RD expenses were $3.7 billion , $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. We have major RD centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD. The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 12, 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication. We may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons, including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with regard to the use of our products. In addition, the table does not include biosimilar products we are developing, which are discussed later in this section. ##TABLE_START Molecule  Disease/condition Phase 3 Programs   ENBREL  Rheumatoid arthritis remission EVENITY TM  Postmenopausal osteoporosis; Male osteoporosis IMLYGIC   Metastatic melanoma KYPROLIS   Multiple myeloma Omecamtiv mecarbil  Chronic heart failure Tezepelumab  Severe asthma AMG 520 / CNP520  Alzheimers disease Phase 2 Programs   BLINCYTO   Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Tezepelumab  Atopic dermatitis AMG 714 / PRV-015  Celiac disease Phase 1 Programs   IMLYGIC   Various cancer types AMG 119  Small-cell lung cancer AMG 160  Prostate cancer AMG 176  Hematologic malignancies AMG 212  Prostate cancer AMG 330  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 397  Hematologic malignancies AMG 420  Multiple myeloma AMG 424  Multiple myeloma AMG 427  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 510  Solid tumors AMG 562  Non-Hodgkins lymphoma AMG 570  Systemic lupus erythematosus AMG 592  Inflammatory diseases AMG 596  Glioblastoma AMG 598  Obesity AMG 673  Acute myeloid leukemia AMG 701  Multiple myeloma AMG 757  Small-cell lung cancer AMG 890  Cardiovascular disease AMG 966  Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohns and ulcerative colitis) AMG 986  Heart failure ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Phase 3 Clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study; typically performed with registrational intent.

Phase 3 and 2 Program Descriptions The following provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials. BLINCYTO   BLINCYTO  is an anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 (BiTE  ) bispecific antibody construct. A phase 2/3 study in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is ongoing. ENBREL ENBREL is a fusion protein that inhibits tumor necrosis factor. A phase 3 study to evaluate ENBREL as a monotherapy in maintaining remission in rheumatoid arthritis is ongoing. EVENITY TM  EVENITY TM is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin. It is being evaluated as a treatment for osteoporosis. EVENITY TM is being developed in collaboration with UCB. In January 2019, we and UCB announced support from the FDA BRUDAC for the approval of EVENITY TM for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Also in January 2019, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare granted a marketing authorization for EVENITY TM for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. IMLYGIC   IMLYGIC  is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from herpes simplex virus type 1. A phase 1b/3 study to evaluate IMLYGIC  in combination with Merck  Company, Inc.s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA  (pembrolizumab), in patients with mid- to late-stage metastatic melanoma is ongoing. KYPROLIS   KYPROLIS  is a proteasome inhibitor. In April 2018, we announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for KYPROLIS  to include the final overall survival data from the phase 3 ASPIRE study. In June 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA to add the positive overall survival data from the phase 3 ASPIRE study to the U.S. Prescribing Information for KYPROLIS  in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In October 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA to expand the Prescribing Information for KYPROLIS  to include a once-weekly dosing option in combination with dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. A phase 3 study comparing carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab to carfilzomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is ongoing. Omecamtiv mecarbil Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small-molecule activator of cardiac myosin. It is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, Inc., and in collaboration with Servier for certain territories. A phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study for the treatment of chronic heart failure is ongoing. Tezepelumab Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin. It is being evaluated as a treatment for severe asthma in an ongoing phase 3 study, as well as atopic dermatitis. Tezepelumab is being developed jointly in collaboration with AstraZeneca. AMG 520 / CNP520 AMG 520 / CNP520 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE). It is being evaluated for the prevention of Alzheimers disease, with phase 3 studies ongoing. AMG 520 / CNP520 is being developed jointly in collaboration with Novartis. AMG 714 / PRV-015 AMG 714 / PRV-015 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to Interleukin-15. It is being investigated for the treatment of celiac disease. In November 2017, Amgen reacquired the AMG 714 program from Celimmune LLC. AMG 714 / PRV-015 is being developed jointly in collaboration with Provention Bio. Amgen Development of Biosimilars We also develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines. Our biosimilar product candidates in late-stage clinical development are described in the following table: ##TABLE_START Program  Reference product  Status ABP 710  Infliximab (REMICADE  )  Filed BLA with the FDA and MAA with the EMA ABP 798  Rituximab (Rituxan  / Mabthera  )  Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis study completed Phase 3 non-Hodgkins lymphoma study ongoing ABP 959  Eculizumab (Soliris  )  Phase 3 initiated ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to the above programs, AMJEVITA TM / AMGEVITA TM and MVASI TM have been approved by the FDA and the EC. KANJINTI TM has been approved by the EC and we have refiled our BLA with the FDA. We are also pursuing other biosimilar product candidates in earlier-stage development. Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the RD, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information. Kirin-Amgen, Inc. During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), from Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin), making K-A a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Prior to the closing of the share acquisition, K-A was a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin. K-A develops and then licenses all product rights that have been transferred from Amgen and Kirin. See Part IVNote 3, Business combinations and Note 10, Related party transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to the closing of the share acquisition, K-A had given us exclusive licenses to manufacture and market (i) filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in the United States; Europe; Canada; Australia; New Zealand; all Central American, South American, Middle Eastern and African countries; and certain countries in Asia; (ii) darbepoetin alfa and romiplostim in the United States; Europe; Canada; Australia; New Zealand; Mexico; all Central and South American countries and certain countries in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States. We currently market pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, recombinant human erythropoietin and romiplostim under the brand names Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  /GRANULOKINE  , Aranesp  , EPOGEN  and Nplate  , respectively. Under these agreements, Amgen paid K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Amgen received payments from K-A for milestones earned and for conducting certain RD activities on K-As behalf. K-A has also given and continues to grant Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market (i) filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea; (ii) darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim and brodalumab in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and certain other countries and/or regions in Asia; and (iii) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan. K-A also gave Kirin and Amgen co-exclusive licenses to manufacture and market filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin in China, which Amgen subsequently assigned to Kirin, and as a result, Kirin now manufactures and markets filgrastim and recombinant human erythropoietin exclusively in China. Kirin markets filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, darbepoetin alfa, romiplostim, recombinant human erythropoietin and brodalumab under the brand names GRAN  /Grasin  , Peglasta  /Neulasta  /G-Lasta  , NESP  /Aranesp  , ROMIPLATE  , ESPO  and LUMICEF  , respectively. Under these agreements, Kirin pays K-A royalties based on product sales. In addition, Kirin receives payments from K-A for conducting certain RD activities on K-As behalf. Novartis In April 2017, we expanded our existing migraine collaboration with Novartis. In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig  . Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig  in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig  and other specified migraine programs. Novartis pays Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the products in the Novartis exclusive territories and funds a portion of global RD expenses. In addition, Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig  in the United States. Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig  worldwide. UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY TM . Under our collaboration, UCB has the rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY TM for all indications in Europe, China (excluding Hong Kong) and Brazil. All other territories have been allocated to Amgen. Generally, development costs and future worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses are shared equally. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. We are in a collaboration with Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Bayer) to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar  (sorafenib). In 2015, we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Bayer, which terminated the co-promotion agreement in the United States and transferred all U.S. operational responsibilities to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the termination of the co-promotion agreement, we co-promoted Nexavar  with Bayer and shared equally in the profits in the United States. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on U.S. sales of Nexavar  at a percentage rate in the high 30s. Outside the United States and Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all sales and marketing expenditures and mutually agreed RD expenses, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside the United States and Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer. DaVita Inc. In January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), which superseded the previously existing seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico.

(These website addresses are not intended to function as hyperlinks, and the information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, the public discussions of drug pricing issues are likely to continue. Changing federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sales of our products A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from U.S. federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by the U.S. federal and state governments. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. Our business has and will continue to be impacted by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. For example, in February 2018, the U.S. Congress passed legislation requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to provide greater discounts beginning in 2019 on products dispensed to patients in the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit of Medicare Part D and the programs catastrophic-coverage threshold, which will reduce our net product sales relating to such patients. Additional legislative proposals have been introduced by members of Congress to overhaul provisions of the Patient Protection and ACA, to allow commercial-level re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices with biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased since the Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2018. For example, in January 2019, the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies drug pricing. Both that committee and the Senate Finance Committee held committee hearings in January 2019 on the topic of drug pricing and have indicated that further committee hearings on the topic are likely. Also our business has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive actions, federal regulations, or federal demonstration projects. For example, in May 2018, the U.S. presidential administration released a drug pricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs. This blueprint includes a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly impact, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such proposals include moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D, instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare, removing the safe harbor protection under the federal anti-kickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers, and requiring the inclusion of drug price information in direct-to-consumer drug advertising. Since that time, the president and/or federal agencies, such as CMS, have announced a number of demonstration projects, recommendations and proposals to implement various elements described in the drug pricing blueprint. CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces, has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. For example, in October 2018, President Trump announced that CMS was evaluating a pilot program proposed to initially cover fifty percent of spending on Part B single-source drugs referred to as the International Price Index that would, among other things, set the Medicare payment amount for such single-source drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. CMS has taken additional actions to implement other elements described in the administrations drug-pricing blueprint, including issuing guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy and proposing lower reimbursement rates for new Part B drugs. And on January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a proposal to revise the federal anti-kickback statute safe harbor regulations to exclude from safe harbor protection certain rebates and other forms of remuneration paid by a manufacturer of prescription drugs to Medicaid managed care organizations or plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through PBMs. Further, CMS has undertaken demonstration projects to test care models, such as the CMS Oncology Care Model, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively impacting the efficacy of care. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, CMS has solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. In this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy, legislative or regulatory changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or impact our decisions regarding the pricing of biopharmaceutical products or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. Changing state reimbursement and pricing actions may impact access to and have impacted and may continue to impact sales of our products At the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states have discussed and debated and are considering, new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be impacting industry pricing decisions. For example, in October 2017, California enacted a drug-pricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Other states are seeking to change the way their states pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. For example, in August 2018 the Ohio Department of Medicaid ordered that all the states Medicaid managed care plans terminate and renegotiate contracts with PBMs to eliminate the drug purchasing model in which PBMs bill the state more than they reimburse pharmacists for filling Medicaid patient prescriptions. In January 2019, Californias governor issued an executive order expanding state Medicaid coverage and directing state agencies and programs to consolidate drug purchases and to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. U.S. commercial payer actions have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sales of our products Payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their and their respective members costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and limitations on patients use of manufacturer commercial co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as requiring that patients first try a drug preferred by the payer or receive the payers prior authorization before covering the product, or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of fully-owned specialty pharmacies; payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, the burdensome administrative processes required for physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria has limited and may continue to limit patient access to Repatha  treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha  by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has and may continue to limit patient use. For example, a very high percentage of Medicare patients have abandoned their Repatha  prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. In late 2018 and early 2019, we introduced a set of new NDCs to make Repatha  available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare. Despite the recent net and list price reductions, payers may continue to restrict patient access, change formulary coverage for Repatha  , seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha  . Further, our introduction of the new NDCs may not be rapidly adopted by payers, which could continue to limit patient use and could also reduce our sales of Repatha  . Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, the top three PBMs now oversee greater than two-thirds of prescription claims as well as government and commercial covered lives. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and fees for other services being realized by those payers. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, two of the nations largest PBMs, Express Scripts and CVS Health, completed their combinations with major insurance companies Cigna and Aetna, respectively. Additional consolidation would further increase the leverage of such entities. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have impacted and will continue to impact access to and sales of our products Outside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Item 1. BusinessReimbursement. International reference pricing (IRP) has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries. IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or that it does not meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMAs May 2018 approval of Repatha  for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, reimbursement for Repatha  in France and Germany has remained limited to narrower patient populations (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following national health technology assessments in mid-2018. While the pricing and reimbursement process in those countries remains ongoing, these assessments currently limit our efforts in France and Germany to expand Repatha  access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period would accelerate such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate. In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries have adopted and others are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products, and other countries may adopt similar measures. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of competitive impact of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being impacted by biosimilar competition is increasing. In the United States, the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Sandozs Zarxio  , is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  and was launched in the United States in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of ENBREL, Neulasta  and EPOGEN  , and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Two biosimilar versions of Neulasta  are now marketed in the United States and others may receive approval in 2019. Impact to our Neulasta  sales could accelerate as additional competitors are launched. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. The approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN  has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigation with the manufacturer of the approved version of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars may attempt to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biosimilars, which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products or could encourage prescribers or payers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products or our biosimilars. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. For example, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference products original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as umbrella exclusivity). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, public, legislative, and FDA efforts to promote price competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar entry, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability and provide greater clarity for how to do so, and through changes to the reimbursement policies for biologics. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our small-molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. Our U.S. composition of matter patent for Sensipar  , a small-molecule product, expired in March 2018. We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar  surrounding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. Several of these generic versions of Sensipar  have been approved by the FDA, and the manufacturer of one of the approved generic versions began selling its product in late 2018 before reaching a settlement agreement with us in early January 2019. We were subsequently sued by a manufacturer of another approved generic version of Sensipar  who is contending that provisions of its own settlement agreement with Amgen have been triggered by the first manufacturers at-risk launch, giving this second manufacturer a right to market its own generic version under its settlement agreement. See Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While no generic versions of Sensipar  are currently available for sale, one or more other companies may elect to launch their approved generic versions at-risk prior to the conclusion of our ongoing litigation, or may seek and obtain a judicial declaration that they are permitted to launch their generic versions. If this happens, our product sales for Sensipar  could be materially and adversely affected. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our products face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products may compete against products that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, and are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we are facing patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products. For example, we are currently engaged in litigation in the United States regarding MVASI TM , KANJINTI TM and AMJEVITA TM , and in Europe we are engaged in litigation regarding AMGEVITA TM . While we may attempt to challenge the patents held by the companies manufacturing, marketing or selling the applicable reference products, our efforts may be unsuccessful. Alternatively, such patents may contribute to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. For information related to our patent litigation, see Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired. See Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. For example, CVS Caremark indicated in August 2018 that it will begin utilizing third-party cost effectiveness analyses to make formulary and coverage determinations for newly-approved drugs. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets.  We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. While federal employees have since returned to work, a subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDAs activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates, and our product approvals. Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by progression-free survival (PFS). Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, or the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDL-C levels. However, the FDA initially approved Repatha  in 2015 only for a subset of those patients, citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events. In December 2017, the FDA granted broader approval of Repatha  to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels. Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO  under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1 percent. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. BusinessGovernment RegulationPost-approval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks, and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: ##TABLE_START  revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  product recalls of our approved products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies. ##TABLE_END For example, the FDA is currently evaluating our BLA for EVENITY TM for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In January 2018, the FDAs BRUDAC recommended that the FDA approve EVENITY TM , but also suggested that the FDA require appropriate post-marketing review to evaluate a potential cardiovascular risk seen in one of the EVENITY TM pivotal clinical trials. See Item 1. BusinessSignificant Developments. While the FDA is not bound to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, it often does; if the FDA approves EVENITY TM it may require that we complete a post-marketing study, which could be time consuming and costly. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure first-to-market or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD. Amgen invests heavily in RD. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few RD projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: ##TABLE_START  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval. ##TABLE_END We have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our research and development decisions and investments. We have focused our RD strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above. A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in May 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPRD) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening patients for our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In such diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta  is available as part of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit, and our AutoTouch  reusable auto-injector is used with Enbrel Mini  single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates may also require the use of a companion diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events, and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and impacts to our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017 the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products. Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness Relationships. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us, or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for research and development and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, impact the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.  The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax. Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRSs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Although final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months, such resolution could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The 2017 Tax Act is complex and further regulations and interpretations are still being issued. We could face audit challenges on how we apply the new law that could have a negative impact on our provision for income taxes. A change to the U.S. tax system, such as a repeal or modification of the 2017 Tax Act, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, such as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or changes in tax law in the United States or other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations. We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales . We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates. In addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane destroyed residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, communications networks and most of Puerto Ricos electric grid. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm, the restoration of electrical service on the island was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from back-up diesel powered generators for some time. In January 2018, we reconnected to the Puerto Rico electric grid but have continued to use diesel generators as needed when sufficient electric power has not been reliably available. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or even return to using them exclusively. In addition, future storms or other disasters or events could cause a more significant impact to our manufacturing operations. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility (whether due to problems with the facility itself, the infrastructure and services available on the island, the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors, the unavailability of key staff or otherwise) or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales . The impact of Hurricane Maria placed greater stress on the islands already challenged economy. Prior to Hurricane Maria, the government of Puerto Rico was unable to pay its roughly $72 billion in debt. In June 2016, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in its debt restructuring. In May 2017, after negotiations for debt restructuring with creditors were unsuccessful, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Governor of Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency and authorized a moratorium on the payment of general obligation bonds and other debts issued by certain instrumentalities, which moratorium has been extended and may continue to be extended while the Oversight Board is in effect. Given the severe conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, resolution of Puerto Ricos debt situation through the PROMESA judicial process has been delayed. In the case of PREPA, the effects of Hurricane Maria and several changes in PREPAs management have delayed reconstruction efforts. In June 2018, the Oversight Board certified a budget for Puerto Ricos fiscal year 2019 that imposes significant expense reductions across the government. The Title III Court upheld government challenges to the budget, and the Governor and Legislature of Puerto Rico have now filed appeals before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In addition, certain non-governmental entities have brought suit claiming the appointment process of the Oversight Board members set forth in PROMESA conflicts with the appointments clause of the U.S. Constitution. If the First Circuit were to hold that PROMESA has a constitutional infirmity and that actions taken by the Oversight Board are invalid, the commencement of all Title III proceedings could be invalid. In such event, the current debt restructuring process and the debtholder litigation stay under Title III of PROMESA could be in jeopardy. In October 2018, the fiscal plan for Puerto Rico was updated, including a projected increase in federal disaster funding and projected material deficits once the stimulus effects of the disaster recovery dissipate. The fiscal plan stresses the importance of structural reforms to address Puerto Ricos challenging economic and demographic trends that may be difficult to implement as well as have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act will no longer permit deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings of U.S. companies (or their foreign subsidiaries), although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced 10.5% rate. Given Puerto Ricos challenged economy and hurricane recovery needs, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base due to competition from other foreign locations subject to a similar level of U.S. taxation, or U.S. locations due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The manufacturing sector contributes more than 45% of Puerto Ricos gross domestic product, and multinational companies with Puerto Rico operations contribute approximately 30% of Puerto Ricos revenue base. While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, there is still a risk that Puerto Ricos ongoing economic challenges, the effects of Hurricane Maria and the potential impact of the 2017 Tax Act could negatively affect the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business, create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Insulet Corporation is our single-source of the on-body injector for our Neulasta  Onpro   kit. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: ##TABLE_START  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters. ##TABLE_END For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. BusinessManufacturing, Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by: ##TABLE_START  capacity of manufacturing facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with regulatory requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in forecasts of future demand; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  updates of manufacturing specifications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing and outcome of product quality testing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  power failures and/or other utility failures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment; and/or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal government shutdown. ##TABLE_END If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix  distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on the product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to implement such changes. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN  , is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN  sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability . The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively impacting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, it could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal RD and external transactions including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (acquisition activity). We have an ongoing process of evaluating such potential acquisition activity opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our RD pipeline. Acquisitions or similar arrangements may be complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important RD, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications . As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. These legal and operational challenges along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales, business and results of operations. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the U.S. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices and agreed to operate under a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which was formally closed out in August 2018. We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. To achieve our business objectives, we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or affect our reputation. Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our RD efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of key loggers or other harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, and can be deployed through malicious websites, the use of social engineering and/or other means. Attacks such as those seen with other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively impacted. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other business partners. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) by employees, service providers, nation states, organized crime organizations, hacktivists or others, pose risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. Finally, domestic and global government regulators, our key business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with important business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers. Although in the past we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection, and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or impact our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data. Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability . As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors, customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially impacted. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Overview Amgen is a highly focused biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the worlds leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal productsthose with the most significant annual commercial salesare ENBREL, Neulasta  , Prolia  , Aranesp  , XGEVA  , Sensipar  /Mimpara  and EPOGEN  . We also market a number of other products, including KYPROLIS  , Nplate  , Vectibix  , Repatha  , NEUPOGEN  , Parsabiv  , BLINCYTO  , Aimovig  , IMLYGIC  , Corlanor  , KANJINTI TM and AMGEVITA TM . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Our strategy includes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. In 2018, we advanced our strategy while delivering strong financial performance and returning capital to shareholders, advancing our innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, increasing our global geographic reach and expanding our next-generation manufacturing capabilities. In 2018, total product sales increased 3% driven primarily by Prolia  , XGEVA  , Repatha  and KYPROLIS  , along with our recently launched products Aimovig  and Parsabiv  . Product sales grew 2% in the United States and 9% in the rest of the world. Total operating expenses increased 5% as we supported our recently launched products and RD pipeline, including early oncology assets. Cash inflows from operating activities were $11.3 billion , enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock. In December 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2019. We also repurchased 94.5 million shares of our common stock throughout 2018 at an aggregate cost of $17.9 billion. In addition to launching Aimovig  in the United States and Parsabiv  in the United States and the EU, we received approvals for new indications for Repatha  and Prolia  , along with KYPROLIS  , BLINCYTO  , XGEVA  and Nplate  within our oncology/hematology portfolio. We continued to strengthen our international footprint with the approvals of Repatha  in China, and in early 2019, EVENITY TM in Japan. In addition to these commercial products, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative first-in-class molecules, including our phase 3 molecule, tezepelumab. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype. We have also continued to invest in external innovation to augment our internal innovation with a focus when possible, on genetic related investments and genetically validated targets. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the approval of MVASI TM for the treatment of five types of cancer in the United States and the EU, and the launches of KANJINTI TM and AMGEVITA TM in Europe. Lastly, we made regulatory submissions for ABP 710 in the United States and the EU. We broke ground on our new next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Rhode Island in 2018. This new plant will be the first of its kind in the United States and will use our proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities to manufacture our products while maintaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Our first next-generation biomanufacturing facility located in Singapore is already in use for certain commercial-scale production for multiple countries. While 2018 execution was strong, we face competition on our more mature products. We have established productivity initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents and see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. We devote considerable resources to RD activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private health care provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected Financial Information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017 Product sales:      U.S. $ 17,429  %  $ 17,131 Rest of world (ROW) 5,104  %  4,664 Total product sales 22,533  %  21,795 Other revenues 1,214  %  1,054 Total revenues $ 23,747  %  $ 22,849 Operating expenses $ 13,484  %  $ 12,876 Operating income $ 10,263  %  $ 9,973 Net income $ 8,394  *  $ 1,979 Diluted EPS $ 12.62  *  $ 2.69 Diluted shares  (10 )%  ##TABLE_END* Change in excess of 100% In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end-users (such as pharmacies). Total product sales increased for 2018 , driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by a decline in net selling price. For 2019, we expect net selling price to continue to decline. Other revenues increased for 2018 , driven primarily by higher milestone payments and royalties. Operating expenses increased for 2018 , driven primarily by investments in product launches and increased spend in RD, including support of our early pipeline. All expense categories continued to benefit from our transformation and process improvement efforts, which enabled investment in newer and recently launched products. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 ENBREL $ 5,014  (8 )%  $ 5,433  (9 )%  $ 5,965 Neulasta  4,475  (1 )%  4,534  (2 )%  4,648 Prolia  2,291  %  1,968  %  1,635 Aranesp  1,877  (9 )%  2,053  (2 )%  2,093 XGEVA  1,786  %  1,575  %  1,529 Sensipar  /Mimpara  1,774  %  1,718  %  1,582 EPOGEN  1,010  (8 )%  1,096  (15 )%  1,282 Other products 4,306  %  3,418  %  3,158 Total product sales $ 22,533  %  $ 21,795   %  $ 21,892 Total U.S. $ 17,429  %  $ 17,131  (1 )%  $ 17,325 Total ROW 5,104  %  4,664  %  4,567 Total product sales $ 22,533  %  $ 21,795   %  $ 21,892 ##TABLE_ENDFuture sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1.

In addition, for a list of our products significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 ENBREL  U.S. $ 4,807  (8 )%  $ 5,206  (9 )%  $ 5,719 ENBREL  Canada  (9 )%   (8 )%  Total ENBREL $ 5,014  (8 )% $ 5,433  (9 )%  $ 5,965 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price. The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price, offset partially by an increase in inventory. For 2019, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigation with the company seeking to market the biosimilar version of ENBREL approved by the FDA in 2016. See Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Neulasta   Total Neulasta  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 Neulasta   U.S. $ 3,866  (2 )%  $ 3,931   %  $ 3,925 Neulasta   ROW  %   (17 )%  Total Neulasta  $ 4,475  (1 )% $ 4,534  (2 )%  $ 4,648 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in global Neulasta  sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. Neulasta  sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government. The decrease in global Neulasta  sales for 2017 was driven primarily by lower unit demand, offset partially by an increase in net selling price in the United States. Neulasta  sales have been and will continue to be affected by the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new treatment alternatives, including those that have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of myelosuppressive regimens in some patients. Our final material U.S. patent for Neulasta  expired in October 2015. Therefore, we face competition in the United States, which over time may have a material adverse impact on future sales of Neulasta  . A biosimilar version of Neulasta  was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in July 2018, and another biosimilar version was approved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in January 2019. Other biosimilar versions of Neulasta  may also receive approval in the near future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations with these and other companies that are developing proposed biosimilar versions of Neulasta  , see Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, supplementary protection certificates issued by certain countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, that are related to our European patent for Neulasta  expired in August 2017. In 2019, we expect European sales to decline with the launch of multiple long-acting biosimilar competitors. Prolia   Total Prolia  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 Prolia   U.S. $ 1,500  %  $ 1,272  %  $ 1,049 Prolia   ROW  %   %  Total Prolia  $ 2,291  %  $ 1,968  %  $ 1,635 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global Prolia  sales for 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by higher unit demand. Aranesp   Total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 Aranesp   U.S. $  (15 )%  $ 1,114  %  $ 1,082 Aranesp   ROW   %   (7 )%  1,011 Total Aranesp  $ 1,877  (9 )% $ 2,053  (2 )%  $ 2,093 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in global Aranesp  sales for 2018 was driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand. The decrease in global Aranesp  sales for 2017 was driven primarily by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset partially by higher unit demand, including a shift of some U.S. dialysis centers from EPOGEN  . Aranesp  faces competition from a long-acting product. Aranesp  also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN  , which w as approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  may also receive approval. In 2019, we expect sales in the United States to decline at a faster rate than 2018 due to short- and long- acting competition. XGEVA   Total XGEVA  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 XGEVA   U.S. $ 1,338  %  $ 1,157  %  $ 1,115 XGEVA   ROW  %   %  Total XGEVA  $ 1,786  %  $ 1,575  %  $ 1,529 ##TABLE_ENDThe increases in global XGEVA  sales for 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by higher unit demand. Sensipar  /Mimpara   Total Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 Sensipar   U.S. $ 1,436  %  $ 1,374  %  $ 1,240 Sensipar  /Mimpara   ROW  (2 )%   %  Total Sensipar  /Mimpara  $ 1,774  % $ 1,718  %  $ 1,582 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in global Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales for 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by lower unit demand. The increase in global Sensipar  /Mimpara  sales for 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States and, to a lesser extent, higher unit demand. Our U.S. composition of matter patent related to Sensipar  , a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in patent litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar  , one of which began selling its generic version in late December 2018 until reaching a settlement agreement with us in early January 2019. In a separate litigation, we have been sued by the manufacturer of another approved generic version of Sensipar  who is contending that provisions of its own settlement agreement with Amgen have been triggered by the first manufacturers at-risk launch, giving this second manufacturer a right to market its own generic version under its settlement agreement. See Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2019, we expect Sensipar  sales will be lower than 2018 due to the temporary generic market entry, continued adoption of Parsabiv  and higher purchases in 2018 due to the reimbursement change from Medicare Part D to Part B. Further, generic competitors may enter the market at risk at any time. EPOGEN   Total EPOGEN  sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Year ended December 31, 2018  Change  Year ended December 31, 2017  Change  Year ended December 31, 2016 EPOGEN   U.S. $ 1,010  (8 )%  $ 1,096  (15 )%  $ 1,282 ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2018 was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita (see Part I, Item I. BusinessBusiness Relationships). In 2019, we expect a more significant decline in net selling price. The decrease in EPOGEN  sales for 2017 was driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to contractual terms negotiated with DaVita and, to a lesser extent, a shift in some U.S. dialysis centers to A ranesp  . Our final material U.S. patent for EPOGEN  expired in May 2015. We face competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN  . Multiple companies are developing proposed biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  . A biosimilar version of EPOGEN  was approved in the second quarter of 2018 and launched in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  may also receive approval. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation with one of these companies, see Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of these efforts, we committed to a more agile and efficient operating model. Our transformation and process improvement efforts across the Company are enabling us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. The transformation included a restructuring plan, and the activities associated with the restructuring plan have been completed. As of December 31, 2018 , restructuring costs incurred to date were $ 809 million. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we incurred restructuring costs of $12 million, $88 million and $37 million, respectively. Since 2014, we have realized approximately $1.9 billion of transformation and process improvement savings. Net savings have not been significant as savings were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IVNote 2, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of sales Cost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018 , driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs. Cost of sales decreased to 17.8% of total revenues for 2017 , driven primarily by lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, lower royalty costs and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. Research and development The Company groups all of its RD activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Research and early pipeline (formerly Discovery Research and Translational Sciences), (2) later-stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories are described below: ##TABLE_START Category  Description Research and early pipeline  RD expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later-stage clinical programs  RD expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products  RD expenses incurred in support of the Companys marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_ENDRD expense by category was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Research and early pipeline $ 1,201  $  $ 1,039 Later-stage clinical programs 1,034   1,054 Marketed products 1,502  1,711  1,747 Total RD expense $ 3,737  $ 3,562  $ 3,840 ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in RD expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed product support. The decrease in RD expense for 2017 was driven by decreased costs associated with later-stage clinical program support, lower external business development expense in research and early pipeline and lower marketed product support. Selling, general and administrative The increase in Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed product support. The decrease in SGA expense for 2017 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL residual royalty payments on October 31, 2016, offset partially by investments in product launches and marketed product support. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired in October 2013, and we were required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of ENBREL net sales in the United States and Canada. Effective November 2016, there were no further residual royalty payments. The residual royalty percentage ranged from 10% to 11% in 2016. Other Other operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration. See Part IVNote 14, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to our restructuring plan. Other operating expenses for 2016 included $105 million of charges related to legal proceedings. Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxes Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Interest expense, net $ 1,392  $ 1,304  $ 1,260 Interest and other income, net $  $  $ Provision for income taxes $ 1,151  $ 7,618  $ 1,441 Effective tax rate 12.1 %  79.4 %  15.7 % ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense, net The increase in Interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt. The increase in Interest expense, net, for 2017 was due primarily to a higher average amount of debt outstanding compared with the prior year. Interest and other income, net The decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income that resulted from higher average investment balances and higher gains on strategic investments. Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposes a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits. None of the adjustments we made to our provisional amounts were material to our consolidated financial statements. As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRSs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesIncome taxes, and Part IVNote 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  December 31,   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 29,304  $ 41,678 Total assets $ 66,416  $ 79,954 Current portion of long-term debt $ 4,419  $ 1,152 Long-term debt $ 29,510  $ 34,190 Stockholders equity $ 12,500  $ 25,241 ##TABLE_ENDCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities We have global access to our $29.3 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest the related undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a repatriation tax liability on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion, which will be paid over eight years. The first annual payment was made in April 2018. See Contractual Obligations below. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Capital allocation Consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. We intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock paid in 2016 , increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017 , and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018 . In December 2018 , the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.45 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2019. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2018 , we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion , which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In 2017 and 2016 , we repurchased $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , $5.1 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. As a result of stock repurchases, including our recent tender offer, and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business . Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018 , were $ 4.4 billion and $ 29.5 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2017 , were $ 1.2 billion and $ 34.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , Standard  Poors Financial Services LLC (SP), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. During 2018 , we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2017 and 2016 , we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion and $7.3 billion , respectively. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we repaid debt of $1.1 billion , $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion , respectively. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $10.95 billion and $9.45 billion, respectively. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion . As of December 31, 2018 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2018 and 2016 , we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. In 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. We extended this term by one year during 2016 and may extend the term for an additional year with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 1% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2020. Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which was modified during 2018. The modified covenant requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest expense, each as defined and described in the amended credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2018 . See Part IVNote 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows Our summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,296  $ 11,177  $ 10,354 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 14,339  $ (4,024 )  $ (8,658 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (22,490 )  $ (6,594 )  $ (2,599 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 due primarily to higher operating margin and the timing of payments to vendors and receipts from customers, offset partially by higher payments to taxing authorities. Investing Cash provided by investing activities during 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $15.0 billion and cash used in investing activities during 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion , and $7.7 billion , respectively. Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with site development costs, including our Thousand Oaks campus, as well as the new next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island and life-cycle investments across the manufacturing network, were $738 million , $664 million and $738 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We currently estimate 2019 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion , the payment of dividends of $3.5 billion , repayment of debt of $1.1 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $126 million . Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $3.4 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $191 million , offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayment, of $71 million . Cash used in financing activities during 2016 was due primarily to the payment of dividends of $3.0 billion , repurchases of our common stock of $3.0 billion and withholding taxes arising from shares withheld for share-based payments of $260 million , offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayment, of $3.6 billion . See Part IVNote 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period as of December 31, 2018 Contractual obligations  Total  Year 1  Years 2 and 3  Years 4 and 5  Years 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3)  $ 54,276  $ 5,856  $ 8,777  $ 7,444  $ 32,199 Operating lease obligations (4)      Purchase obligations (5)  1,153     U.S. repatriation tax (6)  6,739   1,172  1,685  3,296 Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7)           Total contractual obligations  $ 62,737  $ 7,215  $ 10,493  $ 9,373  $ 35,656 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2018 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $77 million. See Part IVNote 16, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2018 , in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IVNote 16, Financing arrangements,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we enter into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IVNote 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Operating lease obligations exclude $203 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) RD commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations in eight annual installments. See Part IVNote 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.5 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IVNote 18, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Rebates  Chargebacks  Other deductions  Total Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 1,119  $  $  $ 1,486 Amounts charged against product sales 3,479  5,270   9,654 Payments (3,181 )  (5,201 )  (884 )  (9,266 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 1,417    1,874 Amounts charged against product sales 4,909  6,098   11,999 Payments (4,459 )  (6,168 )  (999 )  (11,626 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 1,867    2,247 Amounts charged against product sales 6,180  6,926  1,180  14,286 Payments (5,458 )  (6,744 )  (1,161 )  (13,363 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 2,589  $  $  $ 3,170 ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , total sales deductions were 39% , 35% and 31% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, was driven primarily by the impact of higher sales, increases in U.S. rebates and chargebacks, as well as timing of payments. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels, and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return, but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which imposes a repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposes a current tax on certain foreign earnings and lowers the general corporate income tax rate to 21%. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including the repatriation tax, the net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefits. None of the adjustments we made to our provisional amounts were material to our consolidated financial statements. As previously disclosed, we received a RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRSs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IVNote 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability . Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IVNote 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPRD product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. See Part IVNote 3, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. ##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPRD projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPRD product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPRD projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPRD project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Part IVNote 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2018. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , was composed of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities, corporate debt securities, residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market mutual funds and other short-term interest-bearing securities composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $28.7 billion and $41.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these securities of $360 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2018 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion . As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $35.3 billion and a fair value of $38.6 billion . Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates, with variable-rate debt having carrying values of $850 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , would have resulted in increases of $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $10.95 billion and $9.45 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , would have resulted in reductions in fair values of $460 million and $420 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that hedge certain of our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of $320 million and $390 million, respectively. Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2018 , we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 , would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.3 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.2 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt. We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with an aggregate notional amount of $5.6 billion , as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2018 , we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.5 billion and $21 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.6 billion and $74 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 the fair values of these contracts were a $181 million asset and a $26 million liability. As of December 31, 2017 the fair values of these contracts were a $6 million asset and a $204 million liability. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $810 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $380 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 , would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $360 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $737 million and $757 million , respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. Market-price-sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A or equivalent by SP, Moodys or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " Item 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018 . Management determined that, as of December 31, 2018 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Amgen Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Amgen Inc. as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 13, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 13, 2019  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS ##TABLE_ENDSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Existing Equity Compensation Plans  The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2018 , concerning the shares of our common stock that may be issued under any form of award granted under our equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2018 (including upon the exercise of options, the vesting of awards of restricted stock units (RSUs), or when performance units are earned, and related dividend equivalents have been granted). ##TABLE_START  (a)  (b)  (c) Plan category  Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options and rights  Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and rights  Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a)) Equity compensation plans approved by Amgen security holders:       Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (1)  9,900,975  $ 143.61  32,159,877 Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan (2)  17,030     Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan      4,634,563 Total approved plans  9,918,005  143.61  36,794,440 Equity compensation plan not approved by Amgen security holders:       Amgen Profit Sharing Plan for Employees in Ireland (3)      95,087 Total unapproved plans      95,087 Total all plans  9,918,005  $ 143.61  36,889,527 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan employs a fungible share counting formula for determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 200% of the performance units granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2018 , the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes: (i) 4,412,073 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $143.61; (ii) 3,365,817 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 172,613 related dividend equivalents); and (iii)  2,123,085 shares subject to outstanding 2016, 2017 and 2018 performance units (including 94,881 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2018 , employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units are achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018. ##TABLE_START (2)  This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 17,030 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs (including 2,577 related dividend equivalents). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The Amgen Profit Sharing Plan for Employees in Ireland (the Profit Sharing Plan) was approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2011.
