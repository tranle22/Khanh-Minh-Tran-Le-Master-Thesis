Business The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive Media. For convenience, the terms Company and we are used to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted. On December 31, 2009, the Company completed an acquisition of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (Marvel). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Marvel businesses are reported primarily in our Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segments. Information on the Companys revenues, operating income, and identifiable assets appears in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. The Company employed approximately 156,000 people as of October 1, 2011. MEDIA NETWORKS The Media Networks segment is comprised of international and domestic cable networks and our broadcasting business, which consists of a domestic broadcast television network, television production operations, domestic and international television distribution, domestic television stations, domestic and international broadcast radio networks, domestic radio stations, and publishing and digital operations. Cable Networks Our cable networks group operates the ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Family and SOAPnet networks. The cable networks group produces its own programs or acquires rights from third parties to air on our networks. The Company also has interests in joint ventures that operate programming services and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cable networks derive a majority of their revenues from fees charged to cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (Multi-channel Video Service Providers or MVSPs) and, for certain networks (primarily ESPN and ABC Family), the sale to advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. Generally, the Companys cable networks operate under multi-year carriage agreements with MVSPs that include contractually determined fees. The amounts that we can charge to MVSPs for our cable network services are largely dependent on competition and the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide. The ability to sell time for commercial announcements and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand. We also sell programming developed by our cable networks to third parties worldwide in pay and syndication markets, in DVD format and also online to third party services.  The Companys significant cable networks and our ownership percentage and estimated subscribers as of October 1, 2011 are set forth in the following table: ##TABLE_START   Estimated Subscribers (in millions)  (1)   Ownership %  ESPN ( 2 )   ESPN   99    80.0  ESPN2   99    80.0  ESPNEWS   73    80.0  ESPN Classic   33    80.0  ESPNU   72    80.0  Disney Channels Worldwide   Disney Channel - Domestic   99    100.0  Disney Channels  International ( 3 )   141    100.0  Disney Junior ( 3 )   58    100.0  Disney XD - Domestic   78    100.0  Disney XD  International ( 3 )   91    100.0  ABC Family   98    100.0  SOAPnet   74    100.0  AE/Lifetime   AE ( 2 )   99    42.1  Lifetime Television   99    42.1  HISTORY   99    42.1  Lifetime Movie Network   82    42.1  The Biography Channel   65    42.1  History International   64    42.1  Lifetime Real Women ( 3 )   18    42.1  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Estimated U.S. subscriber counts according to Nielsen Media Research as of September 2011, except as noted below ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 2 )  ESPN and AE programming is distributed internationally through other networks discussed below. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 3 )  Subscriber counts are not rated by Nielsen and are based on internal management reports. ##TABLE_END ESPN ESPN is a multimedia, multinational sports entertainment company that operates eight 24-hour domestic television sports networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNEWS, ESPN Classic, ESPN Deportes (a Spanish language network), ESPNU (a network devoted to college sports), ESPN 3D (a 3D service), and the regionally focused Longhorn Network (a network dedicated to The University of Texas athletics).

The ABC Television Network produces its own programs or acquires rights from third parties, as well as entities that are owned by or affiliated with the Company. The ABC Television Network derives the majority of its revenues from the sale to advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. The ability to sell time for commercial announcements and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand for time on network broadcasts.

Competition and Seasonality The Companys Media Networks businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks, independent television stations and other media, such as DVDs, video games and the internet. With respect to the sale of advertising time, our broadcasting operations, certain of our cable networks and our television and radio stations compete with other television networks and radio stations, independent television stations, MVSPs and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, billboards, and the internet. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for viewers in individual market areas. A television or radio station in one market generally does not compete directly with stations in other markets. The growth in the number of networks distributed by MVSPs has resulted in increased competitive pressures for advertising revenues for both our broadcasting and cable networks. The Companys cable networks also face competition from other cable networks for carriage by MVSPs. The Companys contractual agreements with MVSPs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place. The Companys Media Networks businesses also compete for the acquisition of sports and other programming. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming. The Company currently has sports rights agreements with the National Football League (NFL), college football (including college bowl games) and basketball conferences, National Basketball Association (NBA), National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), Major League Baseball (MLB), World Cup and various soccer leagues, and Golf and Tennis Associations. The Companys internet web sites and digital products compete with other web sites and entertainment products in their respective categories. Advertising revenues at the Media Networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. Federal Regulation Television and radio broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect our Media Networks segment include the following: ##TABLE_START    Licensing of television and radio stations. Each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (or the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances. Although we have generally received such renewals and approvals in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals and approvals in the future. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Television and radio station ownership limits. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. Currently: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any of the markets in which we own a television station. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience (for this purpose, FCC regulations attribute to UHF television stations only 50% of the television households in their market). For purposes of the FCCs rules, our eight stations reach approximately 21% of the national audience. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FCC regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations, but we do not believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Dual networks. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major television networks  ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC  from being under common ownership or control. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of programming. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning indecent programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during childrens programming. Broadcasters face a heightened risk of being found in violation of the indecency prohibition by the FCC because of recent FCC decisions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. In the past several years, the FCC increased enforcement activities with respect to indecency, and a number of significant indecency cases against various broadcasters remain pending in the courts. Moreover, the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming are a maximum of $325,000 per violation. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast channels are generally required to provide a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has as a significant purpose meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. With respect to cable systems operating within a television stations Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either must carry status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the stations market, or retransmission consent status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. Under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and its successors, including most recently the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA), which also requires the must carry or retransmission consent election, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television stations signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. Under must carry, if a satellite carrier elects to carry one local station in a market, the satellite carrier must carry the signals of all local television stations that also request carriage. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Digital television. Pursuant to FCC regulations, all of the Companys stations now operate exclusively on digital channels. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Cable and satellite carriage of programming. The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations regarding cable and satellite retransmission consent, and some cable and satellite companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on cable and satellite systems. Litigation has been instituted against the Company, other program providers and distributors seeking among other things to achieve similar ends. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could, depending on its specific nature, have an impact on the Companys operations. ##TABLE_END The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and other legislation and of specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCCs regulatory authority. FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

The resort is also home to a 481 unit Disney Vacation Club facility that is being constructed in phases. As of October 1, 2011, 207 vacation club units had been completed. Disneyland Paris The Company has a 51% effective ownership interest in Disneyland Paris, a 5,510-acre development located in Marne-la-Valle, approximately 20 miles east of Paris, France, which has been developed pursuant to a master agreement with French governmental authorities. The Company manages and has a 40% equity interest in Euro Disney S.C.A., a publicly-traded French entity that is the holding company for Euro Disney Associs S.C.A., the primary operating company of Disneyland Paris. Euro Disney S.C.A. and its subsidiaries operate Disneyland Paris, which includes two theme parks (Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park); seven themed hotels; convention centers; a shopping, dining and entertainment complex; and a 27-hole golf facility. Of the 5,510 acres comprising the site, approximately half have been developed to date, including the Val dEurope development discussed below. An indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is responsible for managing Disneyland Paris. Euro Disney S.C.A . is required to pay royalties and management fees to the Company based on the operating performance of the resort.  Disneyland Park  Disneyland Park, which opened in 1992, consists of five principal themed areas: Adventureland, Discoveryland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, and Main Street. These areas include themed rides, attractions, shows, restaurants, merchandise shops and refreshment stands. Disneyland Park also features a daily parade. Walt Disney Studios Park  Walt Disney Studios Park opened in March 2002 adjacent to Disneyland Park. The park takes guests into the worlds of cinema, animation and television and includes four principal themed areas: Front Lot, Toon Studios, Production Courtyard and Backlot. These areas each include themed rides, attractions, shows, restaurants, merchandise shops and refreshment stands. Hotels and Other Facilities  Disneyland Paris operates seven resort hotels, with a total of approximately 5,800 rooms and 250,000 square feet of conference meeting space. In addition, several on-site hotels that are owned and operated by third parties provide approximately 2,400 rooms. Disneyland Paris also includes Disney Village, a retail, dining and entertainment complex of approximately 500,000 square feet, located between the theme parks and the hotels. A number of the Disney Village facilities are operated by third parties that pay rent to a subsidiary of Euro Disney S.C.A. Val dEurope is a planned community that is being developed near Disneyland Paris. The completed phases of the development include: a town center, which consists of a shopping center; a 150-room hotel; office, commercial, and residential space; and a regional train station. Third parties operate these developments on land leased or purchased from Euro Disney S.C.A. and its subsidiaries. In fiscal 2005, Euro Disney S.C.A. completed a financial restructuring, which provided for an increase in capital and refinancing of its borrowings. Pursuant to the financial restructuring, the Company agreed to conditionally and unconditionally defer certain management fees and royalties and convert them into long-term subordinated debt and provide a ten-year line of credit, with a current limit of 100 million for liquidity needs. In fiscal 2010, Euro Disney S.C.A signed an amendment to the master agreement entered into between the Company and French governmental authorities in 1987 for the creation and operation of the resort. This amendment extends the duration of the agreement from 2017 to 2030. In addition, the amendment provides for updated land entitlements that allow Euro Disney S.C.A to develop, in partnership with Groupe Pierre  Vacances Center Parcs, Les Villages Nature de Val dEurope, an innovative eco-tourism project. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort The Company owns a 47% interest in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort through Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited, an entity in which the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) owns a 53% majority interest. A separate Hong Kong subsidiary of the Company is responsible for managing Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Located on 311 acres on Lantau Island, the resort is in close proximity to the Hong Kong International Airport. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort includes one theme park and two themed hotels. Hong Kong Disneyland  Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005 and consists of the following themed areas: Adventureland, Fantasyland, Main Street USA, Tomorrowland and Toy Story Land. These areas feature themed rides and attractions, shows, restaurants, merchandise shops and refreshment stands. Additionally, there are daily parades and a nighttime fireworks extravaganza. Hotels  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort includes two themed hotels with a total of 1,000 rooms. In July 2009, the Company and the HKSAR agreed to a capital realignment and expansion plan for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The expansion, which is scheduled to be completed in phases by 2013, will bring three new themed areas to Hong Kong Disneyland: Toy Story Land, which opened in November 2011; Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point. Pursuant to the plan, the Company converted a loan to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort into equity and to date, has made additional capital contributions of $259 million and the HKSAR has contributed like amounts of capital by converting a portion of its loan to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort into equity. This has increased the Companys effective ownership interest from 43% to 47% as of October 1, 2011. The Company expects to make additional capital contributions to fund the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the operating performance of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, the Company is entitled to receive royalties and management fees.  Shanghai Disney Resort On April 8, 2011, the Company and Shanghai Shendi (Group) Co., Ltd (Shendi) announced that the Chinese central government in Beijing had approved an agreement to build and operate a Disney resort (Shanghai Disney Resort) in the Pudong district of Shanghai. On opening day, the Shanghai Disney Resort will be located on roughly 1,000 acres, with additional room to expand in the future, and will include the Shanghai Disneyland theme park; two themed hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms; a retail, dining and entertainment complex; and an outdoor recreational area. Shanghai Disney Resort is currently targeted to open in approximately five years. Construction and operation of the project will be the responsibility of a joint venture in which Shendi owns a 57% interest and the Company owns 43%. Construction has commenced and we expect the total investment to be approximately 24.5 billion yuan to build the theme park and an additional 4.5 billion yuan to build other aspects of the resort, including the hotels and the retail, dining and entertainment area. The investment amounts will be funded in accordance with each partners equity ownership percentage. In addition, a joint venture management company has been formed which is responsible for creating, developing and operating the resort, with Disney having a 70% stake and Shendi owning 30%. The management company will be entitled to receive management fees based on project operations. In addition to the management fees and equity interest, the Company will earn royalties on revenues generated by the resort. Tokyo Disney Resort Tokyo Disney Resort is located on approximately 494 acres of land, six miles east of downtown Tokyo, Japan. The resort includes two theme parks (Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea); three Disney-branded hotels; six independently operated hotels; and a retail, dining and entertainment complex. Tokyo Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983, was the first Disney theme park to open outside the United States. Tokyo Disneyland consists of seven principal areas: Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Toontown, Westernland and World Bazaar. Tokyo DisneySea  Tokyo DisneySea, adjacent to Tokyo Disneyland, opened in 2001. The park is divided into seven ports of call, including Mediterranean Harbor, American Waterfront, Port Discovery, Lost River Delta, Mermaid Lagoon, Mysterious Island and Arabian Coast. Hotels and Other Resort Facilities - The resort includes three Disney-branded hotels with a total of more than 1,700 rooms. The resort also includes the Disney Resort Line monorail, which links theme parks and resort hotels with Ikspiari, a retail, dining and entertainment complex, and Bon Voyage, a Disney-themed merchandise location. The Company earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land Co., Ltd. (OLC), a Japanese corporation in which the Company has no equity interest. OLC markets the Tokyo Disney Resort through a variety of local, domestic and international advertising and promotional activities. Disney Vacation Club The Disney Vacation Club offers ownership interests in 11 resort facilities located at the Walt Disney World Resort; Disneyland Resort; Vero Beach, Florida; Hilton Head Island, South Carolina; and Oahu, Hawaii. Available units at each facility are offered for sale under a vacation ownership plan and are operated as hotel rooms when not occupied by vacation club members. The Companys vacation club units consist of a mix of units ranging from one bedroom studios to three bedroom villas. Unit counts in this document are presented in terms of two bedroom equivalents. Disney Vacation Club has 3,267 vacation club units as of October 1, 2011 and is scheduled to open an additional 274 units at Aulani, a 21-acre oceanfront resort on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The resort, which opened its first phase in August 2011, also has a total of 359 traditional hotel rooms. Disney Cruise Line Disney Cruise Line, which is generally operated out of Port Canaveral, Florida and Port of Los Angeles, California, is a vacation cruise line that includes three ships: the Disney Magic , the Disney Wonder and the Disney Dream which launched in January 2011. The Company is constructing a fourth ship, the Disney Fantasy, which will launch in March 2012. The ships cater to children, families and adults, with distinctly-themed areas and activities for each group. The Disney Magic and the Disney Wonder are 85,000-ton ships which feature 877 staterooms, while the Disney Dream and the Disney Fantasy are 130,000 ton ships with 1,250 staterooms. Cruise vacations originating from Port Canaveral include a visit to Disneys Castaway Cay, a 1,000-acre private Bahamian island.  Adventures by Disney Adventures by Disney offers all-inclusive guided vacation tour packages predominantly at non-Disney sites around the world. The Company provided 22 excursion packages during 2011. Walt Disney Imagineering Walt Disney Imagineering provides master planning, real estate development, attraction, entertainment and show design, engineering support, production support, project management and other development services, including research and development for the Companys operations. Competition and Seasonality The Companys theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, and weather patterns and natural disasters. All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, the theme parks and resorts business experiences fluctuations in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT The Studio Entertainment segment produces and acquires live-action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video content, musical recordings and live stage plays. The Company distributes produced and acquired films (including its film and television library) in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets with a focus on Disney-branded films under the Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar banners and Marvel-branded films. The Company also distributes films under the Touchstone Pictures banner. Each of the market windows is discussed in more detail below. In August 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with DreamWorks Studios (DreamWorks) to distribute live-action motion pictures produced by DreamWorks over the next seven years under the Touchstone Pictures banner. Under the agreement, the Company distributed I Am Number Four, The Help and Fright Night in fiscal 2011. As part of the agreement, the Company provides certain financing, which as of October 1, 2011, totaled $153 million. There is an additional $90 million available that is largely dependent on DreamWorks obtaining additional equity financing. Prior to the Companys acquisition, Marvel had agreements in place for third party studios to distribute its films including Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk , which have all been released. Under these arrangements, the Company incurs the cost to produce the films and pays the third party studio a distribution fee. Beginning with The Avengers , which is scheduled for release in May 2012, the Company will distribute all Marvel produced films. In fiscal 2011, the Company purchased the distribution rights for The  Avengers and Iron Man 3 from a third  party studio and will pay certain fees to that studio associated with the performance of those films, subject to a minimum guarantee. The Company has also licensed the rights to produce and distribute feature films for certain other Marvel properties including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and X-Men to third-party studios. Under these licensing arrangements, the third-party studio incurs the cost to produce and distribute the films and pays the Company a licensing fee. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company completed a two-way transaction to simplify our relationship with Sony Pictures. In this transaction, the Company purchased Sony Pictures participation in Spider-Man merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from the Company our participation in Spider-Man films. This transaction will allow the Company to control and fully benefit from all Spider-Man merchandising activity, while Sony Pictures will continue to produce and distribute Spider-Man films. On December 3, 2010, the Company sold Miramax Film NY, LLC (Miramax), which was one of its banners, for $663 million. Net proceeds which reflect closing adjustments, the settlement of related claims and obligations and Miramaxs cash balances at closing totaled $532 million. The sale included both Miramax and Dimension film assets.   Theatrical Market We generally produce and distribute live-action family films and full length animated films. During fiscal 2012, we expect to distribute domestically seven of our own produced feature films and four DreamWorks films. As of October 1, 2011, the Company had released domestically approximately 970 full-length live-action features, 90 full-length animated features, 550 cartoon shorts and 50 live action shorts. We distribute and market our filmed products principally through our own distribution and marketing companies in the U.S. theatrical market. In the international theatrical markets, we distribute our filmed products both directly and through independent distribution companies or joint ventures. Films released theatrically in the U.S. may be released simultaneously in international territories or generally up to four months later. The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the publics intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film. Home Entertainment Market In the domestic market, we distribute home entertainment releases directly under each of our motion picture banners. In the international market, we distribute home entertainment releases under each of our motion picture banners both directly and through independent foreign distribution companies. In addition, we acquire and produce original content for direct-to-video release. Domestic and international home entertainment distribution typically starts three to six months after the theatrical release in each market. The home entertainment releases may be distributed in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) and electronic versions. Most titles are sold simultaneously to retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy, and also Redbox and Netflix. As of October 1, 2011, we had approximately 1,700 active produced and acquired titles, including 1,300 live-action titles and 400 animated titles, in the domestic home entertainment marketplace and approximately 2,900 active produced and acquired titles, including 2,400 live-action titles and 500 animated titles, in the international marketplace. Television Market Pay-Per-View (PPV)/Video-on-Demand (VOD): Concurrently with, or up to two months after, home entertainment distribution begins, we license titles for use on a PPV/VOD basis, as well as for internet, console games, and mobile platforms. PPV/VOD services deliver one-time rentals electronically to consumers at a price comparable to that of physical media rentals. Pay Television (Pay 1): There are generally two pay television windows. The first window is generally sixteen months in duration and follows the PPV/VOD window. The Company has licensed exclusive domestic pay television rights to substantially all films released under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar, and Touchstone Pictures banners to the Starz pay television service through fiscal 2016. DreamWorks titles distributed by the Company are licensed to Showtime under a separate agreement. Free Television (Free 1): The Pay 1 window is followed by a television window with telecasts accessible to consumers without charge. This free window may last up to 84 months. Motion pictures are usually sold in the Free 1 window on an ad-hoc basis to major networks, including the ABC Television Network, and basic cable services. Pay Television 2 (Pay 2) and Free Television 2 (Free 2): In the U.S., Free 1 is generally followed by a fourteen-month Pay 2 window under our license arrangements with Starz and Showtime, and finally by a Free 2 window. Major packages of the Companys feature films have been licensed for broadcast under multi-year agreements within the Free 2 window. The Free 2 window is a syndication window where films are licensed both to basic cable networks and to third-party television station groups. International Television: The Company also licenses its theatrical properties outside of the U.S. The typical windowing sequence is broadly consistent with the domestic cycle such that titles premiere on television in PPV/VOD then air in pay TV before airing in free TV. Windowing strategies are developed in response to local market practices and conditions, and the exact sequence and length of each window can vary country by country.  Disney Music Group The Disney Music Group includes Walt Disney Records, Hollywood Records (including the Mammoth Records and Buena Vista Records labels), Lyric Street Records, Buena Vista Concerts and Disney Music Publishing. Walt Disney Records produces and distributes compact discs and music DVDs in the United States and licenses our music properties throughout the rest of the world. Music categories include infant, childrens read-along, teens, all-family and soundtracks from film and television series distributed by Walt Disney Pictures and Disney Channel. Hollywood Records develops, produces and markets recordings from talent across a spectrum of popular music. The Music Group commissions new music for the Companys motion picture and television programs, records the songs and licenses the song copyrights to others for printed music, records, audio-visual devices, public performances and digital distribution. Buena Vista Concerts produces live-entertainment events with artists signed to the Disney Music Group record labels. Disney Music Publishing controls the copyrights of thousands of musical compositions derived from the Companys motion picture, television, record and theme park properties, as well as musical compositions written by songwriters under exclusive contract. It is responsible for the management, protection, and licensing of the Disney song catalog on a worldwide basis. Disney Theatrical Productions Disney Theatrical Productions develops, produces and licenses live entertainment events. The Company has produced and licensed Broadway musicals around the world, including Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King , Elton John  Tim Rices Aida , Mary Poppins (a co-production with Cameron Mackintosh Ltd), and TARZAN  . Other stage musical ventures have included an Off-Broadway production of Peter and the Starcatcher and, most recently, stage adaptations of the films Aladdin and Newsies. In addition, the Company licenses musicals for local school and community theatre productions. Disney Theatrical Productions also delivers live shows globally through its license to Feld Entertainment, producer of Disney On Ice and Disney Live!. Disney On Ice s newest ice shows, Dare to Dream and Treasure Trove, launched in September and October 2011, respectively, for North America tours and Phineas and Ferb: The Greatest Live Tour Ever , the latest from Disney Live!, was launched in August 2011. Competition and Seasonality The Studio Entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television programming services and sponsor live theater. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, advertiser support and broadcast rights that are essential to the success of our Studio Entertainment businesses. The success of Studio Entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, Studio Entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. CONSUMER PRODUCTS The Consumer Products segment engages with licensees, manufacturers, publishers and retailers throughout the world to design, develop, publish, promote and sell a wide variety of products based on existing and new characters and other Company intellectual property through its Merchandise Licensing, Publishing and Retail businesses. In addition to leveraging the Companys film and television properties, Consumer Products also develops new intellectual property with the potential of also being used in the Companys other businesses and operates an English language learning business (Disney English).  Merchandise Licensing The Companys worldwide merchandise licensing operations include a diverse range of product categories, the most significant of which are: toys, apparel, home dcor and furnishings, stationery, accessories, health and beauty, food, footwear, and consumer electronics. The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include Mickey Mouse, Cars, Disney Princess, Winnie the Pooh, Toy Story, Disney Fairies, and the Marvel properties including Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man . The Company also designs individual products and creates exclusive themed and seasonal promotional campaigns for retailers based on characters, movies and TV shows. Publishing Disney Publishing Worldwide (DPW) publishes childrens books and magazines in multiple countries and languages. DPW businesses include: Juvenile Publishing, Digital Publishing, and Disney English. The Juvenile Publishing group creates, distributes and licenses childrens books and magazines globally in support of the Companys Disney-, Pixar- and Marvel-branded franchises. Digital Publishing offers content on digital devices through its growing library of e-books and apps, including apps such as Disney Princess Dress-Up: My Sticker Book and Cars 2: World Grand Prix Read and Race. Disney English operates 28 English language learning centers across China. Marvel Publishing creates and publishes comic books, and graphic novel collections of comic books, principally in North America. Marvel Publishing also licenses the right to publish translated versions of our comic books, principally in Europe and Latin America. Titles include X-Men , Spider-man , Captain America , Iron Man , Thor , The Avengers and the Incredible Hulk . Marvel Publishing also generates revenues from the digital distribution of its comic books. Retail The Company markets Disney-themed products directly through retail stores operated under the Disney Store name and through internet sites in North America (DisneyStore.com and DisneyOutlet.com), Western Europe, and Japan. The stores, which are generally located in leading shopping malls and other retail complexes, carry a wide variety of Disney merchandise and promote other businesses of the Company. The Company currently owns and operates 208 stores in North America, 103 stores in Europe, and 46 stores in Japan. Competition and Seasonality The Companys merchandise licensing, publishing and retail businesses compete with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. Based on independent surveys, we believe the Company is the largest worldwide licensor of character-based merchandise based on retail sales. Operating results for the licensing and retail businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of animated theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. INTERACTIVE MEDIA The Interactive Media Group creates and delivers branded entertainment and lifestyle content across interactive media platforms. The primary operating businesses of the Interactive Media Group are Games which produces multi-platform games for global distribution, and Online, which produces internet websites in the United States and internationally. The Interactive Media Group derives revenues from a combination of wholesale sales, licensing, advertising, sponsorships, subscription services and online game accessories (micro transactions). The Interactive Media Group also manages the Companys Disney-branded mobile phone business in Japan which provides mobile phone service and content to consumers. Games The Games business creates, develops, markets and distributes console and handheld, games worldwide based on properties created elsewhere in the Company, including 2011 titles such as LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean , and Cars 2 , as well as new game properties such as Epic Mickey. The Games business also produces online games, such as Disneys Club Penguin and Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow, interactive games for social networking websites such as Gardens of Time, and games for smartphone platforms. Certain properties are also licensed to third-party video game publishers. On August 27, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of Playdom, Inc., a company that develops and publishes online games for social networking websites.  Online Online develops, publishes and distributes content for branded online services intended for family entertainment. Disney Online produces kids and family-targeted entertainment through a portfolio of websites including Disney.com and the Disney Family Network. Disney.com integrates many of the Companys Disney-branded internet sites including sites for the Disney Channel, Disney Parks and Resorts, Walt Disney Pictures and Disney Consumer Products. Competition and Seasonality The Companys online sites and products compete with a wide variety of other online sites and products. The Companys video game business competes primarily with other publishers of video game software and other types of home entertainment. Operating results for the video game business fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of the Companys online and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The Companys businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important intellectual property includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of intellectual property rights are set forth in Item 1A  Risk Factors. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC. We are providing the address to our internet site solely for the information of investors. We do not intend the address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this report. ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. A decline in economic activity in the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. The most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that MVSPs pay for our cable programming. Recent instability in European economies presents risks of similar impacts in our European operations. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-United States markets, or reduce the United States dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets.  Changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. Our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the United States, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the United States. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. The media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. For example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including DVD players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings. In addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and delivery vehicles which may include options we have not yet fully developed, or options we have developed but which entail a smaller return than we realize on traditional options. As a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the United States and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. New technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. There is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Companys operations worldwide, despite the Companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other products. With respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our rights in intellectual property by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. The Company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations.   Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the United States, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. For example, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in Japan, including Tokyo Disney Resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. In addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. As changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included investments in new cruise ships, expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions, and development of a resort facility in Hawaii. In addition, a joint venture in which we participate recently began construction of a theme park in Shanghai, China. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.  Turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, equity markets have recently experienced rapid and wide fluctuations in value. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. We face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. We also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. For example: ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. ##TABLE_END Competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. Competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services.  Sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. With approximately 156,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macro-economic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and post retirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and post retirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. We enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to MVSPs. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. Our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of United States and overseas regulations. These regulations include: ##TABLE_START    United States FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. See Item 1  Business  Media Networks, Federal Regulation. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Environmental protection regulations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. ##TABLE_END Changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. Our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. Our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than United States law. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under United States law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-United States jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if United States law governed these operations.  Labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. A significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. In addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. In general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. The issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. In addition, provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. The seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. Each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Media Networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Studio Entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Consumer Products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Interactive Media segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. ##TABLE_END Accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.

Legal Proceedings Celador International Ltd. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. On May 19, 2004, an affiliate of the creator and licensor of the television program, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, filed an action against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and Buena Vista Television, LLC, alleging it was damaged by defendants improperly engaging in certain intra-company transactions and charging merchandise distribution expenses, resulting in an underpayment to the plaintiff. On July 7, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for breach of contract against certain subsidiaries of the Company, awarding plaintiff damages of $269.4 million. The Company has stipulated with the plaintiff to an award of prejudgment interest of $50 million, which amount will be reduced pro rata should the Court of Appeals reduce the damages amount. On December 21, 2010, the Companys alternative motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law were denied. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes the jurys verdict is in error and is vigorously pursuing its position on appeal, notice of which was filed by the Company on January 14, 2011. On or about January 28, 2011, plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal. The Company has determined that it does not have a probable loss under the applicable accounting standard relating to probability of loss for recording a reserve with respect to this litigation and therefore has not recorded a reserve. The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or codefendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not expect the Company to suffer any material liability by reason of these actions.

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains from the sales of businesses of $75 million. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items. ##TABLE_START   Benefit / (Expense)    Pretax   Tax Effect   After Tax  Restructuring and impairment charges  $ (55)   $ 47   $ (8)  Gains on sales of businesses   75    (107)    (32)         $ 20   $ (60)   $ (40)        ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges include an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million. These items collectively had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to the items in fiscal 2010 that are discussed below which had a net adverse impact of $0.04 on EPS. The increase in EPS for fiscal 2011 reflected higher operating results driven by higher revenues from MVSPs (Affiliate Fees) at our Cable Networks, increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN, lower film cost write-downs, decreased programming and production costs at the ABC Television Network, higher licensing revenue due to the strength of Cars merchandise and a full-period of results for Marvel, and higher equity income at AETN/Lifetime. These increases were partially offset by higher costs at ESPN and at our domestic parks and resorts, lower performance at our theatrical business, and the inclusion of a full-period of results for Playdom in the current year, which included the impact of acquisition accounting.  2010 vs. 2009 Revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 5%, or $1.9 billion, to $38.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 20%, or $656 million, to $4.0 billion; and EPS increased 15% to $2.03. Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2010 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.09 per diluted share), gains on the sales of investments in two television services in Europe ($0.02 per diluted share), a gain on the sale of the Power Rangers property ($0.01 per diluted share), and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan ($0.01 per diluted share), which, including the impact of rounding, collectively had a net adverse impact of $0.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.17 per diluted share), a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and AETN ($0.08 per diluted share) and a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($0.04 per diluted share). Including the impact of rounding, these items collectively resulted in a net adverse impact of $0.06 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 results also include an additional week of operations due to our fiscal period end. The increase in EPS for fiscal 2010 reflected higher operating results due to higher Affiliate Fees at our Cable Networks, increased advertising revenues at our cable and broadcast businesses, the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 , and lower distribution and marketing costs at our home entertainment business, partially offset by higher costs at our cable business and at our domestic parks and resorts operations. Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $55 million of charges in fiscal 2011 reflecting severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at the Studio Entertainment and Interactive Media segments. The Company recorded $270 million of charges in fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. The Company recorded charges totaling $492 million in fiscal 2009 which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and $65 million related to our investment in UTV. The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result of organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses. Other Income Other income is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009  Gain on sale of Miramax  $ 64   $    $   Gain on sale of BASS   11          Gain on sales of investments in television services in Europe       75      Gain on sale of Power Rangers property       43      Gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan       22      Gain on AETN/Lifetime transaction (1)           228  Gain on sale of investment in two pay television services in Latin America           114        Other income  $ 75   $ 140   $ 342        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  On September 15, 2009, the Company and the Hearst Corporation both contributed their 50% interest in Lifetime to AETN in exchange for an increased interest in AETN. The transaction resulted in a $228 million non-cash gain. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of this transaction. ##TABLE_END  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2011 vs. 2010 Below is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $471 million at Cable Networks from $3,051 million to $3,522 million and an increase of $99 million at Broadcasting from $3,977 million to $4,076 million. The increase at Cable Networks of 14% was due to higher rates. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 6% due to higher Network advertising rates, primarily at primetime, and 1% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 4% due to lower Network ratings primarily at primetime and daytime. The increase in other revenues was driven by a change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher sales of Disney Channel programming, partially offset by lower sales of ABC Studios productions driven by no new seasons of Lost and Ghost Whisperer . Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $249 million from $8,453 million to $8,702 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production spending of $457 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to the addition of college football programming including Bowl Championship Series games, increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming and more episodes of original programming at the Disney Channels, partially offset by the absence of programming costs for the FIFA World Cup which was broadcast in the prior year. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $208 million reflecting lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives, a lower cost mix of programming in primetime due to a shift of hours from original scripted programming to reality programming, a shift of college sports programming to ESPN and lower production cost amortization due to a decrease in sales of ABC Studios productions. Operating expenses also reflected a 2% increase due to a change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and a 1% increase due to higher labor costs at ESPN due to headcount growth and labor cost inflation. The increase in selling, general and administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing and sales costs, which included an increase due to the change in transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher marketing costs at ESPN. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees increased to $584 million in the current year from $438 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN/Lifetime primarily due to the absence of a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in the prior year and higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher marketing costs.  Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 20%, or $1.0 billion, to $6.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the ABC Television Network, the worldwide Disney Channels, our AETN/Lifetime joint venture and the owned television stations. The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Cable Networks  $ 12,877   $ 11,475    12 %  Broadcasting   5,837    5,687    3 %        $ 18,714   $ 17,162    9 %       Segment operating income    Cable Networks  $ 5,233   $ 4,473    17 %  Broadcasting   913    659    39 %        $ 6,146   $ 5,132    20 %       ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges of $3 million, $95 million and $315 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. The charges in fiscal 2009 were primarily due to $142 million of radio FCC license impairments, a $65 million impairment charge related to our investment in UTV and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Parks and Resorts Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Domestic  $ 9,302   $ 8,404    11 %  International   2,495    2,357    6 %       Total revenues   11,797    10,761    10 %  Operating expenses   (7,383)    (6,787)    (9) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (1,696)    (1,517)    (12) %  Depreciation and amortization   (1,165)    (1,139)    (2) %       Operating Income  $ 1,553   $ 1,318    18 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1 billion, to $11.8 billion due to an increase of $898 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $138 million at our international operations. Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 6% increase driven by higher average guest spending and a 3% increase due to volume driven by higher passenger cruise ship days due to the launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , in January 2011, and higher attendance. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates, and food, beverage, and merchandise spending. Revenue growth of 6% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase due to higher average guest spending, a 3% increase driven by volume due to higher attendance and hotel occupancy, and a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease due to the prior-year sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris and a 1% decrease due to the temporary closure of the Tokyo Disney Resort following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.  The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: ##TABLE_START   Domestic   International (2)   Total    Fiscal Year 2011   Fiscal Year 2010   Fiscal Year 2011   Fiscal Year 2010   Fiscal Year 2011   Fiscal Year 2010  Parks       Increase/ (decrease)       Attendance   1 %    (1) %    6 %    1 %    2 %    (1) %  Per Capita Guest Spending   8 %    3 %    5 %    3 %    7 %    3 %  Hotels (1)       Occupancy   82 %    82%    88 %    85 %    83 %    82 %  Available Room Nights (in thousands)   9,625    9,629    2,466    2,466    12,091    12,095  Per Room Guest Spending  $ 241   $ 224   $ 294   $ 273   $ 253   $ 234  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending include the impact of foreign currency translation. Guest spending statistics for Disneyland Paris were converted from Euros into US Dollars at weighted average exchange rates of 1.39 and 1.36 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor which increased by $262 million from $3,278 million to $3,540 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. Operating expenses also include cost of sales which increased $88 million from $1,110 million to $1,198 million driven by volume, partially offset by the absence of the costs related to a prior-year real estate sale at Disneyland Paris. Operating expenses also increased due to launch and operating costs in connection with the Disney Dream , enhancement and expansion costs, including new guest offerings at Disney California Adventure and investments in our systems infrastructure, and costs for Aulani, our new hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii. In addition there was an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing costs at our domestic parks and resorts, costs associated with the additional cruise ship and our new resort in Hawaii, and labor cost inflation. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 18%, or $235 million, to $1.6 billion due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by costs for our new resort in Hawaii and a decrease at Tokyo Disney Resort. Studio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Theatrical distribution  $ 1,733   $ 2,050    (15) %  Home entertainment   2,435    2,666    (9) %  Television distribution and other   2,183    1,985    10 %       Total revenues   6,351    6,701    (5) %  Operating expenses   (3,136)    (3,469)    10 %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,465)    (2,450)    (1) %  Depreciation and amortization   (132)    (89)    (48) %  Equity in the income of investees            %       Operating Income  $ 618   $ 693    (11) %       ##TABLE_END  Revenues The decrease in theatrical distribution revenue reflected the prior-year success of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 compared to the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Cars 2, Thor and Captain America in the current year. Lower home entertainment revenue reflected an 11% decrease due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for Studio distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product, partially offset by a 1% increase due to higher net effective pricing internationally which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. The increase in television distribution and other revenues reflected 5% growth due to the inclusion of Marvel which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year and a 4% increase due to higher revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. Cost and Expenses Operating expenses included a decrease of $262 million in film cost amortization, from $2,142 million to $1,880 million, driven by lower film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include cost of sales and distribution expenses which decreased $71 million from $1,327 million to $1,256 million primarily due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product. Selling, general, administrative and other costs were essentially flat as higher marketing for Marvel titles and an increase in technology infrastructure spending were largely offset by lower theatrical pre-release marketing expense and the change in the transfer pricing arrangement with Media Networks for home entertainment product. The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by higher amortization on intangible assets related to certain Marvel film properties. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 11%, or $75 million, to $618 million primarily due to lower results at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and higher technology infrastructure spending, partially offset by lower film cost write-downs and a higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges of $33 million, $151 million and $47 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2011 and 2009 were primarily for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2010 were primarily for the closure of a production facility, the write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned film projects, and severance costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Consumer Products Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Licensing and publishing  $ 1,933   $ 1,725    12 %  Retail and other   1,116    953    17 %       Total revenues   3,049    2,678    14 %  Operating expenses   (1,334)    (1,236)    (8) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (794)    (687)    (16) %  Depreciation and amortization   (105)    (78)    (35) %  Equity in the income of investees            %       Operating Income  $ 816   $ 677    21 %       ##TABLE_END  Revenues The increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a 6% increase driven by the strong performance of Cars, Tangled and Toy Story merchandise and a 8% increase due to higher revenue from Marvel properties. Higher revenues from Marvel properties reflected the impact of acquisition accounting which reduced revenue recognition in the prior year as well as a full year of operations as Marvel was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease due to a higher revenue share to the Studio Entertainment segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. The increase in retail and other revenues was primarily due to a 9% increase from higher revenues at the Disney Store in North America and Europe driven by higher comparable store sales and a 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan, which was acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Licensing and publishing and retail and other revenues also increased by 2% and 3%, respectively, due to the benefit from a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase of $57 million in cost of goods sold, from $521 million to $578 million, driven by the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. Operating expenses also included a 2% increase due to higher occupancy costs driven by an increase at our retail business reflecting the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and a 1% increase due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro; the inclusion of a full year of operations for Marvel and various promotional initiatives across multiple businesses. The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets for Marvel and an increase at the Disney Stores due to an increase in new stores and remodels. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 21%, or $139 million, to $816 million primarily due to increases in our Merchandise Licensing and North American retail businesses. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $16 million and $19 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were for severance and related costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interactive Media Operating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Game sales and subscriptions  $ 768   $ 563    36 %  Advertising and other   214    198    8 %       Total revenues   982    761    29 %  Operating expenses   (732)    (581)    (26) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (504)    (371)    (36) %  Depreciation and amortization   (54)    (43)    (26) %  Equity in the income of investees            %       Operating Loss  $ (308)   $ (234)    (32) %       ##TABLE_END  Revenues Game sales and subscriptions revenue growth reflected a 12% increase due to higher console game unit sales and a 10% increase due to higher net effective pricing of console games, reflecting the strong performance of Epic Mickey and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and a shift in sales from catalog titles to new releases. Additionally, the inclusion of Playdom for a full year compared to one month in the prior year resulted in a 10% increase in game sales and subscription revenues. Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by our mobile phone service in Japan. Costs and Expenses Operating expense included a $60 million increase in product development expense from $335 million to $395 million primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year. Operating expenses also included a 12% increase due to higher cost of sales driven by fees paid to the developer of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and higher console game unit sales. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss was $308 million compared to $234 million in the prior year as an improvement at our console game business was more than offset by the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $22 million, $2 million and $42 million related to Interactive Media for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2009 were for goodwill impairment and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2011 vs. 2010 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 9%, from $420 million to $459 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses and compensation related costs. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   % Change Better/(Worse)  Interest expense   $ (435)    $ (456)    5 % Interest and investment income   92    47    96 %      Net interest expense   $ (343)    $ (409)    16 %      ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense for the year reflected lower effective interest rates. The increase in interest and investment income for the year was driven by gains on sales of investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points from 34.9% in 2010 to 34.6% in 2011 as the absence of a charge related to the health care reform legislation and a benefit from an increase in the domestic production deduction rate were largely offset by a decrease in favorable resolutions of prior-year tax matters. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $72 million charge related to the enactment of health care reform legislation in March 2010. Under this legislation the Companys deductions for retiree prescription drug benefits will be reduced by the amount of Medicare Part D drug subsidies received beginning in fiscal year 2014. Under applicable accounting rules, the Company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset, which was established for the future deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefit costs, to reflect the lost deductions. The reduction was recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the legislation was enacted.  Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $101 million to $451 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $576 million, $482 million, and $214 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. We expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $50 million to $626 million in fiscal 2012 driven by a lower assumed discount rate, partially offset by a favorable impact due to plan amendments. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $4.2 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) as of October 1, 2011. If our investment performance does not improve relative to our long-term assumption and/or discount rates do not increase, we expect that pension and postretirement medical costs will continue at levels comparable to fiscal 2012 for the next few years as a result of amortizing these unrecognized expenses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements and amendments we made to our plans in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, the Company contributed $935 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2012 to total approximately $325 million to $375 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2012 will be determined based on our January 1, 2012 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2012. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs. BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2010 vs. 2009 Media Networks Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Affiliate Fees  $ 8,082   $ 7,407    9 %  Advertising   7,028    6,566    7 %  Other   2,052    2,236    (8) %       Total revenues   17,162    16,209    6 %  Operating expenses   (9,888)    (9,464)    (4) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,358)    (2,341)    (1) %  Depreciation and amortization   (222)    (206)    (8) %  Equity in the income of investees   438    567    (23) %       Operating Income  $ 5,132   $ 4,765    8 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues The 9% increase in Affiliate Fees, which are generally derived from fees charged on a per-subscriber basis, was primarily due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at Cable Networks which resulted in revenue increases of 5% and 4%, respectively, partially offset by the impact of one fewer week of operations.  Higher advertising revenues were due to increases of $362 million at Cable Networks from $2,689 million to $3,051 million and of $100 million at Broadcasting from $3,877 million to $3,977 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 9% due to higher sold inventory. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 4% due to higher network advertising rates and sold inventory and 3% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a 4% decrease due to lower network ratings and one fewer week of operations. Other revenues decreased $94 million at Cable Networks and $90 million at Broadcasting. The decrease at Cable Networks was driven by the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected lower domestic television syndication revenues due to the sales of According to Jim and Greys Anatomy in fiscal 2009. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include an increase in programming and production costs of $377 million from $8,076 million to $8,453 million. At Cable Networks an increase in programming and production costs of $446 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to new international sports programming rights and increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming. At Broadcasting a decrease in programming and production costs of $69 million was driven by costs savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in primetime. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher pension and postretirement medical and compensation related costs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $60 million due to the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer in fiscal 2009 and a decrease due to the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees decreased to $438 million in fiscal 2010 from $567 million in fiscal 2009 driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in fiscal 2010. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 8%, or $367 million, to $5.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the owned television stations and the international Disney Channels, partially offset by lower equity income. The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Cable Networks  $ 11,475   $ 10,555    9 %  Broadcasting   5,687    5,654    1 %        $ 17,162   $ 16,209    6 %       Segment operating income    Cable Networks  $ 4,473   $ 4,260    5 %  Broadcasting   659    505    30 %        $ 5,132   $ 4,765    8 %       ##TABLE_END  Parks and Resorts Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Domestic  $ 8,404   $ 8,442     %  International   2,357    2,225    6 %       Total revenues   10,761    10,667    1 %  Operating expenses   (6,787)    (6,634)    (2) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (1,517)    (1,467)    (3) %  Depreciation and amortization   (1,139)    (1,148)    1 %       Operating Income  $ 1,318   $ 1,418    (7) %       ##TABLE_END Revenues Parks and Resorts revenues increased 1%, or $94 million, to $10.8 billion due to an increase of $132 million at our international operations, partially offset by a decrease of $38 million at our domestic operations. The decline in revenue at our domestic operations reflected the impact of one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2010 and a 1% volume decrease reflecting lower vacation club ownership sales, lower hotel occupancy and lower passenger cruise ship days. These decreases were partially offset by higher guest spending primarily due to higher average ticket prices and higher average daily hotel room rates. The 6% revenue increase at our international operations reflected increases of 3% due to higher guest spending and 3% due to the sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris as well as higher attendance and hotel occupancy. Higher guest spending was driven by higher average ticket prices and average daily hotel room rates. The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: ##TABLE_START   Domestic   International (2)   Total    Fiscal Year 2010   Fiscal Year 2009   Fiscal Year 2010   Fiscal Year 2009   Fiscal Year 2010   Fiscal Year 2009  Parks       Increase/ (decrease)       Attendance   (1) %    2 %    1 %    1 %    (1) %    2 %  Per Capita Guest Spending   3 %    (6) %    3 %    (12) %    3 %    (7) %  Hotels (1)       Occupancy   82 %    87 %    85 %    85 %    82 %    86 %  Available Room Nights (in thousands)   9,629    9,549    2,466    2,473    12,095    12,022  Per Room Guest Spending   $ 224    $ 214    $ 273    $ 261    $ 234    $ 223  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending include the impact of foreign currency translation. Guest spending statistics for Disneyland Paris were converted from Euros into US Dollars at weighted average exchange rates of 1.36 and 1.35 for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase in operating labor of $173 million from $3,105 million to $3,278 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses, partially offset by a decrease in costs of sales of $57 million from $1,167 million to $1,110 million primarily due to decreased sales volume. In addition, operating expenses reflected increased costs for new guest offerings including World of Color at Disneyland Resort. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by increased marketing costs in support of the Disney Cruise Line fleet expansion and also World of Color at Disneyland Resort as well as labor cost inflation.  Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 7%, or $100 million, to $1.3 billion, due to a decrease at our domestic operations, partially offset by an improvement at our international operations. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $54 million related to Parks and Resorts in fiscal 2009 for severance and related costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Studio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Theatrical distribution   $ 2,050    $ 1,325    55 %  Home entertainment   2,666    2,762    (3) %  Television distribution and other   1,985    2,049    (3) %       Total revenues   6,701    6,136    9 %  Operating expenses   (3,469)    (3,210)    (8) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,450)    (2,687)    9 %  Depreciation and amortization   (89)    (60)    (48) %  Equity in the income of investees       (4)    nm       Operating Income   $ 693    $ 175    nm       ##TABLE_END Revenues The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the strong performance of Toy Story 3 , Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in fiscal 2010, compared to Up and The Proposal in fiscal 2009. The decrease in home entertainment revenues was primarily due to a 2% decrease reflecting lower net effective pricing and a 2% decrease driven by lower sales volume of new releases domestically. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. The decrease in television distribution and other revenues reflected the strong performance of High School Musical 3 and Rascal Flatts CD titles in fiscal 2009 as well as the Cheetah Girls concert tour in fiscal 2009. Cost and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase in film cost amortization of $385 million from $1,757 million to $2,142 million driven by the strong performance of our key theatrical releases and higher film cost write-downs, partially offset by a decrease in costs of goods sold of $35 million from $384 million to $349 million driven by cost reduction initiatives at our home entertainment business. Selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses reflected a decrease in marketing costs at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased from $175 million to $693 million primarily due to the improvements in our theatrical and home entertainment businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs.  Consumer Products Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Licensing and publishing   $ 1,725    $ 1,584    9 %  Retail and other   953    841    13 %       Total revenues   2,678    2,425    10 %  Operating expenses   (1,236)    (1,182)    (5) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (687)    (597)    (15) %  Depreciation and amortization   (78)    (39)    nm  Equity in the income of investees       2    nm       Operating Income   $ 677    $ 609    11 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues The increase in licensing and publishing revenue was primarily due to an increase of $221 million resulting from the acquisition of Marvel and the strong performance of Toy Story merchandise, partially offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio Entertainment segment of $90 million. Higher retail and other revenues were driven by a $69 million increase due to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and an increase of $33 million at The Disney Store North America and Europe reflecting higher comparable store sales. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included cost of goods sold of $521 million which was comparable to fiscal 2009 as increases due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel were offset by lower third-party royalties on licensing revenues and decreased costs of sales at The Disney Store North America due to an improved global purchasing strategy. Other operating costs increased due to the addition of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other was driven by the acquisitions of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 11%, or $68 million, to $677 million due to improved results at our retail business and an increase in our publishing business driven by Marvel titles. Interactive Media Operating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 2, 2010   October 3, 2009   Revenues    Game sales and subscriptions  $ 563   $ 565     %  Advertising and other   198    147    35 %       Total revenues   761    712    7 %  Operating expenses   (581)    (623)    7 %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (371)    (336)    (10) %  Depreciation and amortization   (43)    (50)    14 %  Equity in the income of investees       2    nm       Operating Loss  $ (234)   $ (295)    21 %       ##TABLE_END  Revenues Game sales and subscription revenue was essentially flat as lower unit sales of self published console games were offset by higher subscription revenues at Club Penguin. Significant titles in fiscal 2010 included Toy Story 3, Split Second and Sing It 2 while fiscal 2009 included High School Musical 3, Sing It and Bolt. Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by increases at our mobile phone service business in Japan and in online advertising. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included a decrease in costs of goods sold of $70 million from $266 million to $196 million due to lower video game costs reflecting a sales mix shift from higher cost new releases, which included bundled accessories, in fiscal 2009 to lower cost catalog titles in fiscal 2010. This decrease was partially offset by increased product development expense of $24 million. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected higher marketing costs driven by Toy Story 3 and Split Second . Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss decreased 21%, or $61 million, to $234 million driven by improved results at our games and Japan mobile phone service businesses, partially offset by the impact of purchase accounting for Playdom. NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2010 vs. 2009 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 6%, from $398 million to $420 million, primarily due to higher information technology and compensation costs. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010   2009   % Change Better/(Worse)  Interest expense  $ (456)   $ (588)    22 %  Interest and investment income   47    122    (61)%       Net interest expense  $ (409)   $ (466)    12 %       ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing borrowing. The decrease in interest and investment income for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior year, lower effective interest rates and lower average cash balances. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points from 36.2% in 2009 to 34.9% in 2010. The lower effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, partially offset by a $72 million charge related to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $48 million to $350 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and ESPN. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined based on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   2009  Cash provided by operations  $ 6,994   $ 6,578   $ 5,319  Cash used by investing activities   (3,286)    (4,523)    (1,755)  Cash used by financing activities   (3,233)    (2,663)    (3,111)  Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents   (12)    (87)    (37)        Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ 463   $ (695)   $ 416        ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 increased 6% or $416 million to $7.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products and Interactive Media businesses, partially offset by lower revenues at our Studio Entertainment business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments at Corporate and at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive Media, and Consumer Products businesses, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments at our Studio Entertainment business. The increase in cash payments at Corporate was driven by higher contributions to our pension plans, while the increase at Media Networks was primarily due to higher investment in television programming and production. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher promotional and operating costs from the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , and higher marketing and sales expenses and expansion costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. The increase in cash payments at Interactive Media reflects the inclusion of Playdom, while the increase in cash payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. The decrease in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower film production spending. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 increased 24% or $1.3 billion to $6.6 billion as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was driven by higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our Studio Entertainment segment driven by a decrease in distribution and marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The increase in cash receipts at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of advance travel deposits. Depreciation expense is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   2009  Media Networks    Cable Networks  $ 134   $ 118   $ 108  Broadcasting   95    95    89        Total Media Networks   229    213    197        Parks and Resorts    Domestic   842    807    822  International   323    332    326        Total Parks and Resorts   1,165    1,139    1,148        Studio Entertainment   53    56    50  Consumer Products   48    33    29  Interactive Media   16    19    28  Corporate   148    142    128        Total depreciation expense  $ 1,659   $ 1,602   $ 1,580        ##TABLE_END The Companys Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.  The Companys film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   2009  Beginning balances:    Production and programming assets  $ 5,451   $ 5,756   $ 5,935  Programming liabilities   (990)    (1,193)    (1,108)          4,461    4,563    4,827        Spending:    Film and television production   3,184    3,370    3,421  Broadcast programming   4,588    4,316    3,896          7,772    7,686    7,317        Amortization:    Film and television production   (3,521)    (3,593)    (3,486)  Broadcast programming   (4,583)    (4,331)    (3,788)          (8,104)    (7,924)    (7,274)        Change in film and television production and programming costs   (332)    (238)    43        Other non-cash activity   36    136    (154)  Ending balances:    Production and programming assets   5,031    5,451    5,756  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Programming liabilities   (866)    (990)    (1,040)         $ 4,165   $ 4,461   $ 4,716        ##TABLE_END Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts, and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property for the last three years are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   2009  Media Networks    Cable Networks  $ 179   $ 132   $ 151  Broadcasting   128    92    143  Parks and Resorts    Domestic   2,294    1,295    1,039  International   429    238    143  Studio Entertainment   118    102    135  Consumer Products   115    97    46  Interactive Media   21    17    21  Corporate   275    137    75         $ 3,559   $ 2,110   $ 1,753        ##TABLE_END Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, cruise ships, new rides and attractions, recurring capital and capital improvements. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2011 reflected the final payment on our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , theme park and resort expansions and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the development of Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 reflected higher construction progress payments on the two new cruise ships, the expansions at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disney California Adventure and the construction of Aulani, a Disney Resort  Spa in Hawaii. The increase in capital expenditures at Consumer Products from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 was driven by costs at the Disney Stores for new stores and remodels. Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities.  Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increases in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were driven by investments in equipment and corporate facilities. Other Investing Activities During fiscal 2011, proceeds from dispositions of $564 million primarily due to the sale of Miramax, were partially offset by acquisitions totaling $184 million which included additional payments related to the acquisition of Playdom, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During fiscal 2010, acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc., and were partially offset by net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property. During fiscal 2009, acquisitions totaled $176 million and included the purchase of additional interests in UTV (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), offset by proceeds totaling $185 million from the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 increased by $570 million to $3.2 billion compared to fiscal 2010 and consisted of repurchases of common stock and the payment of dividends partially offset by borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The increase from fiscal 2010 was due to higher repurchases of common stock, partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 decreased by $448 million to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2009 and consisted of repurchases of common stock, repayments of borrowings, and the payment of dividends partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The decrease from fiscal 2009 was due to lower repayments of borrowings and increased proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by higher share repurchases. During the year ended October 1, 2011, the Companys borrowing activity was as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  October 2, 2010   Additions   Payments   Other Activity   October 1, 2011  Commercial paper borrowings  $ 1,190   $ 393   $    $    $ 1,583  U.S. medium-term notes   6,815    2,350    (750)    (15)    8,400  European medium-term notes   273        (168)    (14)    91  Other foreign currency denominated debt (1)   965            55    1,020  Other (2)   651        (37)    (42)    572  Disneyland Paris borrowings   2,113        (164)    32    1,981  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort borrowings ( 3 )   473            (143)    330            Total  $ 12,480   $ 2,743   $ (1,119)   $ (127)   $ 13,977            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 2 )  The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 3 )  The other activity is primarily due to the conversion of a portion of the HKSARs loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ##TABLE_END The Companys bank facilities are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Committed Capacity   Capacity Used   Unused Capacity  Bank facilities expiring February 2013  $ 2,250   $       $ 2,250  Bank facilities expiring February 2015   2,250    47    2,203        Total  $ 4,500   $ 47   $ 4,453        ##TABLE_END In February 2011, the Company entered into a new four-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders. This facility, in combination with the facility that matures in 2013, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. The new bank facility allows the Company to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of October 1, 2011, $315 million of letters of credit had been issued of which $47 million was issued under this facility. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.33% to 4.50%.  The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010. The Company paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009; and paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($648 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135 million shares of Disney common stock for $5.0 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80 million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of Disney common stock for $138 million. On March 22, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the amount of shares that can be repurchased to 400 million shares as of that date. As of October 1, 2011, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 305 million additional shares. We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See Item 1A  Risk Factors. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of October 1, 2011, Moodys Investors Services long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard  Poors long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitchs long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 1, 2011, by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default. Disneyland Paris has in its debt agreements certain annual financial performance objectives and limits on investing and financing activities. In fiscal 2011, Disneyland Paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and must defer 25 million of royalties and management fees payable to the Company and 20 million of interest payable to a French state bank. Additionally, as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met, certain of Disneyland Pariss investment activities are further limited by the debt agreements. Disneyland Paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and believes that it is in compliance with such covenants with the assistance of the Companys agreement, as permitted under the debt agreements, to defer an additional 9 million of royalties payable to the Company into subordinated long-term borrowings. The deferrals discussed above and compliance with these financial covenants are subject to final third-party review as provided in Disneyland Pariss debt agreements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at October 1, 2011 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: ##TABLE_START    Payments Due by Period  (in millions)  Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   4-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Borrowings (Note 9) (1)  $ 18,352   $ 3,442   $ 4,199   $ 2,198   $ 8,513  Operating lease commitments (Note 15)   2,227    502    738    395    592  Capital lease obligations (Note 15)   786    70    110    87    519  Sports programming commitments (Note 15)   33,287    3,465    7,623    6,354    15,845  Broadcast programming commitments (Note 15)   2,785    1,959    542    202    82            Total sports and other broadcast programming commitments   36,072    5,424    8,165    6,556    15,927  Other (2)   4,094    1,788    1,116    344    846            Total contractual obligations (3)  $ 61,531   $ 11,226   $ 14,328   $ 9,580   $ 26,397            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $284 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt, and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for the construction of two new cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports personnel, television and radio personalities and executives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Contractual commitments include the following: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  $ 15,674  Commitments not recorded on the balance sheet   45,857     $ 61,531    ##TABLE_END The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees The Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys contingent commitments and contractual guarantees. Legal and Tax Matters As disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Film and Television Revenues and Costs We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.  With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the programs rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. Revenue Recognition The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated. We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a four-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.  The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 4.75% at the end of fiscal 2011 from 5.25% at the end of fiscal 2010 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our October 1, 2011 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2012. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2012 by $223 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 1, 2011 by $1.9 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $193 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for both of the 2011 and 2010 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2012 annual benefit expense by approximately $70 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.  The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were immaterial. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $279 million, which included $142 million for FCC radio licenses and $65 million for our investment in UTV. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. These impairment charges, which were estimated using a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. Income Tax Audits As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if the company does not have a history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis or third-party evidence of selling price. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether an entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the VIE. The guidance on VIEs requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  Employee Compensation  Retirement Benefits In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A  Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. Policies and Procedures In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Companys portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.  Value at Risk (VAR) The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Companys computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at fiscal year end. The model includes all of the Companys debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. VAR on a combined basis increased to $58 million at October 1, 2011 from $33 million at October 2, 2010. The increase in VAR primarily reflected an increase in the amount of fixed rate debt during the year and higher volatility of interest rates. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2011  Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments   Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments   Equity Sensitive Financial Instruments   Combined Portfolio  Year end VAR   $34    $27    $7    $58  Average VAR   $24    $27    $4    $44  Highest VAR   $34    $34    $8    $58  Lowest VAR   $15    $20    $1    $32  Beginning of year VAR (year end fiscal 2010)   $19    $22    $1    $33  ##TABLE_END The VAR for Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is immaterial as of October 1, 2011 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.

Business The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive. For convenience, the terms Company and we are used to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted. Information on the Companys revenues, operating income, and identifiable assets appears in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. The Company employed approximately 166,000 people as of September 29, 2012.

Cable Networks Our cable networks include ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Family, and SOAPnet. We also operate the UTV/Bindass networks in India. The cable networks group produces its own programs or acquires rights from third-parties to air programs on our networks. The Company also has interests in joint ventures that operate cable and broadcast programming services and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cable networks derive a majority of their revenues from fees charged to cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (Multi-channel Video Programming Distributors or MVPDs) for the right to deliver our programming to their customers and, for certain networks (primarily ESPN and ABC Family), the sale to advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. Generally, the Companys cable networks operate under multi-year agreements with MVPDs that include contractually determined fees. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our cable network services are largely dependent on the competitive market and the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide. The ability to sell time for commercial announcements and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand. We also sell programming developed by our cable networks to third parties worldwide in pay and syndication markets, in DVD format and also online to third-party services.

Competition and Seasonality The Companys Media Networks businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks, independent television stations and other media, such as DVDs, video games and the internet. With respect to the sale of advertising time, our broadcasting operations, certain of our cable networks and our television and radio stations compete with other television networks and radio stations, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, billboards, and the internet. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for viewers in individual market areas. A television or radio station in one market generally does not compete directly with stations in other markets. The growth in the number of networks distributed by MVPDs has resulted in increased competitive pressures for advertising revenues for both our broadcasting and cable networks. The Companys cable networks also face competition from other cable networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Companys contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place. The Companys Media Networks businesses also compete for the acquisition of sports and other programming. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming. The Company currently has sports rights agreements with the NFL, college football and basketball conferences (including college football bowl games), NBA, NASCAR, MLB, World Cup and various soccer leagues, and golf and tennis associations. The Companys internet websites and digital products compete with other web sites and entertainment products in their respective categories. Advertising revenues at the Media Networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met. These commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period.  Federal Regulation Television and radio broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect our Media Networks segment include the following: ##TABLE_START    Licensing of television and radio stations. Each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (or the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. The FCC has delayed renewals for a number of broadcast licensees, including a number of our licenses, in recent years while permitting the licensees to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Television and radio station ownership limits. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. Currently: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any of the markets in which we own a television station. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience (for this purpose, FCC regulations attribute to UHF television stations only 50% of the television households in their market). For purposes of the FCCs rules, our eight stations reach approximately 21% of the national audience. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    FCC regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations, but we do not believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Dual networks. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major television networks  ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC  from being under common ownership or control. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of programming. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning indecent programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during childrens programming. Broadcasters face a heightened risk of being found in violation of the indecency prohibition by the FCC because of recent FCC decisions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. In the past several years, the FCC increased enforcement activities with respect to indecency. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming are a maximum of $325,000 per violation. ##TABLE_END Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast channels are generally required to provide a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has as a significant purpose meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. ##TABLE_START    Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. With respect to cable systems operating within a television stations Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either must carry status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the stations market, or retransmission consent status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. Under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and its successors, including most recently the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA), which also requires the must carry or retransmission consent election, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television stations signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. Under must carry, if a satellite carrier elects to carry one local station in a market, the satellite carrier must carry the signals of all local television stations that also request carriage. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Cable and satellite carriage of programming. The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations regarding cable and satellite retransmission consent, and some cable and satellite companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on cable and satellite systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could, depending on its specific nature, have an impact on the Companys operations. ##TABLE_END The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and other legislation and of specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCCs regulatory authority. FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

The expansion brings three new themed areas to Hong Kong Disneyland: Toy Story Land, which opened in November 2011; Grizzly Gulch, which opened in July 2012; and Mystic Point, which is currently scheduled to open in 2013. Pursuant to the plan, the Company converted a loan to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort into equity and made additional capital contributions of $332 million, and the HKSAR contributed like amounts of capital by converting a portion of its loan to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort into equity. This increased the Companys effective ownership interest from 43% to 48%. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Construction has commenced and we expect the total investment to be approximately 24.5 billion yuan to build the theme park and an additional 4.5 billion yuan to build other aspects of the resort, including the hotels and the retail, dining and entertainment area. The investment amounts will be funded in accordance with each partners equity ownership percentage. In addition, a joint venture management company, in which Disney has a 70% interest and Shendi a 30% interest, is responsible for creating, developing and operating the resort. The management company will be entitled to receive management fees based on operating performance of the resort. Shanghai Disney Resort will also pay the Company royalties based on resort revenues. Tokyo Disney Resort Tokyo Disney Resort is located on approximately 494 acres of land, six miles east of downtown Tokyo, Japan. The resort includes two theme parks (Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea); three Disney-branded hotels; six independently operated hotels; and a retail, dining and entertainment complex. Tokyo Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983, was the first Disney theme park to open outside the U.S. Tokyo Disneyland consists of seven principal themed areas: Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Toontown, Westernland and World Bazaar. Tokyo DisneySea  Tokyo DisneySea, adjacent to Tokyo Disneyland, opened in 2001.

Walt Disney Imagineering Walt Disney Imagineering provides master planning, real estate development, attraction, entertainment and show design, engineering support, production support, project management and other development services, including research and development for the Companys operations. Competition and Seasonality The Companys theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, and weather patterns and natural disasters. All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, the theme parks and resorts business experiences fluctuations in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.  STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT The Studio Entertainment segment produces and acquires live-action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video content, musical recordings and live stage plays. The Company distributes produced and acquired films (including its film and television library) in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets primarily under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar and Marvel banners. The Company produces and distributes Indian movies worldwide through its UTV banner. In August 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with DreamWorks Studios (DreamWorks) to distribute live-action motion pictures produced by DreamWorks for seven years under the Touchstone Pictures banner for which the Company receives a distribution fee. Under the agreement, the Company has distributed six films to date. As part of the agreement, the Company provided financing to DreamWorks, which as of September 29, 2012, totaled $154 million. There is an additional $90 million available to DreamWorks. Prior to the Companys acquisition of Marvel in 2010, Marvel had agreements in place for third-party studios to distribute its films including Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk , which have all been released. Under these arrangements, Marvel incurred the cost to produce the films and pays the third-party studio a distribution fee. In fiscal 2011, the Company purchased the distribution rights for Marvels The  Avengers and Iron Man 3 from a third - party studio and starting in fiscal 2012 we paid certain fees to that studio associated with the performance of those films, subject to a minimum guarantee. Beginning with Marvels The Avengers , which was released in May 2012, the Company distributes all Marvel produced films. Also prior to the Companys acquisition of Marvel in 2010, Marvel had licensed the rights to produce and distribute feature films for certain other Marvel properties including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and X-Men to third-party studios. Under these licensing arrangements, the third-party studio incurs the cost to produce and distribute the films and pays the Company a licensing fee. Generally under these arrangements, Marvel retains the merchandise licensing rights and pays the third-party studio a royalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company completed a two-way transaction to simplify the Spider-Man arrangement with Sony Pictures. In this transaction, the Company purchased Sony Pictures participation in Spider-Man merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from the Company our participation in Spider-Man films. This transaction will allow the Company to control and fully benefit from all Spider-Man merchandising activity, while Sony Pictures will continue to produce and distribute Spider-Man films. The Company holds a 99% interest in UTV, one of the leading film production studios and film distributors in India, which produces and co-produces live-action and animated content. In fiscal 2012, notable UTV releases included Rowdy Rathore and Barfi . On December 3, 2010, the Company sold Miramax Film NY, LLC (Miramax) for $663 million. Net proceeds, which reflected closing adjustments, the settlement of related claims and obligations and Miramaxs cash balances at closing totaled $532 million. The sale included both Miramax and Dimension film assets. Theatrical Market We produce and distribute both live-action films and full-length animated films. During fiscal 2013, we expect to distribute domestically eight of our own produced feature films and one DreamWorks film. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had released domestically approximately 980 full-length live-action features and 90 full-length animated features. We distribute and market our filmed products principally through our own distribution and marketing companies in the U.S. theatrical market. In international theatrical markets, we distribute our filmed products both directly and through independent distribution companies or joint ventures. Films released theatrically in the U.S. may be released simultaneously in international territories or generally up to four months later. The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the publics intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film.  Home Entertainment Market In the domestic market, we distribute home entertainment releases directly under each of our motion picture banners. In the international market, we distribute home entertainment releases under each of our motion picture banners both directly and through independent distribution companies. In addition, we acquire and produce original content for direct-to-video release. Domestic and international home entertainment distribution typically starts three to six months after the theatrical release in each market. Home entertainment releases may be distributed in both physical (DVD and Blu-ray) and electronic formats. Titles are generally sold to retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy and physical rental channels, such as Netflix, Redbox and Blockbuster, however, the rental channels may be delayed up to 28 days after the start of home entertainment distribution. As of September 29, 2012, we had approximately 1,400 active produced and acquired titles, including 1,000 live-action titles and 400 animated titles, in the domestic home entertainment marketplace and approximately 2,700 active produced and acquired titles, including 2,200 live-action titles and 500 animated titles, in the international marketplace. Television Market Pay-Per-View (PPV)/Video-on-Demand (VOD): Concurrently with, or up to one month after, the home entertainment distribution begins, we license titles for use on a PPV/VOD basis to MVPDs, internet, gaming consoles, and mobile platforms. PPV/VOD services deliver titles electronically to consumers for a specified rental period (e.g. 24 hours) at a price comparable to that of physical media rentals. Pay Television (Pay 1): There are generally two pay television windows. The first window is generally sixteen months in duration and follows the PPV/VOD window. The Company has licensed exclusive domestic pay television rights to substantially all films released under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar, and Touchstone Pictures banners to the Starz pay television service through calendar year 2015. DreamWorks titles distributed by the Company are licensed to Showtime under a separate agreement. Free Television (Free 1): The Pay 1 window is followed by a television window that may last up to 84 months. Motion pictures are usually sold in the Free 1 window on an ad-hoc basis to major networks, including ABC, and basic cable services. Pay Television 2 (Pay 2) and Free Television 2 (Free 2): In the U.S., Free 1 is generally followed by a fourteen-month Pay 2 window under our license arrangements with Starz and Showtime, and finally by a Free 2 window. Major packages of the Companys feature films have been licensed for broadcast under multi-year agreements within the Free 2 window. The Free 2 window is a syndication window where films are licensed both to basic cable networks and to third-party television station groups. International Television: The Company also licenses its theatrical properties outside of the U.S. The typical windowing sequence is consistent with the domestic cycle such that titles premiere on television in PPV/VOD then air in pay TV before airing in free TV. Windowing strategies are developed in response to local market practices and conditions, and the exact sequence and length of each window can vary country by country. Disney Music Group The Disney Music Group includes Walt Disney Records, Hollywood Records (including the Mammoth Records and Buena Vista Records labels), Lyric Street Records, Buena Vista Concerts and Disney Music Publishing. Walt Disney Records produces and distributes compact discs and music DVDs in the U.S. and licenses our music properties throughout the rest of the world. Music categories include infant, childrens read-along, teens, all-family and soundtracks from film and television series distributed by Walt Disney Pictures and Disney Channel. Hollywood Records develops, produces and markets recordings from talent across a spectrum of popular music. The Disney Music Group commissions new music for the Companys motion picture and television programs, records the songs and licenses the song copyrights to others for printed music, records, audio-visual devices, public performances and digital distribution. Buena Vista Concerts produces live-entertainment events with artists signed to the Disney Music Group record labels.  Disney Music Publishing controls the copyrights of thousands of musical compositions derived from the Companys motion picture, television, record and theme park properties, as well as musical compositions written by songwriters under exclusive contract. It is responsible for the management, protection, and licensing of the Disney song catalog on a worldwide basis. Disney Theatrical Productions Disney Theatrical Productions develops, produces and licenses live entertainment events. The Company has produced and licensed Broadway musicals around the world, including Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King , Elton John  Tim Rices Aida , Mary Poppins (a co-production with Cameron Mackintosh Ltd), Little Mermaid, Newsies , and TARZAN  . Other stage musical ventures have included an off-Broadway production of Peter and the Starcatcher and, most recently, stage adaptations of the film Aladdin. In addition, the Company licenses musicals for local, school and community theatre productions globally through Music Theatre International. Disney Theatrical Productions also delivers live shows globally through its license to Feld Entertainment, producer of Disney On Ice and Disney Live!. Disney On Ice features several titles the newest of which, Rockin Ever After , launched in August 2012 for North America tours. Competition and Seasonality The Studio Entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television programming services and sponsor live theater. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, advertiser support and broadcast rights that are essential to the success of our Studio Entertainment businesses. The success of Studio Entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, Studio Entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. CONSUMER PRODUCTS The Consumer Products segment engages with among others licensees, publishers and retailers throughout the world who design, develop, publish, promote and sell a wide variety of products based on existing and new characters and other Company intellectual property through its Merchandise Licensing, Publishing and Retail businesses. In addition to leveraging the Companys film and television properties, Consumer Products also develops new intellectual property with the potential of also being used in the Companys other businesses. Merchandise Licensing The Companys merchandise licensing operations cover a diverse range of product categories, the most significant of which are: toys, apparel, home dcor and furnishings, stationery, health and beauty, accessories, food, footwear, and consumer electronics. The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include Mickey Mouse, Cars, Disney Princess, Winnie the Pooh, Toy Story, Disney Fairies, and the Marvel properties including Spider-Man and Avengers. The Company also participates in the design of individual products and creates exclusive themed and seasonal promotional campaigns for retailers based on characters, movies and TV shows. Publishing Disney Publishing Worldwide (DPW) creates, distributes, licenses and publishes childrens books, magazines and digital products in multiple countries and languages based on the Companys Disney-, Pixar- and Marvel-branded franchises. Digital products include content for mobile devices such as e-books and apps, including Disney Princess Dress-Up: My Sticker Book, Minnie Bow Maker, Brave: Story Book Deluxe and Cars 2: World Grand Prix Read and Race. DPW also operates Disney English, which develops curriculum that helps Chinese children learn English through Disney stories in 43 centers across 10 cities in China.  Marvel Publishing creates and publishes comic books, and graphic novel collections of comic books, principally in North America in print and digital formats. Marvel Publishing also licenses the right to publish translated versions of our comic books, principally in Europe and Latin America. Titles include X-Men , The Avengers, Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America , Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk . Retail The Company markets Disney- and Marvel-themed products through retail stores operated under the Disney Store name and through internet sites in North America (DisneyStore.com and Marvelstore.com), Western Europe, and Japan. The stores, which are generally located in leading shopping malls and other retail complexes, carry a wide variety of Disney merchandise and promote other businesses of the Company. The Company currently owns and operates 216 stores in North America, 106 stores in Europe, and 47 stores in Japan. Competition and Seasonality The Companys merchandise licensing, publishing and retail businesses compete with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. Based on independent surveys, we believe the Company is the largest worldwide licensor of character-based merchandise based on retail sales. Operating results for the licensing and retail businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. INTERACTIVE The Interactive segment creates and delivers branded entertainment and lifestyle content across interactive media platforms. The primary operating businesses of Interactive are Interactive Games which produces multi-platform games for global distribution, and Interactive Media, which develops branded online services. Interactive derives revenues from a combination of wholesale sales, licensing, advertising, sponsorships, subscription services and in-game accessories (micro transactions). Interactive also manages the Companys Disney-branded mobile phone business in Japan which provides mobile phone service and content to consumers. Interactive Games The Interactive Games business creates, develops, markets and distributes console and handheld, games worldwide, including 2012 titles such as Disney Universe and Brave. The Interactive Games business also produces online games, such as Disneys Club Penguin and Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow, interactive games for social networking websites such as Gardens of Time and Marvel Avengers Alliance, and games for smartphone platforms such as Wheres My Water and Wheres My Perry . Certain properties are also licensed to third-party video game publishers. On August 27, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of Playdom, Inc., a company that develops and publishes online games for social networking websites. Interactive Media Interactive Media develops, publishes and distributes content for branded online services intended for kids and family entertainment through a portfolio of websites including Disney.com and the Disney Family Network. Interactive Media also provides website maintenance and design for other Company businesses. Disney.com integrates many of the Companys Disney-branded internet sites including sites for the Disney Channel and Walt Disney Pictures. Competition and Seasonality The Companys online sites and products compete with a wide variety of other online sites and products. The Companys video game business competes primarily with other publishers of video game software and other types of home entertainment. Operating results for the video game business fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of the Companys online and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The Companys businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important intellectual property includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of intellectual property rights are set forth in Item 1A  Risk Factors.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. A decline in economic activity in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. The most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming. Recent instability in European economies presents risks of similar impacts in our European operations. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets, or reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets, and economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. Our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.  Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. The media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner and markets in which our products are distributed to consumers, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. For example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including DVD players and digital video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings. In addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and delivery vehicles which may include options we have not yet fully developed, or options we have developed but which entail a smaller return than we realize on traditional options. As a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. New technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. The unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Companys operations worldwide, despite the Companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other products. With respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. The Company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations. Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is  misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. For example, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in Japan, including Tokyo Disney Resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. In addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. As changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included investments in new cruise ships, expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions, and development of a resort facility in Hawaii. In addition, a joint venture in which we participate recently began construction of a theme park in Shanghai, China. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts.  Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. We face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. We also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. For example: ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. ##TABLE_END Competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. Competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. Sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. With approximately 166,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macro-economic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and post retirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. We enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to MVPDs. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term  contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. Our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. These regulations include: ##TABLE_START    U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. See Item 1  Business  Media Networks, Federal Regulation. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Environmental protection regulations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. ##TABLE_END Changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. Our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. Our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than U.S. law. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law governed these operations. Labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. A significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. In addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. In general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. The issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. In addition, provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances.  The seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. Each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Media Networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met. These commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Studio Entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Consumer Products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Revenues in our Interactive segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. ##TABLE_END Accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. The Companys pending acquisition of Lucasfilm is expected to cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. On October 30, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Lucasfilm Ltd. in a merger transaction in which the Company is expected to distribute approximately 40 million shares and pay approximately $2.025 billion in cash. We expect that the merger will initially result in lower earnings per share than we would have earned in the absence of the merger. We expect that over time the merger will yield benefits to the combined company such that the merger will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. However, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the long term will be achieved. In order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the merger, the combined company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of Lucasfilm after the merger, develop successful new content (including future feature films) based on Lucasfilms intellectual property and successfully integrate Lucasfilms products into the combined companys various distribution channels.

Legal Proceedings Celador International Ltd. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. On May 19, 2004, an affiliate of the creator and licensor of the television program, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, filed an action against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and Buena Vista Television, LLC, alleging it was damaged by defendants improperly engaging in certain intra-company transactions and charging merchandise distribution expenses, resulting in an underpayment to the plaintiff. On July 7, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for breach of contract against certain subsidiaries of the Company, awarding plaintiff damages of $269.4 million. The Company has stipulated with the plaintiff to an award of prejudgment interest of $50 million, which amount will be reduced pro rata should the Court of Appeals reduce the damages amount. On December 21, 2010, the Companys alternative motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law were denied. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes the jurys verdict is in error and is vigorously pursuing its position on appeal, notice of which was filed by the Company on January 14, 2011. On or about January 28, 2011, plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal. On October 10, 2012, oral argument on the appeals was held. The Company has determined that it does not have a probable loss under the applicable accounting standard relating to probability of loss for recording a reserve with respect to this litigation and therefore has not recorded a reserve. Beef Products, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. On September 13, 2012, plaintiffs filed an action in South Dakota state court against certain subsidiaries and employees of the Company and others, asserting claims for defamation arising from alleged false statements and implications, statutory and common law product disparagement, and tortious interference with existing and prospective business relationships. The claims arise out of ABC News reports published in March and April 2012 that discussed the subject of labeling requirements for production processes related to a product one plaintiff produces that is added to ground beef before sale to consumers. Plaintiffs seek actual and consequential damages in excess of $400 million, statutory damages (including treble damages) pursuant to South Dakotas Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act, and punitive damages. On October 24, 2012, the Company removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, and on October 31, 2012, the Company moved to dismiss all claims. The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or codefendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not expect the Company to suffer any material liability by reason of these actions.  Executive Officers of the Company The executive officers of the Company are elected each year at the organizational meeting of the Board of Directors, which follows the annual meeting of the shareholders, and at other Board of Directors meetings, as appropriate. Each of the executive officers has been employed by the Company in the position or positions indicated in the list and pertinent notes below. Each of the executive officers has been employed by the Company for more than five years.

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2012 included a $184 million ($116 million after tax) non-cash gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV (UTV Gain) and $79 million ($50 million after tax) for the recovery of a receivable from Lehman Brothers that was written off in 2008 as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy (Lehman recovery), partially offset by $100 million ($63 million after tax) of restructuring and impairment charges and a $24 million net charge ($7 million after tax and allocation to noncontrolling interests) related to the refinancing of Disneyland Paris borrowings (DLP debt charge). These items collectively had a $0.06 net benefit on EPS. Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains from the sales of businesses of $75 million. These items collectively had a $0.02 net negative impact on EPS. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items. ##TABLE_START   Benefit / (Expense)    Pretax   Tax Effect   After Tax  Restructuring and impairment charges  $ (55)   $ 47   $ (8)  Gains on sales of businesses   75    (107)    (32)         $ 20   $ (60)   $ (40)        ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges included an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million. After the impact of the items discussed above, the increase in EPS for fiscal 2012 reflected higher operating results driven by higher fees from MVPDs (Affiliate Fees) at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel, higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN, higher results at our theatrical business driven by Marvels The Avengers , higher ABC program sales, improved social game performance due to lower acquisition accounting impacts and increased title performance, and higher merchandise licensing revenue driven by the strength of Marvel properties. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses at our domestic parks and resorts, higher sports programming costs at ESPN, lower advertising revenue at ABC and our owned television stations and higher film cost write-downs. 2011 vs. 2010 Revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $40.9 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 21%, or $844 million, to $4.8 billion; and EPS increased 24% to $2.52.  The increase in EPS for fiscal 2011 reflected higher operating results driven by Affiliate Fee growth at our Cable Networks, increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN and lower film cost write-downs. Additionally, EPS growth benefited from decreased programming and production costs at ABC, higher licensing revenue due to the strength of Cars merchandise and a full-period of results for Marvel, and higher equity income at AETN. These increases were partially offset by higher costs at ESPN and at our domestic parks and resorts, lower performance at our theatrical business, and the inclusion of a full-period of results for Playdom in fiscal 2011, which included the impact of acquisition accounting. Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $100 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2012. Restructuring charges were driven by severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses. Impairment charges primarily resulted from an intellectual property impairment. The Company recorded $55 million of charges in fiscal 2011 reflecting severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at the Studio Entertainment and Interactive segments. The Company recorded $270 million of charges in fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $263 million at Cable Networks from $3,522 million to $3,785 million, partially offset by a decrease of $162 million at Broadcasting from $4,076 million to $3,914 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 6% due to higher rates. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected decreases of 7% due to lower ABC ratings, and 2% due to lower local television advertising driven by lower political advertising, partially offset by an increase of 5% due to higher ABC advertising rates. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher program sales driven by Castle, Once Upon a Time, and Revenge , partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues, primarily due to Lost , and lower Disney Channel program sales. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $231 million from $8,760 million to $8,991 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production costs of $359 million was primarily due to higher sports rights costs due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, MLB, and NBA programming and expanded rights for the Wimbledon Championships. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $128 million reflecting the absence of The Oprah Winfrey Show at our local television stations and lower program write-offs at ABC. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees increased to $627 million in the current year from $584 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. This increase was partially offset by equity losses at Hulu which were driven by higher programming and marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and subscription revenues. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 8%, or $473 million, to $6.6 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channels, higher program sales, lower broadcast programming costs and increased equity income from AETN, partially offset by lower broadcast advertising revenue.

Parks and Resorts Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  September 29, 2012   October 1, 2011   Revenues    Domestic  $ 10,339   $ 9,302    11 %  International   2,581    2,495    3 %       Total revenues   12,920    11,797    10 %  Operating expenses   (7,928)    (7,383)    (7) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (1,849)    (1,696)    (9) %  Depreciation and amortization   (1,241)    (1,165)    (7) %       Operating Income  $ 1,902   $ 1,553    22 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1.1 billion, to $12.9 billion due to an increase of $1.0 billion at our domestic operations and an increase of $86 million at our international operations. Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 5% increase from higher average guest spending and a 5% increase from volume. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, food and beverage spending, and daily hotel room rates. The volume increase was driven by higher passenger cruise days from the Disney Fantasy and the Disney Dream , which launched in March 2012 and January 2011, respectively, increased attendance at our domestic parks reflecting strong growth at Disneyland Resort which benefited from the opening of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure and higher hotel occupancy from Aulani, our new hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii, which opened in August 2011. Revenue growth of 3% at our international operations reflected a 3% increase from higher average guest spending, a 3% increase from higher attendance and a 3% increase from higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4% from the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and a decrease of 1% from lower hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher daily hotel room rates and average ticket prices. Higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort reflected the prior-year impact from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: ##TABLE_START   Domestic   International (2)   Total    Fiscal Year 2012   Fiscal Year 2011   Fiscal Year 2012   Fiscal Year 2011   Fiscal Year 2012   Fiscal Year 2011  Parks       Increase/ (decrease)       Attendance   3 %    1 %    6 %    6 %    4 %    2 %  Per Capita Guest Spending   7 %    8 %    1 %    2 %    5 %    6 %  Hotels (1)       Occupancy   81 %    82 %    85 %    88 %    82 %    83 %  Available Room Nights (in thousands)   9,850    9,625    2,468    2,466    12,318    12,091  Per Room Guest Spending  $ 257   $ 241   $ 317   $ 294   $ 270   $ 253  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.30 and $1.39 for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor which increased by $285 million from $3,540 million to $3,825 million and cost of sales which increased $96 million from $1,198 million to $1,294 million. Higher operating labor was driven by new guest offerings, labor cost inflation and higher employee benefit costs. The increase in cost of sales was driven by higher volumes. Operating expenses also increased due to costs associated with resort expansion and new guest offerings including investments in supporting systems infrastructure. New guest offerings included the Disney Fantasy and Disney Dream, and the expansion of Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. These increases were partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the collection of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the prior-year earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by marketing for resort expansion and new guest offerings and labor and other cost inflation. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 22%, or $349 million, to $1.9 billion driven by increases at our domestic parks and resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. Studio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  September 29, 2012   October 1, 2011 (1)   Revenues    Theatrical distribution  $ 1,470   $ 1,733    (15) %  Home entertainment   2,221    2,435    (9) %  Television distribution and other   2,134    2,183    (2) %       Total revenues   5,825    6,351    (8) %  Operating expenses   (2,908)    (3,253)    11 %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,053)    (2,348)    13 %  Depreciation and amortization   (142)    (132)    (8) %       Operating Income  $ 722   $ 618    17 %       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation ##TABLE_END  Revenues Lower theatrical distribution revenues were driven by fewer releases, partially offset by the strong performance of Marvels The Avengers. Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 12% decrease from a decline in unit sales reflecting lower catalog sales and the performance of the current-year titles. Significant titles in the current year included Marvels The Avengers and Cars 2 while the prior year included Toy Story 3 and Tangled. The decrease was partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher net effective pricing domestically which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. The decrease in television distribution and other revenue was driven by lower revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the prior-year performance of Cars merchandise. Television distribution revenue was comparable to the prior year as higher syndication sales in international markets was offset by lower sales in the domestic pay television market. Cost and Expenses Operating expenses included a decrease of $200 million in film cost amortization, from $1,885 million to $1,685 million, driven by lower home entertainment sales volume and a lower average production cost amortization rate for television distribution sales, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold which decreased $145 million from $1,368 million to $1,223 million driven by a decline in home entertainment sales volume and fewer theatrical titles in release. The decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing expenses at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses driven by fewer major releases in the current year. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 17% to $722 million primarily due to improved results at our domestic theatrical and television distribution businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs in the current year. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges of $18 million, $33 million and $151 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily due to an impairment of an intellectual property intangible asset. The charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2010 were primarily for the closure of a production facility, the write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned film projects, and severance costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Consumer Products Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  September 29, 2012   October 1, 2011   Revenues    Licensing and publishing  $ 2,056   $ 1,933    6 %  Retail and other   1,196    1,116    7 %       Total revenues   3,252    3,049    7 %  Operating expenses   (1,384)    (1,334)    (4) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (816)    (794)    (3) %  Depreciation and amortization   (115)    (105)    (10) %       Operating Income  $ 937   $ 816    15 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues The 6% increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a decreased revenue share with Studio Entertainment due to lower revenues from Cars merchandise, higher performance of Spider-Man, Minnie and Mickey and Avengers merchandise and higher recognition of minimum guarantees.  The 7% increase in retail and other revenue reflected growth at our retail business driven by new stores in North America and Europe, increased online sales due to promotional events, and higher comparable store sales in North America. These increases were partially offset by lower comparable store sales in Europe. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase of $26 million in cost of goods sold, from $567 million to $593 million, driven by increased sales volume at our retail business. Operating expenses also increased 1% due to higher distribution costs driven by higher third-party royalties and 1% due to higher labor and occupancy costs driven by the expansion of the Disney English business in China and new retail stores in North America and Europe. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses was driven by higher marketing and promotions expense. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 15% to $937 million due to increases at our licensing and retail businesses. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $34 million and $16 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2012 and 2010, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2012 and 2010 were primarily due to severance costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interactive Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  September 29, 2012   October 1, 2011 (1)   Revenues    Game sales and subscriptions  $ 613   $ 768    (20) %  Advertising and other   232    214    8 %       Total revenues   845    982    (14) %  Operating expenses   (583)    (675)    14 %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (429)    (561)    24 %  Depreciation and amortization   (49)    (54)    9 %       Operating Loss  $ (216)   $ (308)    30 %       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation ##TABLE_END Revenues The decrease in game sales and subscriptions revenue reflected a 29% decrease from lower console game unit sales and a 8% decrease from lower net effective pricing of console games reflecting the strong performance of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean , Cars 2 and Epic Mickey in the prior-year period. The decrease was partially offset by an 11% increase from higher social games revenue reflecting improved title performance in the current period and lower acquisition accounting impacts. Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by an increase at our mobile phone service in Japan which included a benefit from higher rates. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included a $21 million decrease in product development costs from $352 million to $331 million driven by decreased console game development. Operating expenses also include cost of sales, which decreased by $71 million from $323 million to $252 million driven by lower console game sales volume, partially offset by an increase at social games associated with revenue growth. The decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing costs at our console games business driven by fewer releases in the current period, lower acquisition accounting expenses at our social games business, and higher cost allocations to other Company businesses related to website design and maintenance and online revenues.  Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss decreased 30% to $216 million driven by improved results at our social games and online businesses partially offset by a decrease at our console games business. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $21 million, $22 million and $2 million related to Interactive for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively which were primarily for severance costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2012 vs. 2011 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 3%, from $459 million to $474 million due to higher compensation related costs and charitable contributions. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   % Change Better/(Worse)  Interest expense   $ (472)    $ (435)    (9)%  Interest and investment income   103    92    12 %       Net interest expense   $ (369)    $ (343)    (8)%       ##TABLE_END The increase in interest expense reflected higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Effective Income Tax Rate ##TABLE_START   2012   2011   Change Better/(Worse)  Effective income tax rate   33.3 %    34.6 %    1.3 ppt  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points for the year due to the impact in the prior-year of the gain on the sale of Miramax and an increase in earnings from foreign operations subject to tax at rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate. The book value of Miramax included non-deductible goodwill such that the taxable gain on the sale of Miramax resulted in tax expense that exceeded the book gain causing an increase in the prior-year effective tax rate. The decreases from the impacts of the Miramax gain and foreign earnings were partially offset by an increase due to the tax rate benefit in the prior-year related to an impairment charge. The prior-year impairment charge related to assets that had tax basis in excess of the book value resulting in a tax benefit that exceeded the pre-tax impairment charge causing a decrease in the prior-year effective tax rate. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $40 million to $491 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort partially offset by lower operating results at Disneyland Paris including the impact of the DLP debt charge. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $626 million, $576 million, and $482 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2012 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan  obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. In fiscal 2013, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $66 million to $692 million, including $458 million of recognition of net actuarial losses, driven by a lower assumed discount rate. Pension and postretirement medical costs for fiscal 2012 included $340 million of net actuarial losses. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans to $4.8 billion and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $5.1 billion ($3.2 billion after tax) as of September 29, 2012. If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 8 years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements. During fiscal 2012, the Company contributed $905 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2013 to total approximately $425 million to $475 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2013 will be determined based on our January 1, 2013 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2013. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs. BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2011 vs. 2010 Media Networks Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended (1)   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Affiliate Fees  $ 8,837   $ 8,122    9 %  Advertising   7,598    7,028    8 %  Other   2,279    2,012    13 %       Total revenues   18,714    17,162    9 %  Operating expenses   (10,282)    (9,787)    (5) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,633)    (2,459)    (7) %  Depreciation and amortization   (237)    (222)    (7) %  Equity in the income of investees   584    438    33 %       Operating Income  $ 6,146   $ 5,132    20 %       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation ##TABLE_END Revenues Affiliate Fee growth of 9% was driven by increases of 6% from higher contractual rates, 1% from favorable impacts of foreign currency translation, and 1% from subscriber growth at Cable Networks and an increase of 1% from Broadcasting due to new contractual provisions. Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $471 million at Cable Networks from $3,051 million to $3,522 million and an increase of $99 million at Broadcasting from $3,977 million to $4,076 million. The increase at Cable Networks of 14% was due to higher rates. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 6% due to higher ABC advertising rates, primarily in primetime, and 1% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 4% due to lower ABC ratings primarily in primetime and daytime. The increase in other revenues was driven by a change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher sales of Disney Channel programming, partially offset by lower sales of ABC Studios productions driven by no new seasons of Lost and Ghost Whisperer .  Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $211 million from $8,549 million to $8,760 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production spending of $419 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to the addition of college football programming including more Bowl Championship Series games some of which shifted from ABC, increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming and more episodes of original programming at the Disney Channels, partially offset by the absence of programming costs for the FIFA World Cup which was broadcast in fiscal 2010. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $208 million reflecting lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives, a lower cost mix of programming in primetime due to a shift of hours from original scripted programming to reality programming, a shift of college sports programming to ESPN and lower production cost amortization due to a decrease in sales of ABC Studios productions. Operating expenses also increased by 2% due to a change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and increased by 1% resulting from headcount growth and labor cost inflation at ESPN. The increase in selling, general and administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing and sales costs, which included an increase due to the change in transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher marketing costs at ESPN. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees increased to $584 million in fiscal 2011 from $438 million in fiscal 2010 driven by an increase at AETN primarily due to a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs in fiscal 2010 and higher advertising and affiliate revenues in the current year, partially offset by higher marketing costs. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 20%, or $1.0 billion, to $6.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, ABC, the worldwide Disney Channels, AETN and the owned television stations. The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Cable Networks  $ 12,877   $ 11,475    12 %  Broadcasting   5,837    5,687    3 %        $ 18,714   $ 17,162    9 %       Segment operating income    Cable Networks  $ 5,233   $ 4,473    17 %  Broadcasting   913    659    39 %        $ 6,146   $ 5,132    20 %       ##TABLE_END Parks and Resorts Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Domestic  $ 9,302   $ 8,404    11 %  International   2,495    2,357    6 %       Total revenues   11,797    10,761    10 %  Operating expenses   (7,383)    (6,787)    (9) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (1,696)    (1,517)    (12) %  Depreciation and amortization   (1,165)    (1,139)    (2) %       Operating Income  $ 1,553   $ 1,318    18 %       ##TABLE_END  Revenues Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1.0 billion, to $11.8 billion due to an increase of $898 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $138 million at our international operations. Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 6% increase driven by higher average guest spending and a 3% increase due to volume driven by higher passenger cruise days as a result of the launch of the Disney Dream , in January 2011, and higher attendance. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates, and food, beverage, and merchandise spending. Revenue growth of 6% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase due to higher average guest spending, a 3% increase driven by volume due to higher attendance and hotel occupancy, and a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease due to the sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris in fiscal 2010 and a 1% decrease due to the temporary closure of the Tokyo Disney Resort following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.

The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.39 and $1.36 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor which increased by $262 million from $3,278 million to $3,540 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. Operating expenses also include cost of sales which increased $88 million from $1,110 million to $1,198 million driven by volume, partially offset by the absence of the costs related to a real estate sale at Disneyland Paris in fiscal 2010. Operating expenses also increased due to launch and operating costs in connection with the Disney Dream , enhancement and expansion costs, including new guest offerings at Disney California Adventure and investments in systems infrastructure, and costs for Aulani, which opened in August 2011. In addition, there was an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing costs at our domestic parks and resorts, costs associated with the addition of the Disney Dream and Aulani, our new resort in Hawaii, and labor cost inflation. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 18%, or $235 million, to $1.6 billion due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by costs for Aulani and a decrease at Tokyo Disney Resort.  Studio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended (1)   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Theatrical distribution  $ 1,733   $ 2,050    (15) %  Home entertainment   2,435    2,666    (9) %  Television distribution and other   2,183    1,985    10 %       Total revenues   6,351    6,701    (5) %  Operating expenses   (3,253)    (3,548)    8 %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (2,348)    (2,371)    1 %  Depreciation and amortization   (132)    (89)    (48) %       Operating Income  $ 618   $ 693    (11) %       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation ##TABLE_END Revenues The decrease in theatrical distribution revenue reflected the success of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Cars 2, Thor and Captain America in fiscal 2011. Lower home entertainment revenue reflected an 11% decrease due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for Studio distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product, partially offset by a 1% increase due to higher net effective pricing internationally which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. The increase in television distribution and other revenues reflected 5% growth due to the inclusion of Marvel which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a 4% increase due to higher revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. Cost and Expenses Operating expenses included a decrease of $257 million in film cost amortization, from $2,142 million to $1,885 million, driven by lower film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include cost of sales and distribution expenses which decreased $38 million from $1,406 million to $1,368 million driven by the change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product. Selling, general, administrative and other costs were essentially flat as higher marketing for Marvel titles and an increase in technology infrastructure spending were largely offset by lower theatrical pre-release marketing expense and the change in the transfer pricing arrangement with Media Networks for home entertainment product. The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by higher amortization of intangible assets related to certain Marvel film properties. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 11%, or $75 million, to $618 million primarily due to lower results at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and higher technology infrastructure spending, partially offset by lower film cost write-downs and a higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment.  Consumer Products Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Licensing and publishing  $ 1,933   $ 1,725    12 %  Retail and other   1,116    953    17 %       Total revenues   3,049    2,678    14 %  Operating expenses   (1,334)    (1,236)    (8) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (794)    (687)    (16) %  Depreciation and amortization   (105)    (78)    (35) %       Operating Income  $ 816   $ 677    21 %       ##TABLE_END Revenues The increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a 6% increase driven by the strong performance of Cars, Tangled and Toy Story merchandise and a 8% increase due to higher revenue from Marvel properties. Higher revenues from Marvel properties reflected the impact of acquisition accounting which reduced revenue recognition in fiscal 2010 as well as a full year of operations as Marvel was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease due to a higher revenue share to the Studio Entertainment segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. The increase in retail and other revenues was primarily due to a 9% increase from higher revenues at the Disney Store in North America and Europe driven by higher comparable store sales and a 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan, which was acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Licensing and publishing and retail and other revenues also increased by 2% and 3%, respectively, due to the benefit from a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase of $57 million in cost of goods sold, from $521 million to $578 million, driven by the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. Operating expenses also included a 2% increase due to higher occupancy costs driven by an increase at our retail business reflecting the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and a 1% increase due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the inclusion of a full year of operations for Marvel and various promotional initiatives across multiple businesses. The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets for Marvel and an increase at the Disney Stores due to new stores and remodels. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 21%, or $139 million, to $816 million primarily due to increases in our Merchandise Licensing and North American retail businesses.  Interactive Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended (1)   % Change Better / (Worse)  (in millions)  October 1, 2011   October 2, 2010   Revenues    Game sales and subscriptions  $ 768   $ 563    36 %  Advertising and other   214    198    8 %       Total revenues   982    761    29 %  Operating expenses   (675)    (554)    (22) %  Selling, general, administrative and other   (561)    (398)    (41) %  Depreciation and amortization   (54)    (43)    (26) %       Operating Loss  $ (308)   $ (234)    (32) %       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation ##TABLE_END Revenues Game sales and subscriptions revenue growth reflected a 12% increase due to higher console game unit sales and a 10% increase due to higher net effective pricing of console games, reflecting the strong performance of Epic Mickey and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and a shift in sales from catalog titles to new releases. Additionally, the inclusion of Playdom for a full year compared to one month in fiscal 2010 resulted in a 10% increase in game sales and subscription revenues. Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by our mobile phone service in Japan. Costs and Expenses Operating expense included a $44 million increase in product development expense from $308 million to $352 million primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year. Operating expenses also included a 14% increase due to higher cost of sales driven by fees paid to the developer of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and higher console game unit sales. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss was $308 million compared to $234 million in fiscal 2010 as an improvement at our console game business was more than offset by the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2011 vs. 2010 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 9%, from $420 million to $459 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses and compensation related costs. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2010   % Change Better/(Worse)  Interest expense  $ (435)   $ (456)    5 %  Interest and investment income   92    47    96 %       Net interest expense  $ (343)   $ (409)    16 %       ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2011 reflected lower effective interest rates. The increase in interest and investment income for fiscal 2011 was driven by gains on sales of investments.  Effective Income Tax Rate ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   Change Better/(Worse)  Effective income tax rate   34.6%    34.9%    0.3 ppt  ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points for the year as a prior year charge related to health care reform legislation and a current year benefit from an increase in the domestic production deduction rate were largely offset by a decrease in favorable resolutions of prior-year tax matters. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $72 million charge related to the enactment of health care reform legislation in March 2010. Under this legislation the Companys deductions for retiree prescription drug benefits will generally be reduced by the amount of Medicare Part D drug subsidies received beginning in fiscal year 2014. Under applicable accounting rules, the Company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset, which was established for the future deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefit costs, to reflect the lost deductions. The reduction was recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the legislation was enacted. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $101 million to $451 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   2010  Cash provided by operations  $ 7,966   $ 6,994   $ 6,578  Cash used by investing activities   (4,759)    (3,286)    (4,523)  Cash used by financing activities   (2,985)    (3,233)    (2,663)  Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents   (20)    (12)    (87)        Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ 202   $ 463   $ (695)        ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 increased 14% or $1.0 billion to $8.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher net operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products businesses and lower operating cash payments at Studio Entertainment driven by lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs. These cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at Parks and Resorts, lower revenues at Studio Entertainment and higher interest and income tax payments. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation and costs for resort expansion and new guest offerings. The increase in interest payments was primarily due to the payment of previously accrued interest on Disneyland Paris borrowings. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 increased 6% or $416 million to $7.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products and Interactive businesses, partially offset by lower revenues at our Studio Entertainment business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments at Corporate and at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive, and Consumer Products businesses, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments at our Studio Entertainment business. The increase in cash payments at Corporate was driven by higher contributions to our pension plans, while the increase at Media Networks was primarily due to higher investment in television programming and production. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher promotional and operating costs from the January 2011 launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , and higher marketing and sales expenses and expansion costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. The increase in cash payments at Interactive reflects the inclusion of Playdom, while the increase in cash payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. The decrease in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower film production spending.  Depreciation expense is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   2010  Media Networks    Cable Networks  $ 141   $ 134   $ 118  Broadcasting   100    95    95        Total Media Networks   241    229    213        Parks and Resorts    Domestic   927    842    807  International   314    323    332        Total Parks and Resorts   1,241    1,165    1,139        Studio Entertainment   48    53    56  Consumer Products   55    48    33  Interactive   17    16    19  Corporate   182    148    142        Total depreciation expense  $ 1,784   $ 1,659   $ 1,602        ##TABLE_END Amortization of intangible assets is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   2010  Media Networks  $ 17   $ 8   $ 9  Parks and Resorts             Studio Entertainment   94    79    33  Consumer Products   60    57    45  Interactive   32    38    24  Corporate                   Total amortization of intangible assets  $ 203   $ 182   $ 111        ##TABLE_END The Companys Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.  The Companys film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   2010  Beginning balances:    Production and programming assets  $ 5,031   $ 5,451   $ 5,756  Programming liabilities   (866)    (990)    (1,193)          4,165    4,461    4,563        Spending:    Film and television production   3,385    3,184    3,370  Broadcast programming   4,763    4,588    4,316          8,148     7,772    7,686        Amortization:    Film and television production   (3,330)    (3,521)    (3,593)  Broadcast programming   (4,766)    (4,583)    (4,331)          (8,096)    (8,104)    (7,924)        Change in film and television production and programming costs   52    (332)    (238)        Other non-cash activity   188    36    136  Ending balances:    Production and programming assets   5,217    5,031    5,451  Programming liabilities   (812)    (866)    (990)         $ 4,405    $ 4,165   $ 4,461        ##TABLE_END Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts, and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2011   2010  Media Networks    Cable Networks  $ 170   $ 179   $ 132  Broadcasting   85    128    92  Parks and Resorts    Domestic   2,242    2,294    1,295  International   641    429    238  Studio Entertainment   79    118    102  Consumer Products   69    115    97  Interactive   27    21    17  Corporate   471    275    137         $ 3,784   $ 3,559   $ 2,110        ##TABLE_END Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new rides and attractions, cruise ships, recurring capital and capital improvements, and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by resort expansion and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and construction costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by reduced expenditures at Disneyland Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflected the final payment on our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , theme park and resort expansions and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the development of Shanghai Disney Resort.  Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities. Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increases in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were driven by investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. Other Investing Activities During fiscal 2012, acquisitions totaled $1.0 billion primarily due to the acquisition of an incremental 43% interest in UTV and a 49% interest in Seven TV network in Russia. We also made a $300 million equity contribution to AETN. During fiscal 2011, we received proceeds from dispositions of $564 million primarily from the sale of Miramax and invested $184 million for acquisitions which included additional payments related to the acquisition of Playdom, Inc. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During fiscal 2010, cash used for acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc., and we received net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $3.0 billion compared to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2011. The net use of cash in the current year was driven by repurchases of common stock and dividend payments totaling $4.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.0 billion and net borrowings of $0.4 billion. The decrease in cash used by financing activities of $0.2 billion compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $1.7 billion in repurchases of common stock and dividend payments, partially offset by $1.2 billion less net borrowings and $0.1 billion lower proceeds from stock options. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2010. The net use of cash in fiscal 2011 was driven by repurchases of common stock and dividend payments totaling $5.7 billion, partially offset by net borrowings of $1.6 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.1 billion. The increase in cash used by financing activities of $0.6 billion compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 billion in repurchases of common stock and dividend payments, partially offset by $1.8 billion more net borrowings. During the year ended September 29, 2012, the Companys borrowing activity was as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  October 1, 2011   Additions   Payments   Other Activity   September 29, 2012  Commercial paper borrowings  $ 1,583   $ 467   $    $    $ 2,050  U.S. medium-term notes   8,400    2,977    (1,268)    8    10,117  European medium-term notes and other foreign currency denominated borrowings (1)   1,111    800    (842)    246    1,315  Other   572    2    (82)    70    562  Disneyland Paris borrowings (2)   1,981        (1,897)    (84)      Hong Kong Disneyland borrowings (3)   330            (63)    267            Total  $ 13,977   $ 4,246   $ (4,089)   $ 177   $ 14,311            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  The other activity is primarily borrowings assumed in the acquisition of UTV. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  The other activity is primarily due to the conversion of a portion of the HKSARs loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ##TABLE_END  The Companys bank facilities are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Committed Capacity   Capacity Used   Unused Capacity  Bank facilities expiring February 2015  $ 2,250   $    $ 2,250  Bank facilities expiring February 2017   2,250        2,250        Total  $ 4,500   $    $ 4,500        ##TABLE_END In June 2012, the Company entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders which expires 2017. This facility replaced an existing three-year $2.25 billion facility which was scheduled to expire in 2013, and in combination with the existing $2.25 billion facility that matures in 2015, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.26% to 1.93%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in February 2015, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of September 29, 2012, $258 million of letters of credit had been issued of which none were issued under this facility. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. The Company paid a $0.60 per share dividend ($1.1 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to fiscal 2011. The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010, and paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 72 million shares of Disney common stock for $3.0 billion. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135 million shares of Disney common stock for $5.0 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80 million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 232 million additional shares. We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See Item 1A  Risk Factors. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 29, 2012, Moodys Investors Services long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard  Poors long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitchs long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 29, 2012, by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default. In September 2012, the Company provided 1.3 billion of financing to ED which ED used to repay its outstanding third-party bank debt. The repayment eliminated certain financial and operating covenants, notably those related to capital expenditure limitations and the payment of royalties and management fees due to the Company. There was no net increase in consolidated borrowings for the Company as a result of the refinancing. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 29, 2012 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period  (in millions)  Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   4-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Borrowings (Note 8) (1)  $ 18,586   $ 4,025   $ 3,376   $ 3,787   $ 7,398  Operating lease commitments (Note 14)   2,323    471    673    388    791  Capital lease obligations (Note 14)   760    61    114    56    529  Sports programming commitments (Note 14)   40,664    3,708    8,805    7,618    20,533  Broadcast programming commitments (Note 14)   2,116    1,090    544    402    80            Total sports and other broadcast programming commitments   42,780    4,798    9,349    8,020    20,613  Other (2)   4,615    2,168    1,129    351    967            Total contractual obligations (3)  $ 69,064   $ 11,523   $ 14,641   $ 12,602   $ 30,298            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $296 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt, and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Contractual commitments include the following: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  $ 15,968  Commitments not recorded on the balance sheet   53,096     $ 69,064    ##TABLE_END The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees The Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys contingent commitments and contractual guarantees. Legal and Tax Matters As disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Film and Television Revenues and Costs We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.  With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the programs rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. Revenue Recognition The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated. We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a five-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.  Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 3.85% at the end of fiscal 2012 from 4.75% at the end of fiscal 2011 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our September 29, 2012 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2013. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2013 by $265 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 29, 2012 by $2.3 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $226 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for both of the 2012 and 2011 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2013 annual benefit expense by approximately $82 million. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third-party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over  the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were not material. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. Income Tax Audits As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A  Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K.  ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. Policies and Procedures In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Companys portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. Value at Risk (VAR) The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Companys computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at fiscal year end. The model includes all of the Companys debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. VAR on a combined basis increased to $79 million at September 29, 2012 from $58 million at October 1, 2011. The increase in VAR primarily reflected an increase in foreign exchange exposures and greater sensitivity to interest rates in our fixed rate debt portfolio.  The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2012  Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments   Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments   Equity Sensitive Financial Instruments   Combined Portfolio  Year end VAR   $44    $47    $3    $79  Average VAR   $46    $33    $4    $70  Highest VAR   $51    $47    $6    $79  Lowest VAR   $40    $22    $3    $65  Beginning of year VAR (year end fiscal 2011)   $34    $27    $7    $58  ##TABLE_END The VAR for Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is immaterial as of September 29, 2012 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.

", "9B": " ITEM 9B. Other Information Employment Agreements The Company has entered into new employment agreements with Ms. Mary Jayne Parker and Mr. Kevin Mayer, pursuant to which each has agreed to extend the term of his/her employment with the Company. The new employment agreement for Ms. Parker (the Parker Agreement) was entered into on November 16, 2012 and has a stated term commencing as of September 1, 2012 and ending on January 31, 2017. The Parker Agreement took effect as of the termination of the employment agreement Ms. Parker entered into with the Company in 2009, which expired by its terms on August 31, 2012. Under the Parker Agreement, Ms. Parker continues to serve as the Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company. The Parker Agreement provides that Ms. Parker will receive an annual salary of $700,000, commencing as of January 1, 2013, and that for each year thereafter the annual salary for Ms. Parker will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion but shall not be less than $700,000. The Parker Agreement provides that Ms. Parker is also eligible for an annual, performance-based bonus under the Companys applicable annual incentive plan (currently, the Companys Management Incentive Bonus Program) and that the Compensation Committee will set a target bonus each year of not less 125% of the annual base salary for Ms. Parker in effect at the end of the preceding fiscal year. The actual amount payable to Ms. Parker as an annual bonus will be dependent upon the achievement of performance objectives, which will be substantially the same as the objectives established under the plan for other executive officers of the Company. Depending on performance, the actual amount payable as an annual bonus to Ms. Parker may be less than, greater than or equal to the stated target bonus (and could be zero). The new employment agreement for Mr. Mayer (the Mayer Agreement) was entered into on November 16, 2012 and has a stated term commencing as of October 1, 2012 and ending on January 31, 2017. The Mayer Agreement took effect as of the termination of the employment agreement Mr. Mayer entered into with the Company in 2008, which expired by its terms on September 30, 2012. Under the Mayer Agreement, Mr. Mayer continues to serve as the Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development of the Company. The Mayer Agreement provides that Mr. Mayer will receive an annual salary of $900,000, commencing as of January 1, 2013, and that for each year thereafter the annual salary for Mr. Mayer will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion but shall not be less than $900,000. The Mayer Agreement provides that Mr. Mayer is also eligible for an annual, performance-based bonus under the Companys applicable annual incentive plan (currently, the Companys Management Incentive Bonus Program) and that the Compensation Committee will set a target bonus each year of not less 125% of the annual base salary for Mr. Mayer in effect at the end of the preceding fiscal year. The actual amount payable to Mr. Mayer as an annual bonus will be dependent upon the achievement of performance objectives, which will be substantially the same as the objectives established under the plan for other executive officers of the Company. Depending on performance, the actual amount payable as an annual bonus to Mr. Mayer may be less than, greater than or equal to the stated target bonus (and could be zero). As to both Ms. Parker and Mr. Mayer (in each case, the Executive), the Agreements also provide that the Executive is entitled to participate in the Companys equity-based long-term incentive plans and programs generally made available to executive officers of the Company and that for each fiscal year during the term of the Agreement, Executive will be granted a long-term incentive award having a target value of not less than two times his/her annual base salary at the end of the preceding fiscal year. These awards will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting and performance conditions) as will be established for other executive officers of the Company in accordance with the Boards policies for the grant of equity-based awards, as in effect at the time of the award, and do not guarantee the Executive any minimum amount of compensation. The actual amounts payable to Executive in respect of such opportunities will be determined based on the extent to which any performance conditions and/or service conditions applicable to such awards are satisfied and on the value of the Companys stock. Accordingly, the Executive may receive compensation in respect of any such award that is greater or less than the stated target value, depending on whether, and to what extent, the applicable performance and other conditions are satisfied, and on the value of the Companys stock. Under both the Parker and Mayer Agreements, the Executive is entitled to participate in employee benefits and perquisites generally made available to executive officers of the Company. Under each Agreement, the Executives employment may be terminated by the Company for cause, which is defined to include gross negligence, gross misconduct, willful nonfeasance or a willful material breach of the Agreement. Each Executive has the right to terminate his/her employment for good reason, which is defined as (i) a reduction in any of the Executives base salary, annual target bonus opportunity or annual target long-term incentive award opportunity;  (ii) removal from the Executives position (in Ms. Parkers case, Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer and in Mr. Mayers case, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development); (iii) a material reduction in the Executives duties and responsibilities; (iv) the assignment to Executive of duties that are materially inconsistent with his/her position or duties or that materially impair his/her ability to function in his/her current position or any other position in which he/she is then serving; (vi) relocation of Executives principal office to a location that is more than 50 miles outside of the greater Los Angeles area; or (vii) a material breach of any material provision of the Agreement by the Company. Following a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Companys stock plans, good reason also includes any event that is a triggering event as defined in the plans. A triggering event is defined to include a termination of employment by the Company other than for cause or a termination of employment by the participant following a reduction in position, pay or other constructive termination. Under each Agreement, in the event that the Executives employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the Executive for good reason, the Executive will be entitled to termination benefits, which include the following: (i) a lump sum payment of the base salary that would have been payable over the remaining term of the Agreement, (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (any prior-year bonus not yet paid at time of termination is also paid), and (iii) the Executives outstanding unvested stock options and outstanding unvested restricted stock unit awards that could vest in accordance with their scheduled vesting provisions if the Executives employment had continued through the remaining term of the Agreement will be eligible to vest at the same time and subject to the same performance conditions as though the Executive continued in the Companys employ, and all stock options, whether vested on date of termination or vesting thereafter as described above, shall vest and remain exercisable to the same extent as if the Executives employment had continued through the term of the Agreement. However, each Agreement provides that, unless necessary to preserve the tax deductibility of the compensation payable in respect of restricted stock units, the Company will waive any performance conditions related to performance in future fiscal years that were imposed primarily to permit the Company to claim a tax deduction for the compensation payable in respect of such units. To qualify for the foregoing cash severance benefit, pro-rated bonus (and prior-year bonus, if not already paid), opportunity to vest in unvested equity awards available under each Agreement and extended exercisability of stock options following an involuntary termination by the Company without cause, or a termination by the Executive for good reason, the Executive must execute a release in favor of the Company and agree to provide the Company with certain consulting services for a period of six months after his/her termination (or, if less, for the remaining term of the Agreement). Additionally, during the period of these consulting services, the Executive must also agree not to provide any services to entities that compete with any of the Companys business segments. The foregoing description is qualified by reference to the terms of the Parker Agreement and the Mayer Agreement, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10. 7 and 10.6, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Business The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in four business segments: Media Networks; Parks, Experiences and Products; Studio Entertainment; and Direct-to-Consumer  International (DTCI). For convenience, the terms Company, we and our are used to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted. The Company employed approximately 223,000 people as of September 28, 2019 . On March 20, 2019, the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., which was subsequently renamed TFCF Corporation, a diversified global media and entertainment company. Prior to the acquisition, TFCF and a newly-formed subsidiary of TFCF (New Fox) entered into a separation agreement, pursuant to which TFCF transferred to New Fox a portfolio of TFCFs news, sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets. TFCF retained all of the assets and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, the most significant of which were the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, certain cable networks (primarily FX and National Geographic), TFCFs international television businesses (including Star) and TFCFs 30% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu). Under the terms of the agreement governing the acquisition, the Company will generally phase-out Fox brands by 2024, but has perpetual rights to certain Fox brands, including the Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Searchlight brands. As a result of the acquisition, the Companys ownership interest in Hulu increased to 60%, and the Company started consolidating the results of Hulu as of the acquisition date. In May 2019, the Company increased its ownership interest in Hulu to 67%, with NBC Universal (NBCU) owning the remaining 33%. Also in May 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the acquisition of TFCF, the Company agreed to sell TFCFs regional sports networks (RSN) and sports media operations in Brazil and Mexico. The sale of the RSNs was completed in August 2019. See Notes 4, 12 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the TFCF, Hulu and RSNs transactions. In November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer video streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming. The service was launched in the U.S. and four other countries, with further launches in other countries planned throughout 2020 and 2021.

The majority of the domestic cable networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising sales. Generally, the Companys cable networks provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs that include contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis.

Competition and Seasonality The Companys Media Networks businesses compete for viewers primarily with other broadcast and cable networks, independent television stations and other media, such as online video services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks and radio stations, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas. The Companys Media Networks businesses face competition from other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Companys contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place. The Companys Media Networks businesses also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies, SVOD providers and direct-to-consumer services for the acquisition of sports rights, talent, show concepts, scripted and other programming, and exhibition outlets. The Companys internet websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products. Advertising revenues at Media Networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate fees are generally collected ratably throughout the year. Federal Regulation Television and radio broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect our Media Networks segment include the following: ##TABLE_START  Licensing of television and radio stations. Each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Television and radio station ownership limits. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. Currently: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience. Pursuant to the most recent decision by the FCC as to how to calculate compliance with this limit, our eight stations reach approximately 20% of the national audience. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  FCC regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations. We do not believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Dual networks. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks  ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC  from being under common ownership or control. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation of programming. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning indecent programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during childrens programming. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $400 thousand per indecent utterance or image per station. ##TABLE_END Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast channels are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a significant purpose meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. ##TABLE_START  Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. With respect to cable systems operating within a television stations Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either must carry status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the stations market, or retransmission consent status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. Under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and its successors, including most recently the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), which also requires the must carry or retransmission consent election, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television stations signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. The ABC owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent. Portions of these satellite laws are set to expire on December 31, 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cable and satellite carriage of programming. The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations regarding cable and satellite retransmission consent, and some cable and satellite companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on cable and satellite systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the Companys operations. ##TABLE_END The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, other legislation and specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCCs regulatory authority. FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

Many cruise vacations include a visit to Disneys Castaway Cay, a 1,000-acre private Bahamian island. The Company is expanding its cruise business by adding three new ships. The first ship, the Disney Wish , is scheduled for delivery in late 2021 and is expected to set sail beginning in January 2022. The other two ships are scheduled to be delivered in calendar 2022 and 2023. Each new ship can be powered by liquefied natural gas and will be approximately 140,000 tons with 1,250 staterooms. In fiscal 2019, the Company finalized an agreement with the Government of The Bahamas to create and manage a destination at Lighthouse Point on the island of Eleuthera, which is scheduled to open in late 2022 or 2023. Adventures by Disney Adventures by Disney offers guided tour packages predominantly at non-Disney sites around the world.

National Geographic offered approximately 2,500 different tour packages during 2019 (including the period prior to the Company's acquisition of TFCF). Walt Disney Imagineering Walt Disney Imagineering provides master planning, real estate development, attraction, entertainment and show design, engineering support, production support, project management and research and development for the Companys Parks, Experiences and Products operations. Consumer Products Licensing The Companys merchandise licensing operations cover a diverse range of product categories, the most significant of which are: toys, apparel, home dcor and furnishings, accessories, health and beauty, food, stationery, footwear and consumer electronics. The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include: Mickey and Minnie, Star Wars, Avengers, Frozen, Disney Princess, Toy Story, Spider-Man, Disney Channel characters, Cars, Winnie the Pooh and Disney Classics. Retail The Company sells Disney-, Marvel-, Pixar- and Lucasfilm-branded products through retail stores operated under The Disney Store name and through internet sites in North America, Western Europe, Japan and China. The stores are generally located in leading shopping malls and other retail complexes. The Company owns and operates approximately 200 stores in North America, approximately 60 permanent stores and 20 pop-up stores in Europe, approximately 50 stores in Japan and two stores in China. Internet sites are branded shopDisney and shopMarvel in the United States, shopDisney in Europe and store.Disney in Japan. The Company creates, distributes and publishes a variety of products in multiple countries and languages based on the Companys branded franchises. The products include childrens books, comic books, digital comics and ebooks, learning products and storytelling apps. The Company also operates Disney English, which develops and delivers an English language learning curriculum for Chinese children using Disney content in approximately 25 learning centers in six cities across China. Competition and Seasonality The Companys theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business compete with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, internet websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise. All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. The licensing, specialty retail, and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Companys first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases, and cable programming broadcasts. STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT Significant operations: ##TABLE_START  Motion picture production and distribution under the Walt Disney Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar, Fox Searchlight Pictures and Blue Sky Studios banners ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Development, production and licensing of live entertainment events on Broadway and around the world (stage plays) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Music production and distribution ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Post-production services, which include visual and audio effects through Industrial Light  Magic and Skywalker Sound ##TABLE_END Significant revenues: ##TABLE_START  Theatrical distribution - Rentals from licensing our motion pictures to theaters ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Home entertainment - Sale of our motion pictures to retailers and distributors in physical (DVD and Blu-ray) and electronic formats ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  TV/SVOD distribution and other - Licensing fees and other revenue from the right to use our motion picture productions, revenue from content transactions with other Company segments, ticket sales from stage plays, fees from licensing our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions, revenue from licensing our music, and revenue from post-production services ##TABLE_END Significant expenses: ##TABLE_START  Operating expenses consisting primarily of amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, distribution costs and costs of sales ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Selling, general and administrative costs ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization ##TABLE_END Prior to the Companys acquisition of Marvel in fiscal 2010, Marvel had licensed Spider-Man rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony). Sony incurs the costs to produce and distribute Spider-Man films, and the Company licenses the merchandise rights to third parties. The Company pays Sony a licensing fee based on each films box office receipts, subject to specified limits. The Company distributes all other Marvel-produced films with the exception of The Incredible Hulk , which is distributed by Universal Pictures. Theatrical Market We produce and distribute full-length live-action films and animated films. In the domestic theatrical market, we generally distribute and market our filmed products directly. In most major international markets, we distribute our filmed products directly while in other markets our films are distributed by independent companies or joint ventures. During fiscal 2020, we expect to release approximately 25 of our own produced feature films. Cumulatively through September 28, 2019 the Company has released approximately 1,000 full-length live-action features and 100 full-length animated features. The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the publics intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred, which may result in a loss on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film. Home Entertainment Market In the domestic market, we distribute home entertainment releases directly under each of our motion picture banners. In international markets, we distribute home entertainment releases under our motion picture banners both directly and through independent distribution companies. Domestic and international home entertainment distribution typically starts three to six months after the theatrical release in each market. Home entertainment releases are distributed in physical (DVD and Blu-ray) and electronic formats. Electronic formats may be released up to four weeks ahead of the physical release. Physical formats are generally sold to retailers, such as Walmart and Target and electronic formats are sold through e-tailers, such as Apple and Amazon. As of September 28, 2019 , we have approximately 2,400 active produced and acquired film titles, including 2,200 live-action titles and 200 animated titles, in the domestic home entertainment marketplace and approximately 2,300 active produced and acquired titles, including 2,000 live-action titles and 300 animated titles, in the international marketplace. Concurrently with physical home entertainment distribution, we license titles to video-on-demand service providers for electronic delivery to consumers for a specified rental period. Television Market In the television market, we license our films to cable and broadcast networks, television stations and other video service providers, which may provide the content to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices. The television market is comprised of multiple pay TV and free TV windows, which can have license periods of various lengths following the home entertainment window. In fiscal 2020, our Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar branded films will generally be licensed to DTCI for use on Disney+ after the theatrical and home entertainment windows. With the acquisition of TFCF, the Companys library of film titles available for distribution increased by approximately 2,000. Disney Music Group The Disney Music Group (DMG) commissions new music for the Companys motion pictures and television programs and develops, produces, markets and distributes the Companys music worldwide either directly or through license agreements. DMG also licenses the songs and recording copyrights to third parties for printed music, records, audio-visual devices, public performances and digital distribution and produces live musical concerts. DMG includes Walt Disney Records, Hollywood Records, Disney Music Publishing and Disney Concerts. Disney Theatrical Group Disney Theatrical Group develops, produces and licenses live entertainment events on Broadway and around the world, including The Lion King , Aladdin, Frozen , The Little Mermaid , Beauty and the Beast , The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mary Poppins (a co-production with Cameron Mackintosh Ltd), Newsies and TARZAN  . Disney Theatrical Group also licenses the Companys intellectual property to Feld Entertainment, the producer of Disney On Ice and Marvel Universe Live! . Competition and Seasonality The Studio Entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD programming services, produce music and sponsor live theater. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties and advertiser support that are essential to the success of our Studio Entertainment businesses. The success of Studio Entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, Studio Entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.

Our International Channels derive the majority of their revenues from advertising sales and affiliate fees. Generally, channels provide programming under multi-year agreements with MVPDs that include contractually determined rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our channels are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that a channel can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand. The Companys significant International Channels and the number of subscribers (in millions) based on internal management reports as of September 2019 is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Estimated Subscribers Disney  Disney Channel Disney Junior Disney XD ESPN (1) Fox (1) National Geographic (1) Star (1) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Reflects each unique subscriber that has access to one or more of these branded channels.

Based on internal management reports, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers as of September 2019 was approximately 29 million. Prior to the TFCF acquisition, the Company owned 30% of Hulu and reported Hulu as an equity investment. As a result of the acquisition, the Companys ownership interest in Hulu increased to 60%, and the Company started consolidating the results of Hulu. In May 2019, the Company increased its ownership interest in Hulu to 67%, with NBCU owning the remaining 33%.

(Vice), which is a media company that targets millennial audiences. Vice operates Viceland, which is owned 50% by A+E and 50% by Vice. Competition and Seasonality The Companys DTC and International Channel businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks, television stations and other media, such as online video services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines and billboards. The Companys International Channels face competition from other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Companys contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for distribution that are as favorable as those currently in place. The Companys DTC and International Channels also compete with other media and entertainment companies, SVOD providers and DTC services for the acquisition of sports rights, talent, show concepts, and scripted and other programming. Internet websites and digital products operated by the segment compete with other websites and entertainment products. Revenues fluctuate based on the timing of releases and performance of our digital media content, viewership levels on our cable channels and digital platforms, changes in subscriber levels and the demand for sports and other content. INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS Intersegment content transactions are presented gross (i.e. the segment producing the content reports revenue and profit from intersegment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on a separate Eliminations line when presenting a summary of our segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, except that intersegment sales of library content are generally recognized over time. Significant intersegment content transactions include the following: ##TABLE_START  Hulu licenses content from the Companys television studios through various arrangements including fixed and variable licensing fees and a percentage of addressable ad sales. Hulu also licenses the linear stream of our broadcast and cable channels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Disney+ and our International Channels license content from the Companys film and television studios. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our broadcast and cable channels license content from the Companys film studios. ##TABLE_END The Company defers profits on intersegment sales of content until the acquiring business expenses the content. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The Companys businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets.

We do not intend the address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this report. ", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. A decline in economic activity in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming or direct-to-consumer products. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our expansion plans. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets, or reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. Economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. Our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create filmed entertainment and television programming, which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home entertainment experiences. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, television programming, other content production, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air), affiliate fees, subscription fees, theatrical film receipts, the license of rights to other distributors, theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services, may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. The media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing DTC products for certain sports programming on ESPN+ (launched in 2018) and for filmed entertainment and other programming on Disney+ (launched in November 2019) and increasing our stake in Hulu (assumed full operational control in May 2019). There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes, and we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our existing business models. The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Companys operations worldwide, despite the Companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content. With respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification and exfiltration. We develop and maintain information security systems in an effort to prevent this, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Accordingly, despite our efforts, unauthorized access, modification and exfiltration of data cannot be eliminated entirely, and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees and/or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. An incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations. For example, events in Hong Kong have impacted profitability of our Hong Kong operations and may continue to do so there and elsewhere, and past hurricanes have impacted profitability of Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and future hurricanes may also do so. In addition, we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming, sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties, and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. As changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, expansion of our fleet of cruise ships and investments related to direct-to-consumer offerings. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. We face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. For example: ##TABLE_START  Our studio operations and media businesses compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks, SVOD providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our broadcast and cable networks and stations and direct-to-consumer offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our direct-to-consumer businesses compete for customers with competitors direct-to-consumer offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content. Competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. Competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services or deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. ##TABLE_END Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. We enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. Our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. These regulations include:  ##TABLE_START  U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1  Business  Media Networks, Federal Regulation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Environmental protection regulations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls. ##TABLE_END Changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable. For example, in January 2019 India implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels. Our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. Our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than U.S. law. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or United States anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law governed these operations. Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our business across segments and regions. Our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our segments, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners and culture may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands may impact our sales, business opportunities and profitability. Risks that impact our business as a whole may also impact the success of our direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. We may not successfully execute on our direct-to-consumer strategy. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC services, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. Poor quality broadband infrastructure in certain markets may impact our customers access to our DTC products and may diminish our customers experience with our DTC products. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses. Turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the Companys performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us. Labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. In addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. In general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. The seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. Each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings, including as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Revenues in our Media Networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns, changes in viewership levels and timing of program sales. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate fees are typically recognized ratably throughout the year. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted ASC 606, which changed the timing of affiliate revenue recognition for certain contracts, which may result in higher revenue in our first fiscal quarter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in increased revenues during the Companys first and fourth fiscal quarters. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. In addition, licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revenues in our Studio Entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Direct-to-Consumer  International revenues fluctuate based on: changes in subscriber levels; the timing and performance of releases of our digital media content; viewership levels on our cable channels and digital platforms; and the demand for sports and our content. Each of these may depend on the availability of content, which varies from time to time throughout the year based on, among other things, sports seasons and content production schedules. ##TABLE_END Accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. Sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. With approximately 223,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. The Alteration or Discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs. Certain of our interest rate derivatives and a portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR, which may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Such announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on the Company. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, the Companys borrowing costs may be adversely affected. Risk Factors Related to the TFCF Acquisition The TFCF acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The TFCF acquisition is not currently accretive to our earnings per share. Our expectations regarding the timeframe in which the TFCF acquisition may become accretive to our earnings per share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, may not be realized. In addition, we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the TFCF acquisition or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. Such factors could, combined with the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the TFCF acquisition, result in the TFCF acquisition continuing to be dilutive to our earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Although we expect that the TFCF acquisition will result in synergies and other benefits to us, we may not realize those benefits because of challenges inherently associated with integration, performance and the achievement of synergies. The Company and TFCF were operated independently until completion of the TFCF acquisition, and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. For a discussion of TFCFs contribution to the Company in fiscal 2019, see Managements Discussion and Analysis. If we are delayed or not able to successfully integrate TFCFs businesses with ours, pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy successfully, or realize the strategic value of the TFCF assets, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the TFCF acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be loss of key employees, loss of customers, disruption of ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-acquisition process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in the integration of TFCF businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the TFCF acquisition so the combined company performs as we hope: ##TABLE_START  combining the companies corporate functions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  combining the businesses of the Company and TFCF in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the TFCF acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the TFCF acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  maintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructure; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future. ##TABLE_END The TFCF acquisition was announced in December 2017 and closed March 2019, with integration activities currently ongoing. The pursuit of the TFCF acquisition, preparation for the integration of TFCF and integration of TFCF have placed a significant burden on our management and internal resources and the integration of TFCF may continue to do so. This may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company. Consummation of the TFCF acquisition has increased our exposure to the risks of operating internationally. We are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment, travel and consumer products worldwide. Although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the U.S., the combination with TFCF has increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. The risks of operating internationally that we face have increased following the completion of the TFCF acquisition. The TFCF acquisition and integration may result in additional costs and expenses. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the TFCF acquisition and integration. We may also incur accounting and other costs in the integration of the businesses of TFCF that were not anticipated at the time of the acquisition, including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future. Such costs could negatively impact the Companys free cash flow. Our consolidated indebtedness has increased substantially following completion of the TFCF acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility. Our consolidated indebtedness as of September 29, 2018 was approximately $20.9 billion. With the completion of the TFCF acquisition, our consolidated indebtedness as of September 28, 2019 was approximately $47.0 billion. The increased indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our financial flexibility may be further constrained by the issuance of shares of common stock in the TFCF acquisition, because of dividend payments. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

TFCF and Hulu's financial results have been consolidated since the date of acquisition and had a number of adverse impacts on fiscal 2019 results, the most significant of which were amortization expense related to recognition of TFCF and Hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs ( $0.74 per diluted share), an impact from shares issued upon the TFCF acquisition ($0.74 per diluted share), restructuring and impairment charges ($0.55 per diluted share) and TFCF and Hulu operating results ($0.27 per diluted share). Additional impacts included a non-cash gain from remeasuring our initial 30% interest in Hulu to fair value ( $2.22 per diluted share), equity investment impairments ($0.25 per diluted share) and a charge for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in the TFCF acquisition ( $0.24 per diluted share). Cash provided by continuing operating activities reflected payments for tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of Fox Corporation in connection with the TFCF acquisition and the sale of the RSNs acquired with TFCF and cash used in continuing investing activities reflected a cash payment of $35.7 billion paid to acquire TFCF, offset by the $25.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents assumed in the TFCF acquisition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Fiscal 2018 results include a net benefit from the Tax Act ( $1.11 per diluted share) and the benefit from a reduction in the Companys fiscal 2018 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate ( $0.75 per diluted share) (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, fiscal 2018 included gains on the sales of real estate and property rights ( $0.28 per diluted share) and an adverse impact from equity investment impairments ( $0.11 per diluted share). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Fiscal 2017 results include a non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech ( $0.10 per diluted share) (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Fiscal 2016 results include the Companys share of a net gain recognized by A+E in connection with an acquisition of an interest in Vice ( $0.13 per diluted share). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Fiscal 2015 results include the write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result of a recapitalization at Disneyland Paris ( $0.23 per diluted share). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  In fiscal 2015, the Company began paying dividends on a semiannual basis. Accordingly, fiscal 2015 includes dividend payments related to fiscal 2014 and the first half of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END", "7": " ITEM 7.

Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting guidance. Segment operating income for fiscal 2019 includes a $91 million benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the timing of recognition of TV/SVOD distribution revenue at Studio Entertainment. Further information about our adoption of ASC 606 is provided in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2019 vs. 2018 As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company acquired TFCF on March 20, 2019. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF, we acquired a controlling interest in Hulu. The Company began consolidating the results of TFCF and Hulu effective March 20, 2019. Revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 17% , or $10.1 billion , to $69.6 billion ; net income attributable to Disney decreased 12% , or $1.5 billion , to $11.1 billion ; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney (EPS) decreased 25% , or $2.09 to $6.27 . The decrease in EPS was due to the comparison to a benefit in fiscal 2018 from U.S. federal income tax legislation (Tax Act), which was enacted in fiscal 2018 (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), amortization expense on intangibles and the fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, an increase in shares outstanding and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF. The increase in shares outstanding was due to shares that were issued in connection with the acquisition of TFCF. Additionally, the decrease in EPS reflected lower segment operating income, which included a $0.5 billion adverse impact from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu in the current year, the absence of a gain recognized in the prior year on the sale of real estate, a charge in the current year for the extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a non-cash gain recognized in the current year in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hulu (Hulu Gain) (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Segment operating income from our legacy operations decreased due to higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer  International and lower results at Media Networks, partially offset by growth at Parks, Experiences and Products. Revenues Service revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 19% , or $9.7 billion , to $60.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulus operations and to a lesser extent, growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher guest spending at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, higher theatrical distribution revenue and growth in merchandise licensing. These increases were partially offset by lower ABC Studios program sales. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (Foreign Exchange Impact). Product revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5% , or $0.5 billion , to $9.0 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations and growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to guest spending growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Costs and expenses Cost of services for fiscal 2019 increased 32% , or $8.9 billion , to $36.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulus operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations reflected higher programming and production costs, labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts and an increase in film cost amortization. Cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Cost of products for fiscal 2019 increased 7% , or $0.4 billion , to $5.6 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations was due to higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise and labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment volumes. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2019 increased 30% , or $2.7 billion , to $11.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulus operations, and increases in marketing and compensation costs at our legacy operations. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Depreciation and amortization costs increased 38% , or $1.1 billion , to $4.2 billion due to amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of TFCF and consolidation of Hulu. Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $1.2 billion and $33 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2019 were due to severance in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF. Charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs.

In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the Company recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million and $38 million, respectively, in connection with the settlement of legal matters. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a charge of $511 million for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in TFCF acquisition. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a gain of $28 million on the deemed settlement of preexisting relationships with TFCF pursuant to acquisition accounting guidance. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded gains of $560 million in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights in New York City and a $3 million adjustment to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain of $255 million recorded in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech.

These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest and a benefit from market value adjustments on pay-floating interest rate swap options. The increase in interest income, investment income and other for the year was due to a $102 million benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and higher interest income on cash balances. The comparable benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs of $30 million in the prior year was reported in Costs and expenses. The benefit in the current year was due to the expected return on pension plan assets exceeding interest expense on plan liabilities and amortization of prior net actuarial losses. Equity in the Loss of Investees Equity in the loss of investees of $103 million was comparable to the prior year as higher impairments in the current year were offset by lower equity losses from Hulu as a result of our consolidation of Hulu following the TFCF acquisition. Effective Income Tax Rate  ##TABLE_START    Change Better/(Worse) Effective income tax rate - continuing operations 21.7 %  11.3 %  (10.4 ) ppt ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, of which the most significant impacts were a $1.7 billion net benefit (11 percentage points) that was recognized in the prior year, partially offset by a current year benefit from a reduction in the Companys U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 21% in fiscal 2019 from 24.5% in fiscal 2018. Noncontrolling Interests ##TABLE_START (in millions)    % Change Better/(Worse) Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests  $ (472 )  $ (468 )  (1 )%  ##TABLE_ENDNet income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was comparable to the prior year as the accretion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Hulu (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and a lower loss allocation to the noncontrolling interest holders of BAMTech were offset by a higher loss from our direct-to-consumer sports business. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs. 2018 vs. 2017 Revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 8% , or $4.3 billion , to $59.4 billion ; net income attributable to Disney increased 40% , or $3.6 billion , to $12.6 billion ; and EPS for the year increased 47% , or $2.67 to $8.36 . The EPS increase in fiscal 2018 was due to a benefit from the Tax Act, higher segment operating income, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and gains on the sale of real estate and property rights. These increases were partially offset by the comparison to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech, impairments of our Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments in fiscal 2018 and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. The increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our Studio Entertainment, Parks, Experiences and Products and Media Networks segments, partially offset by lower results at our Direct-to-Consumer  International segment. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Revenues Service revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9% , or $4.0 billion , to $50.9 billion , due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of BAMTech. In September 2017, the Company increased its ownership in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Product revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 3% , or $0.3 billion , to $8.6 billion , due to guest spending and volume growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Costs and expenses Cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased 9% , or $2.2 billion , to $27.5 billion , due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. Costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of BAMTech and higher costs at our theme parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. Cost of products for fiscal 2018 increased 4% , or $0.2 billion , to $5.2 billion due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased 8% , or $0.7 billion , to $8.9 billion , due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of BAMTech, costs incurred in connection with the TFCF acquisition and an increase in compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization costs increased 8% , or $0.2 billion , to $3.0 billion primarily due to depreciation of new attractions at our theme parks and resorts and the consolidation of BAMTech. Depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $33 million and $98 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs. Charges in fiscal 2017 were due to severance costs and asset impairments.

The decrease in interest and investment income for fiscal 2018 was due to the comparison to gains on investments recognized in fiscal 2017, partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher average interest rates. Equity in the income (loss) of investees, net Equity in the income of investees decreased $422 million , to a loss of $102 million due to higher losses from Hulu, impairments of Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments and lower income from A+E. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in fiscal 2017. The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. The decrease at A  +E was due to lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. Effective Income Tax Rate ##TABLE_START    Change Better/(Worse) Effective income tax rate 11.3 %  32.1 %  20.8 ppt ##TABLE_ENDThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, which included: ##TABLE_START  A net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate (Deferred Remeasurement), partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for a one-time tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings (Deemed Repatriation Tax). This benefit had an impact of approximately 11.5 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A reduction in the Companys fiscal 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in fiscal 2017. Net of state tax and other related effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 8.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. ##TABLE_END Noncontrolling Interests ##TABLE_START (in millions)    % Change Better/(Worse) Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests  $ (468 )  $ (386 )  (21 )%  ##TABLE_ENDNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 increased $82 million to $468 million due to lower tax expense at ESPN, largely due to the Tax Act, and the impact of the Companys acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Disneyland Paris in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. These increases were partially offset by losses at BAMTech.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses. Our Media Networks segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising (excluding addressable ad sales) and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programs. Significant expenses include amortization of programming and production costs, participations and residuals expense, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing intellectual properties and sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings. Our Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD markets, stage play ticket sales and licensing of our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions. Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales. Our Direct-to-Consumer  International segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising sales (includes addressable ad sales), subscription fees for our DTC streaming and other services, and fees charged for technology support services. Significant expenses include operating expenses, selling general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses include programming and production costs (including programming, production and branded digital content obtained from other Company segments), technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Companys portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.

The increase in advertising revenues was due to increase s of $374 million at Cable Networks, from $3,129 million to $3,503 million and $5 million at Broadcasting, from $3,457 million to $3,462 million . Cable Networks advertising revenue reflected increases of 11% from the consolidation of TFCFs operations and 2% from higher impressions reflecting higher units delivered, partially offset by lower average viewership. Broadcasting advertising revenue was comparable to the prior-year period as increases of 7% from higher network rates and 2% from the consolidation of TFCFs operations were offset by a decrease of 9% from average viewership. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $1,000 million , due to sales of TFCF programs, partially offset by a decrease in ABC Studios program sales. The decrease in ABC Studios program sales reflects the prior-year sales of Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist , partially offset by the current-year sale of The Punisher . Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $2,142 million from $12,555 million to $14,697 million . At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $1,255 million due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations and contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $887 million due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations, partially offset by the impact of lower ABC Studios program sales. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased from $1,899 million to $2,361 million due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 2%, or $141 million , to $7,479 million due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations, partially offset by lower income from ABC Studios program sales.

The decrease in attendance was due to lower attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. Attendance at our domestic theme parks was comparable to the prior year. Parks  Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to an increase of 6% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower volumes. The increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 2% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from an increase in average ticket prices for cruise line sailings and 1% from the consolidation of TFCF's operations. Merchandise licensing and retail revenue growth was due to increase s of 3% from merchandise licensing, 1% from our retail stores, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and 1% from our publishing business due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations. The increase in merchandise licensing revenues was primarily due to higher revenue from products based on Toy Story, an increase in guaranteed shortfall recognition and higher revenues from Avengers and Frozen merchandise. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from products based on Star Wars and Cars. Higher revenues at our retail stores were due to an increase in online sales. The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was due to the adoption of ASC 606 and higher real estate sales. The adoption of ASC 606 required certain cost reimbursements from licensees to be recognized as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses.

Per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2018 average foreign exchange rate. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $237 million from $5,937 million to $6,174 million , cost of sales and distribution costs, which increased $154 million from $2,764 million to $2,918 million , and infrastructure costs, which increased $99 million from $2,370 million to $2,469 million . The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, including the impact of wage increases for union employees, partially offset by the comparison to a special domestic employee bonus that was recognized in fiscal 2018. The increase in cost of sales and distribution costs was driven by higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts. Higher infrastructure costs were due to an increase in technology spending and costs for new guest offerings, including expenses associated with Star Wars: Galaxys Edge. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased $199 million , from $2,255 million to $2,454 million , due to the recognition of certain cost reimbursements from licensees as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $203 million from $2,930 million to $3,133 million primarily due to inflation and higher marketing spend at our parks and resorts. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 11% , or $663 million , to $6,758 million due to growth at our domestic theme parks and resorts and our consumer products businesses.

These increases were partially offset by two Marvel titles, Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel and no Star Wars title in the current year compared to four Marvel titles, Avengers: Infinity War , Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp , and two Star Wars titles, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Solo: A Star Wars Story in the prior year. The current year also included Toy Story 4 and Ralph Breaks the Internet , while the prior year included Incredibles 2 and Coco . Higher home entertainment revenue was due to an increase of 16% from the consolidation of TFCFs operations, partially offset by decreases of 9% from lower unit sales and 1% from a decrease in net effective pricing at our legacy operations. The decrease in unit sales was due to the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the prior year compared to no Star Wars release in the current year. Other significant titles in release included Avengers: Endgame , Incredibles 2 , Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp , and Ralph Breaks the Internet in the current year and Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok , Coco and Cars 3 in the prior year. Higher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to an increase of 14% from TV/SVOD distribution, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from Lucasfilms special effects business due to fewer projects. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution was due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include film cost amortization, which increase d $575 million , from $3,187 million to $3,762 million , due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $163 million , from $1,262 million to $1,425 million , due to the consolidation of TFCFs operations, partially offset by fewer projects at Lucasfilms special effects business.

Subscription fees and other revenue increased due to the consolidation of Hulus operations and, to a lesser extent, the consolidation of TFCF's international program sales and higher subscription fees for ESPN+, which launched in April 2018. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include an increase of $5,208 million in programming and production costs, from $1,572 million to $6,780 million , and an increase of $905 million in other operating expenses, from $812 million to $1,717 million . The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF's operations and, to a lesser extent, the ramp up of our investment in ESPN+ and the upcoming launch of Disney+. Other operating expenses, which include technical support and distribution costs, increased due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCFs operations. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $1,105 million , from $1,003 million to $2,108 million , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulus operations.

The decrease in advertising revenues was due to decrease s of $229 million at Cable Networks, from $3,358 million to $3,129 million and $123 million at Broadcasting, from $3,580 million to $3,457 million . The decrease at Cable Networks was due to a decrease of 6% from lower impressions as lower average viewership was partially offset by higher units delivered. The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 7% from lower network impressions and 2% from lower impressions at the owned television stations, both of which were driven by lower average viewership. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increase d $392 million due to higher ABC Studios program sales driven by increased revenue from programs licensed to Hulu and higher sales of Greys Anatomy and Black-ish. Additionally, fiscal 2018 included the sales of Luke Cage , Daredevil and Jessica Jones compared to fiscal 2017 sales of The Punisher and The Defenders . Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $486 million from $12,069 million to $12,555 million . At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increase d $317 million due to higher program sales and a higher average cost of network programming, including the impact of American Idol , Roseanne and The Goldbergs in fiscal 2018. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $169 million due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming, partially offset by lower production costs. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees decrease d $55 million from $766 million to $711 million due to lower income from A+E driven by decreased advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increase d 2% , or $142 million , to $7,338 million due to higher program sales and an increase at the Domestic Disney Channels, partially offset by lower income from equity investees.

Attendance growth included a favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew at Walt Disney World Resort. Parks  Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increase s of 5% from higher average guest spending, 3% from volume growth and 2% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Volume growth included a benefit from the favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew. The increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 3% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact, 1% from an increase in passenger cruise ship days and 1% from higher occupied hotel room nights. Higher occupied hotel room nights were due to an increase at our international resorts, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic resorts, reflecting fewer available room nights at Walt Disney World Resort due to room refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units. Merchandise licensing and retail revenues were lower primarily due to decrease s of 2% from licensing, 2% from lower retail sales and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in revenue from licensing was driven by a decrease in licensee settlements and lower revenues from products based on Frozen, Cars and Princess, partially offset by an increase from products based on Mickey and Minnie and Avengers. Lower retail revenue was driven by a decrease in comparable store sales at The Disney Stores, partially offset by higher online revenue. The decrease in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of Star Wars and Moana merchandise in the fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher sales of Mickey and Minnie merchandise. The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to an increase in real estate rental and sponsorship revenues. The following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: ##TABLE_START  Domestic  International (2)  Total  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017 Parks            Increase/ (decrease)            Attendance %  %  %  %  %  % Per Capita Guest Spending %  %  %  (1 )%  %  (1 )% Hotels (1)            Occupancy %  %  %  %  %  % Available Room Nights (in thousands) 10,045  10,205  3,179  3,022  13,224  13,227 Per Room Guest Spending $345  $317  $297  $289  $334  $311 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Resort statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis. Per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2017 average foreign exchange rate. ##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $525 million from $5,412 million to $5,937 million , cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $94 million from $2,670 million to $2,764 million and infrastructure costs, which increased $111 million from $2,259 million to $2,370 million . The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher volumes, an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. The increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to higher volumes and inflation. Higher infrastructure costs were driven by increased technology spending at our theme parks and resorts and inflation. Other operating expenses, which include costs such as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings increased $141 million from $2,114 million to $2,255 million due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, inflation and new guest offerings at our theme parks and resorts. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $34 million from $2,896 million to $2,930 million primarily due to inflation and higher technology spending, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. Depreciation and amortization increased $166 million from $2,161 million to $2,327 million primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and asset impairments in fiscal 2018. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 11% , or $608 million , to $6.1 billion due to growth at our domestic and international Parks  Experiences, partially offset by decreases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. The following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment to provide continuity with our legacy reporting: ##TABLE_START  Year Ended  % Change Better / (Worse) (in millions) September 29, 2018  September 30, 2017  Supplemental revenue detail      Parks  Experiences      Domestic $ 16,161  $ 14,812  % International 4,135  3,603  % Consumer Products 4,405  4,609  (4) %  $ 24,701  $ 23,024  % Supplemental operating income detail      Parks  Experiences      Domestic $ 4,013  $ 3,464  % International   % Consumer Products 1,626  1,713  (5) %  $ 6,095  $ 5,487  % ##TABLE_ENDStudio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Year Ended  % Change Better / (Worse) (in millions) September 29, 2018  September 30, 2017  Revenues       Theatrical distribution $ 4,303  $ 2,903  %  Home entertainment 1,647  1,677  (2 )%  TV/SVOD distribution and other 4,115  3,772  %  Total revenues 10,065  8,352  %  Operating expenses (4,449 )  (3,718 )  (20 )%  Selling, general, administrative and other (2,493 )  (2,156 )  (16 )%  Depreciation and amortization (119 )  (115 )  (3 )%  Operating Income $ 3,004  $ 2,363  %  ##TABLE_END Revenues The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the release of four Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles in fiscal 2017. The Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 were Avengers: Infinity War , Black Panther , Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp , whereas fiscal 2017 included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Doctor Strange . Other significant titles in fiscal 2018 included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Incredibles 2 and Coco , while fiscal 2017 included Beauty and the Beast, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Moana. Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5% decrease from lower unit sales, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average net effective pricing. Lower unit sales were driven by the success of Moana and Finding Dory in fiscal 2017 compared to Coco and Cars 3 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was also driven by three live-action titles in fiscal 2017 as compared to two live-action titles in fiscal 2018 and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the release of three Marvel titles and two Lucasfilm titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles and one Lucasfilm title in fiscal 2017. The increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of Blu-ray discs, partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected a 5% increase from TV/SVOD distribution and a 3% increase from stage plays. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by new international agreements and the sale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in fiscal 2018 with no comparable title in fiscal 2017. Higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in fiscal 2018. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include film cost amortization, which increase d $625 million , from $2,562 million to $3,187 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increase d $106 million , from $1,156 million to $1,262 million . Higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues. Higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage play production and theatrical distribution costs. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $337 million from $2,156 million to $2,493 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in fiscal 2018. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increase d 27% , or $641 million to $3,004 million due to an increase in theatrical distribution results. Direct-to-Consumer  International Operating results for the Direct-to-Consumer  International segment are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Year Ended  % Change Better / (Worse) (in millions) September 29, 2018  September 30, 2017  Revenues       Affiliate fees $ 1,372  $ 1,335  %  Advertising 1,311  1,293  %  Subscription fees and other   %  Total revenues 3,414  3,075  %  Operating expenses (2,384 )  (1,983 )  (20 )%  Selling, general, administrative and other (1,003 )  (861 )  (16 )%  Depreciation and amortization (185 )  (94 )  (97 )%  Equity in the income of investees (580 )  (421 )  (38 )%  Operating Income $ (738 )  $ (284 )  (100 )%  ##TABLE_ENDRevenues The increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 5% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Advertising revenue increase d 1% as higher addressable ad sales were largely offset by lower revenue generated from content distributed on YouTube. Other revenue increase d $284 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. In fiscal 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. The Companys share of BAMTechs results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included a $147 million increase in programming and production costs, from $1,425 million to $1,572 million and a $254 million increase in other operating expenses, from $558 million to $812 million . The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower talent costs for digital programming. Other operating costs, which include technical support and distribution costs, increase d due to the consolidation of BAMTech. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $142 million from $861 million to $1,003 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower marketing costs at our International Channels. Depreciation and amortization increase d $91 million from $94 million to $185 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. Equity in the Loss of Investees Loss from equity investees increase d $159 million from a loss of $421 million to a loss of $580 million primarily due to a higher loss from our investment in Hulu, partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in fiscal 2017. On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. The Companys share of BAMTechs results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees. The higher loss at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss increase d $454 million , to $738 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech and a higher loss from Hulu, partially offset by growth at our International Channels.

RESTRUCTURING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF TFCF As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF the Company has begun implementing a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF. During fiscal 2019, we recorded charges of $1.2 billion , including $0.9 billion of severance and related costs in connection with the plan and $0.3 billion of equity-based compensation costs, primarily for TFCF awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the TFCF acquisition. These charges are recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although our plans are not yet finalized, we anticipate that the total severance and related costs could be on the order of $1.5 billion. The Company may incur other restructuring costs, such as contract termination costs, but we expect these will not be material. For fiscal 2018, restructuring and impairment charges were not material. The following table summarizes the changes in restructuring reserves related to TFCF integration efforts in fiscal 2019: ##TABLE_START  Beginning Balance  Additions  Payments  Other  Ending Balance Restructuring reserves $   $  $ (230 )  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS In November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming in the U.S. and four other countries. Further launches are planned for Western Europe in spring 2020, Latin America in fall 2021, Eastern Europe starting in late 2020 and continuing in 2021, and various Asia-Pacific territories throughout 2020 and 2021. As we will use our branded film and television content on the Disney+ service, we expect to forgo licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. In addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for Disney+. Due to the circumstances in Hong Kong, we have seen a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. If current trends continue, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort's fiscal 2020 operating income could decrease by approximately $275 million compared to fiscal 2019. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Cash provided by operations - continuing operations  $ 5,984  $ 14,295  $ 12,343 Cash used in investing activities - continuing operations  (15,096 )  (5,336 )  (4,111 ) Cash used in financing activities - continuing operations  (464 )  (8,843 )  (8,959 ) Cash provided by operations - discontinued operations      Cash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations  10,978     Cash used in financing activities - discontinued operations  (626 )     Impact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  (98 )  (25 )  Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  $ 1,300  $  $ (696 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating Activities Continuing operations Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 decreased 58% or $8.3 billion to $6.0 billion compared to fiscal 2018 due to the payment of approximately $7.6 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of Fox Corporation in connection with the TFCF acquisition and the sale of the RSNs acquired with TFCF, higher pension plan contributions and higher interest payments. Lower operating cash flows at our DTCI and Media Networks segments were largely offset by increases at Parks, Experiences and Products and Studio Entertainment. The decreases at DTCI and Media Networks were due to higher film and television spending and operating disbursements, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increases at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products were due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increase at Studio Entertainment was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. The increase at Parks, Experiences and Products was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by cost inflation and higher marketing expenses. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16% or $2.0 billion to $14.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the Tax Act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products, partially offset by lower operating cash flows at Media Networks and DTCI and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in New York. The increase in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. Parks, Experiences and Products cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs. Lower operating cash flow at Media Networks was due to higher television production spending. The decrease in operating cash flow at DTCI was due to higher operating cash disbursements. Depreciation expense is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Media Networks       Cable Networks  $  $  $ Broadcasting    Total Media Networks    Parks, Experiences and Products       Domestic  1,474  1,449  1,371 International    Total Parks, Experiences and Products  2,198  2,217  2,050 Studio Entertainment    Direct-to-Consumer  International    Corporate    Total depreciation expense  $ 2,837  $ 2,758  $ 2,586 ##TABLE_ENDAmortization of intangible assets is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Media Networks  $   $   $  Parks, Experiences and Products    Studio Entertainment    Direct-to-Consumer  International    TFCF and Hulu  1,043     Total amortization of intangible assets  $ 1,323  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and DTCI segments incur costs to acquire and produce feature film and television programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for use on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, television stations or DTC services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability. The Companys film and television production and programming activity related to continuing operations for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Beginning balances:       Production and programming assets  $ 9,202  $ 8,759  $ 7,547 Programming liabilities  (1,178 )  (1,106 )  (1,063 )   8,024  7,653  6,484 Spending:       Television program licenses and rights  10,517  7,770  7,406 Film and television production  7,104  5,590  5,319   17,621  13,360  12,725 Amortization:       Television program licenses and rights  (10,608 )  (7,966 )  (7,595 ) Film and television production  (6,471 )  (4,871 )  (4,055 )   (17,079 )  (12,837 )  (11,650 ) Change in film and television production and programming costs    1,075 Film and television production costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, net of programming liabilities assumed  14,227     Other non-cash activity   (152 )  Ending balances:       Production and programming assets  27,407  9,202  8,759 Programming liabilities  (4,061 )  (1,178 )  (1,106 )   $ 23,346  $ 8,024  $ 7,653 ##TABLE_ENDDiscontinued operations Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs. Investing Activities Continuing operations Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Media Networks       Cable Networks  $  $  $ Broadcasting    Parks, Experiences and Products       Domestic  3,294  3,223  2,392 International    Studio Entertainment    Direct-to-Consumer  International    Corporate      $ 4,876  $ 4,465  $ 3,623 ##TABLE_ENDCapital expenditures for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort, partially offset by lower spending on new attractions at Disneyland Resort, while the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, including Star Wars: Galaxys Edge. The increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending at Disneyland Paris, while the decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. Capital expenditures at DTCI primarily reflect investments in technology. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on technology to support our DTC services. Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was driven by investments in corporate facilities. The Company currently expects its fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of $4.9 billion due to increased spending on technology and facilities at DTCI and Corporate. Other Investing Activities The fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire TFCF less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to Hulu prior to the consolidation of Hulu. The fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the September 2017 acquisition of an additional 42% of BAMTech. Cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million in fiscal 2018 reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to Hulu. The fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the January 2017 acquisition of additional interests in BAMTech net of cash assumed upon the consolidation of BAMTech. Cash used in other investing activities of $71 million in fiscal 2017 reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions. Discontinued operations Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the RSNs. Financing Activities Continuing operations Cash used in financing activities was $ 0.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $ 8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 . The net use of cash in the current year was due to $2.9 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from borrowing of $3.7 billion . The decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to a net increase in borrowings in the current year compared to net repayments in the prior year ($3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018) and the absence of common stock repurchases in the current year (compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018), partially offset by acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in the current year ($1.4 billion in fiscal 2019). Cash used in financing activities was $ 8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017 . The net use of cash in fiscal 2018 was due to $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion . Cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases ( $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in fiscal 2017 ) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2018 compared to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2017 ( $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 compared to $3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2017 ). Discontinued operations Cash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the RSNs. Borrowings activities and other During the year ended September 28, 2019 , the Companys borrowing activity was as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  September 29, 2018  Borrowings  Payments  Borrowings Assumed in Acquisition of TFCF  Other Activity  September 28, 2019 Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months (1)  $  $ 1,881  $   $   $  $ 1,934 Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months   6,889  (4,452 )     3,408 U.S. dollar denominated notes  18,045  6,930  (7,044 )  21,174   39,424 Asia Theme Parks borrowings  1,145    (47 )     1,114 Foreign currency denominated debt and other (2)    (690 )    1,106 Credit facilities to acquire TFCF    31,100  (31,100 )         20,874  47,010  (43,333 )  21,723   46,986 Liabilities held for sale (3)     (68 )  1,069  (1,051 )     $ 20,874  $ 47,060  $ (43,401 )  $ 22,792  $ (339 )  $ 46,986 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The other activity is due to the sale of the RSNs in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Companys dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 28, 2019 , Moodys Investors Services long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poors long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, and Fitchs long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F1, respectively. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 28, 2019 , by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 28, 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table:  ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period (in millions)  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  4-5 Years  More than 5 Years Borrowings (Note 9) (1)  $ 65,888  $ 10,398  $ 10,021  $ 6,516  $ 38,953 Operating lease commitments (Note 15)  5,931   1,519   2,491 Capital lease obligations (Note 15)      Sports programming commitments (Note 15)  43,940  8,878  15,613  9,315  10,134 Broadcast programming commitments (Note 15)  6,474  2,599  2,277   Total sports and other broadcast programming commitments  50,414  11,477  17,890  10,261  10,786 Other (2)   12,918  3,210  3,292  2,218  4,198 Total contractual obligations (3)  $ 135,700  $ 26,086  $ 32,761  $ 19,967  $ 56,886 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Excludes market value adjustments, which reduce recorded borrowings by $31 million .

Legal and Tax Matters As disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Film and Television Revenues and Costs We produce films and television series for distribution in the theatrical and television markets and on our DTC streaming services. We expense the production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g. the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on an accelerated or straight-line basis over the useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. We also acquire, license and produce films and television series for our direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. We expense these costs based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, which may be on an accelerated or straight-line basis, as appropriate. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. For film and television series that are exploited on our direct-to-consumer streaming services, the unamortized costs are reviewed for impairment on an aggregate basis for each service. Fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and motion picture productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee. TV/SVOD distribution contracts may contain more than one title and/or provide that certain titles are only available for use during defined periods of time during the contract term. In these instances, each title and/or period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation. For these contracts, license fees are allocated to each title and period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management's best estimate. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation's standalone selling price impact the timing of revenue recognition, but not the total revenue to be recognized under the arrangements. Revenue Recognition The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. We have updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We reduced our discount rate to 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 from 4.31% at the end of fiscal 2018 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2019 year-end measurement date. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $313 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2019 by approximately $3.6 billion . A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $273 million and $3.0 billion , respectively. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25% . A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $157 million . Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. In addition, the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. The Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment. The impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material. For fiscal 2019, the fair value of our International Channels reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by less than 10%. Our International Channels reporting unit comprises the Companys international cable networks that provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs. A majority of the operations in this reporting unit consist of businesses acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value approximates carrying value. Goodwill of this reporting unit is approximately $3 billion. Changes to key assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record an impairment charge. The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company tested its investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $538 million and $210 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in Equity in the income (loss) of investees, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fiscal 2017 impairment charges recorded were not material. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. Income Tax Audits As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. The acquisition of TFCF increased the Companys uncertain tax benefits as the Company assumed the tax liabilities of TFCF. The Company is still obtaining information related to the evaluation of the income tax impact of certain pre-acquisition transactions of TFCF which may result in adjustments to the recorded amount of uncertain tax benefits. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A  Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. Policies and Procedures In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Companys portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel, oil and gasoline. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. Value at Risk (VAR) The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Companys computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Companys debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. VAR on a combined basis increased to $322 million at September 28, 2019 from $44 million at September 29, 2018 driven by an increase in borrowings and higher interest rate volatility of our debt. The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):  ##TABLE_START Fiscal 2019  Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments  Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments  Equity Sensitive Financial Instruments  Commodity Sensitive Financial Instruments  Combined Portfolio Year end fiscal 2019 VAR  $317  $28  $1  $2  $322 Average VAR      Highest VAR      Lowest VAR      Year end fiscal 2018 VAR      ##TABLE_ENDThe VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of September 28, 2019 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.
