Business ##TABLE_END Overview Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments in more than 200 countries and territories, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. Our business primarily consists of the following: ##TABLE_START    we own, manage and promote a portfolio of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including Visa, Visa Electron, PLUS and Interlink, which we license to our clients for use in their payment programs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we offer a wide range of branded payments product platforms, which our clients, primarily financial institutions, use to develop and offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for their customers (individuals, businesses and government entities); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we provide transaction processing and value-added services to our clients through VisaNet, Visa Debit Processing Services and Visa Processing Services; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we promote and enforce a common set of operating regulations adhered to by our clients to ensure the efficient and secure functioning of our payments network and the maintenance and promotion of our brands. ##TABLE_END To ensure our long-term success and the success of our clients: ##TABLE_START    we invest in new services and processing platforms to facilitate more convenient and innovative payment methods, such as mobile payments, money transfer and eCommerce; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we continually improve the security of our network and our payments services to enhance the reliability of our global processing infrastructure and protect the security of cardholder information. ##TABLE_END We operate an open-loop payments network, a multi-party system in which Visa connects financial institutionsissuing financial institutions (or issuers) that issue cards to cardholders, and acquiring financial institutions (or acquirers) that have the banking relationship with merchants  and manage the exchange of information and value between them. As such, Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. In most instances, cardholder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our network of financial institution clients. We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services that we provide. Business developments in fiscal 2010 included the following: ##TABLE_START    CyberSource. We completed the acquisition of CyberSource Corporation in July 2010. CyberSource provides payment and risk solutions to online businesses, expanding Visas online payment, fraud, and security management capabilities. The combination of our businesses is expected to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category and enhance the value of Visas network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Client Contracts. We continued to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth by successfully renewing several major client contracts throughout the year. We now have no major contracts up for renewal until the beginning of fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Economic Recovery . The global economic recovery drove double-digit growth across our three primary revenue driverspayments volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactionswhich contributed to our 17% year-over-year total operating revenues gain for fiscal 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Sponsorships. We sponsored our first FIFA World Cup, held June-July 2010, as part of our overall FIFA sponsorship which extends through 2014. We also launched our first global Olympic marketing campaign, Go World, in November 2009 in advance of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. This followed shortly after we announced an eight-year extension of the Olympic Games sponsorship we have had in place since 1986, enabling us to remain the exclusive payment services sponsor through 2020. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation . New regulation affecting the payments industry and our financial institution clients was adopted in several important jurisdictions. Of note this fiscal year, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in the United States on July 21, 2010, which will, amongst other things, regulate interchange fees and transaction routing rules related to our debit card products. See Government Regulation below. ##TABLE_END Industry Overview The Global Payments Industry We operate in the global payments industry, which is undergoing a powerful secular shift towards card-based and other electronic payments and away from paper-based payments, such as cash and checks. For more than 50 years, Visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers, businesses, governments and merchants. We believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms. We also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency, control and security, and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience. The global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer, including: ##TABLE_START    paper-based paymentscash, personal checks, money orders, government checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    card-based paymentscredit cards, charge cards, debit cards, deferred debit cards, ATM cards, prepaid cards, private label cards and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    mobile paymentselectronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications such as text messages, mobile billing, web browsers or applications, contactless readers, or other means; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    other electronic paymentswire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house payments and other forms of electronic payment not typically tied to a payment card or similar access device. ##TABLE_END The most common card-based forms of payment are general-purpose cards, which offer widespread merchant acceptance. General purpose cards are typically categorized as: ##TABLE_START    pay now cards, such as debit cards, which enable the cardholder to purchase goods and services by an automatic debit to a checking, demand deposit or other current account; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pay later cards, such as credit, deferred debit and charge cards, which typically permit a cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit or deferred debit account or require payment of the full balance within a specified period; and ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    pay before cards, such as prepaid cards, which are pre-funded up to a certain monetary value. ##TABLE_END Primary global general purpose card brands include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club. While these brandsincluding Visawere historically associated with consumer credit or charge cards in the United States and other major international markets, Visa and others have, over time, broadened their offerings to include debit, ATM, prepaid and commercial cards. Our Core Operations We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services we provide. Our clients deliver Visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on product platforms we define and manage. Payments network management is a core part of our operations, as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe, efficient, consistent and interoperable service to cardholders, merchants and financial institutions worldwide. Transaction Processing Services Processing Infrastructure We own and operate VisaNet, which consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including a new east coast data center in the United States. In addition, Visa Europe operates one processing center in the United Kingdom, which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. These centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. Intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added information, such as risk scoring or loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our system. CyberSource, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc., operates multiple data centers in the United States and internationally. These secure data center facilities allow for high availability transaction services and connectivity to the Internet, clients and processing partners. Core Processing Services Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between Visa issuers and acquirers. In addition, we offer a range of value-added processing services to support our clients Visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the Visa payments network. Authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed. Clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholders account, the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction, and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies. Settlement is the process of calculating, determining, reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared. The issuer and acquirer involved in a typical Visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor. For example, the acquirer credits the merchants account for the  amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer. In addition, the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment, in the case of a credit or deferred debit card, or collects payment directly from the cardholders deposit account, in the case of a debit card. We process most Visa transactions occurring in the United States. We also process most Visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries, referred to as cross-border transactions. In many countries outside the United States, domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems, generally by government-controlled payments networks, our clients, independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients. We perform clearing and settlement through VisaNet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in Visa Europes region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world, or vice versa. In addition, we provided clearing and settlement services for Visa transactions occurring entirely within Visa Europes region before Visa Europe substantially deployed its own processing system in fiscal 2010. The impact to our consolidated financial results as a result of this deployment was not material. Visa Europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system. Other Value-Added Processing Services We offer a range of other value-added services in certain countries, including risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services. Risk Management Services . We provide clients in certain countries with a number of value-added risk-management services. These services, including Visa Advanced Authorization, include preventive, monitoring, investigative and predictive tools, which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level. Issuer Processing Services. Visa Debit Processing Services (DPS) provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating U.S. issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. In addition to core issuer authorization processing, DPS offers card management services, exception processing, PIN and ATM network gateways, call center services, fraud detection services and ATM terminal driving. Visa Processing Service (VPS) provides credit, debit and prepaid issuer processing services, including multicurrency processing functionality, outside the United States. Loyalty Services . We offer loyalty services, such as the Visa Incentive Network and Visa Extras, which allow our clients to differentiate their Visa program offerings, enhance the attractiveness of their Visa payment programs and strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants. Dispute Management Services . We manage Visa Resolve Online, an automated web-based service that allows our clients back-office analysts and client service representatives to manage and resolve Visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with paper-based processes. Value-Added Information Services . We provide our clients with a range of additional information-based business analytics and applications, as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them. Additionally, through our CyberSource-branded solutions, we provide technology and services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud, and safeguard payment security online. CyberSource brings these payment management solutions to market on two platforms: CyberSource Enterprise services, targeting medium and large-sized enterprise businesses, and Authorize.Net, targeting smaller businesses with less than $3 million in annual online sales.  Product Platforms We offer a broad range of product platforms that enable our clients to build differentiated, competitive payment programs for their consumer, business, government and merchant clients. Our principal payment platforms enable credit, charge, deferred debit, debit and prepaid payments, as well as cash access for consumers, businesses and government entities. Our payment platforms are offered under our Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Consumer Credit Our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments. Our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as Visa Classic. In addition, we offer premium credit platforms. These enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits, such as loyalty programs. Our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers, and in some cases, to cardholders, as Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Signature Preferred and Visa Infinite. Consumer Deposit Access Our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw on consumers deposit accounts, such as checking, demand deposit, asset or other pre-funded accounts. Consumer Debit . Our primary consumer debit platform in the United States and many other countries uses the Visa brand mark. Our clients in Asia Pacific (AP), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA), can use the Visa Electron debit platform, which requires all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically. It is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher risk client segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less prevalent. In the United States, we also provide the Interlink debit product platform, which generally requires a cardholder to enter a personal identification number (PIN), for authentication. Interlink may be enabled through an acceptance mark on a Visa debit card or issued as a standalone debit card. Prepaid. Our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a pre-funded account, allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. Our prepaid platform includes gift, travel, youth, payroll, money transfer, corporate incentive, insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards. Cash Access. Our clients can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at Visa and PLUS branded ATMs. Most Visa and Visa Electron branded cards offer cash access at ATMs, as well as at branches of our participating financial institution clients. The PLUS brand may also be included on issuers non-Visa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services. Commercial Our commercial product platforms enable small businesses, medium and large companies, and government organizations to streamline payment processes, manage total spend, access information reporting, automate their supply chain and reduce administrative costs. Small Businesses . The Visa Business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools, purchasing savings, rewards and management reporting. Visa Business Electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside North America.  Large and Medium Companies. The Visa Corporate platform offers payment options primarily for employee travel and entertainment charges, including cash advances, and provides detailed transaction data as well as information and expense management tools. The Visa Purchasing platform provides card and non-card electronic payment products that allow companies to easily procure goods and services, while streamlining resource- and paper-intensive purchase order and invoice processing. Through Syncada, our joint venture with US Bank, we market an integrated invoice processing, payment and financing platform for financial institutions to offer to their corporate and government commercial clients around the world. Government Organizations. In addition to the products mentioned above, Visa offers government organizations unique information-and expense-management tools, employee-fraud-and misuse-management tools and strategic sourcing tools for their card programs. In certain countries, Visa offers specialized commercial products for specific government-sponsored programs, typically targeting agriculture, small-business, freight or construction loan programs. Product Platform Innovation Our fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms and extending the utility of our products and services to new merchant segments and geographies. We invest in innovation because we believe we can drive more secure, accessible and versatile payment program options for clients, merchants and consumers. We focus on new payment channels, card technologies, payment account access devices and authentication methods, and have recently made significant investments in the development of: eCommerce payment platforms; contact and contactless chip cards and devices; card product enhancements; authentication and security technologies and platforms; and money transfer. In addition to the eCommerce (CyberSource) development mentioned above, we announced the following innovative offerings: ##TABLE_START    we launched an online shopping tool in the U.S., Rightcliq by Visa, which improves the way consumers browse and compare products, checkout on merchant websites, and track packages to their doorstep. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    working with Bancomer Transfer Services, Inc., a subsidiary of BBVA Bancomer, S.A., we launched a money transfer service that will provide an alternative for consumers that send money from the U.S. to select countries in Latin America and Asia. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we partnered with DeviceFidelity to launch a solution that combines Visas contactless payment technology, Visa payWave, and DeviceFidelitys In2Pay technology to transform a mobile phone with a microSD memory slot into a mobile contactless payment device. ##TABLE_END Payments Network Management We devote significant resources to ensure that Visa is the payments network of choice for clients, merchants and cardholders. We seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities, increasing acceptance of Visa cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants. Brand Management and Promotion, and Corporate Reputation We engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, taking a targeted, analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives. We combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, public relations and, increasingly, social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand, promote product  usage, increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention. For merchants, we work to ensure that the Visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment, as well as a way to increase sales. For our clients, our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. We establish global marketing relationships to promote the Visa brand and to allow clients to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events. For instance, we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor for the Olympic Games since 1986 and recently extended the sponsorship through 2020. We are also one of six FIFA partners, which provides us with worldwide exclusive access to the FIFA World Cup and more than 40 other FIFA competitions through 2014. This sponsorship creates a powerful opportunity to drive business, achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift, global reach and local relevance. In addition, we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional, national and local companies, sports leagues or events, such as the National Football League in the United States, or with associations and companies, to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions. Our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments. These programs, which we develop in conjunction with merchants, generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions. In addition, we work on various fronts to maintain, enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand. Our Corporate Responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities. We do so by focusing on promoting financial literacy and inclusion, providing humanitarian aid and community support, and engaging in responsible business practices. We continue to stress the importance of promoting an understanding of Visas role as a payments network and articulating the ways that digital currency can advance economic empowerment and business efficiencies. To that end, Currency of Progress, our corporate reputation campaign launched in October 2009, communicates the tangible benefits that Visa and digital currency delivers to individuals, businesses, governments and economies. Merchant Acceptance Initiatives We aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fast-growing segments, such as bill payment. Our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations, delivering value-added information services, such as the Visa Incentive Network, and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment. For example, in October 2010 we began offering a global program that enables millions of face-to-face merchants to accept Visa cards for transactions of approximately US$25 or less without requiring a cardholder signature, PIN or providing a receipt, unless requested by the cardholder. This program has the potential to increase speed at the point-of-sale, enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants. We also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards. Client Standards Rulemaking and Enforcement. In general, our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems. Our clients are obligated to honor our rules and  standards through agreements with, and in certain cases non-equity membership interests in, our subsidiaries. These rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks; the standards, design and features of payment cards, devices and programs; merchant acquiring activities, including acceptance standards applicable to merchants; use of agents; disputes between members; risk management; guaranteed settlement; client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients. We establish dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions. For example, after a transaction is presented to an issuer, the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons, including fraud. If the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction, the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer, an action termed a chargeback. We enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes. Credit Risk Management. We indemnify our clients for any settlement loss suffered due to another clients failure to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. No material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years. To manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations, we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures. We regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk. In certain instances, we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees. If a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss. We may also apply other risk control measures, such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions, limiting the use of certain types of agents, prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high-risk merchants or suspending or terminating a clients rights to participate in our payments network. The exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model. Key inputs to the model include the probability of clients becoming insolvent, statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end. Payment System Integrity The integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products. Fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or card-not-present transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data, including systems operated by merchants, financial institutions and other third-party data processors. Our fraud detection and prevention offerings include: ##TABLE_START    Verified by Visa, a global Internet authentication product, which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Visa Advanced Authorization, which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding real-time risk scores to authorization messages; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Chip technologies that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of counterfeit card fraud at point-of-sale locations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    CyberSources globally proven Decision Manager solution, which provides access to over 200 validation tests to assess the legitimacy of card-not-present orders. ##TABLE_END  We work with all participants in the payment system to ensure any entity that transmits, processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders. For example, Visa mandates protection of PIN data through use of the Triple Data Encryption Standard and works with the payments industry to manage the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). There has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of PCI DSS with more than 95 percent of the largest U.S. merchants validating compliance annually. Interchange Reimbursement Fees Interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system. We set default interchange rates in the United States and other regions. In certain jurisdictions, interchange rates are subject to government regulation. Although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, we do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees. Interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest single component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards. We believe that default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value, and promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it, and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other. By establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands, we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the Visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and, ultimately, consumers and merchants. We believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers, merchants, our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment, and by creating incentives for innovation, enhanced data quality and security. Interchange reimbursement fees and related practices have come to the attention of, or have been or are being reviewed by, regulatory authorities and/or central banks in a number of jurisdictions, including, for example, Australia, Canada, Brazil and South Africa. In the United States in particular, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010 and will impact interchange fees related to debit card products. We are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange reimbursement fee practices in these geographies. See Item 1ARisk FactorsInterchange reimbursement fees and related practices are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide, and resulting regulations may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 22Legal Matters elsewhere in this report. Merchant Discount Rates . Merchants do not pay interchange reimbursement fees. A merchants cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate. The merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in open-loop payments networks, including those relating to interchange, and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants. Merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers, other payment card systems and other forms of payment. We do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers.  Government Regulation General . Government regulation affects key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used. Our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and consequently such regulations affect our business. In recent years, our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. Network Exclusivity and Routing. Issues relating to network exclusivity and to interchange fees associated with open-loop payments systems such as ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used. Most notably, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act recently enacted in the United States includes provisions that will regulate the selection of payment networks by issuers and the routing of debit transactions by retailers. This may result in the routing of debit transactions onto competitive networks, potentially reducing the processing fees we earn on debit transactions. Interchange Fees . The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also established regulation and oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices. In addition, the Federal Reserve now has the power to regulate network fees to the extent necessary to prevent evasion of the new rules on interchange rates. Although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange reimbursement fees. Interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards. Interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume. Interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities and/or central banks in a number of jurisdictions. Most notably: ##TABLE_START    The Reserve Bank of Australia, or RBA, has promulgated regulations under legislation enacted to give it powers over payments systems. One of the regulations controls the costs that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fees for Visa credit and debit cards, but it does not regulate the merchant discount charged by any payment system, including competing closed-loop payments systems. The RBA has concluded that conditions have not yet been met for removal of interchange regulation and so will continue regulatory oversight of interchange. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In June 2009, the Canadian Senate issued a report with the non-binding recommendations that debit interchange be set at zero for three years, that merchant surcharging be permitted in Canada and that rules requiring that Visa-accepting merchants honor all cards be modified. Canadas Competition Bureau has opened a civil inquiry to review interchange and certain Visa rules, including those relating to surcharging and honoring cards. In addition, the Canadian Ministry of Finance has proposed a voluntary Code of Conduct on related issues for payment card industry participants in Canada. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    In March 2009, the Central Bank of Brazil issued a joint report that criticized, amongst other things, Brazils current acquiring structure, Visas no-surcharge rule, and the current system of setting interchange rates. See also Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. ##TABLE_END Data Protection and Information Security . Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy regulation in the United States and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, our clients and we are respectively subject to Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Federal Trade Commissions  information safeguarding rules require us to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of any cardholder information at issue. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. As part of their compliance with the requirements, each of our U.S. clients is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, cardholder information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to cardholders. In addition, a large number of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism . Most jurisdictions in which our clients and we operate have implemented, amended or have pending anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism regulations. We are subject to the provisions of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, which requires the creation and implementation of comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. In general, this requires that we make certain efforts to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, including, for example, the designation of a compliance officer, training of employees, adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks, and periodic audits. We are also subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, restricting financial dealings with Cuba, Iran, Myanmar and Sudan, as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties, such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers. While we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being Visa members, many Visa International members are non-U.S. financial institutions, and thus are not subject to OFAC restrictions. Accordingly, our payments network may be used with respect to transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions. Further, certain U.S. states have enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries identified as terrorist-sponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states. As a result, pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments. Issuer Practice Legislation and Regulation . The Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System is in the process of implementing the Credit CARD Act enacted in May 2009. The Credit CARD Act will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our clients and on our clients account terms and business practices. The Credit CARD Act and its implementing regulations will make it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit cards for future credit risk and will have a significant effect on the pricing, credit allocation, and business models of most major credit card issuers. The law could reduce credit availability, or increase the cost of credit to cardholders, possibly affecting Visa transaction volume and revenues. The Credit CARD Act also includes provisions that impose limits and restrictions on certain prepaid (or pay before) card products, including those imposed on fees. The statutory provisions and implementing regulations may diminish the attractiveness of these products to our clients and may consequently adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues. The Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System has also adopted regulations on overdraft fees imposed in connection with ATM and debit card transactions. These regulations will have the effect of significantly reducing overdraft fees our clients may charge in connection with debit card programs. This may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our clients and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues.  Governments in certain countries have acted, or could act, to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors, to displace us from, or prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies. For example, our financial institution clients in China may not issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in China. Governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time. Financial Industry Regulation. The U.S. Federal Financial Institution Examination Council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the United States to ensure our compliance with applicable data integrity and security requirements, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. In recent years, the federal banking regulators in the United States have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting, greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities, particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders. In the United States, regulators and the U.S. Congress have increased their scrutiny of our clients pricing and underwriting standards relating to credit. For example, a number of regulations have been issued to implement the U.S. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. One such regulation pertaining to risk-based pricing could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards and result in increased costs of issuance and/or a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit. The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Federal Reserve System. The bureau will assume responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and will have new authorities with respect to consumer issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The creation of the bureau and its actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers. Government regulators may determine that we are a systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk management requirements on us, including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for client participation and merchant access to our payments system. In addition, outside of the United States, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems. For example, regulators in Australia, Mexico, Colombia, India, Singapore and Malaysia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries. Regulation of Internet Transactions . Many jurisdictions in which our clients and we operate are considering, or are expected to consider, legislation with regard to Internet transactions, and in particular with regard to choice of law, the legality of certain eCommerce transactions, the collection of applicable taxes and copyright and trademark infringement. In October 2006, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions. The legislation applies to payment system participants, including Visa and our U.S. clients, and compliance was required by June 1, 2010. These federal rules require us and our clients to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs, decrease our transaction volumes or both. In addition, the U.S. Congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our clients. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes.  Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would affect our clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our clients ability to extend credit by using payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We own a number of valuable trademarks and designs, which are essential to our business, including Visa, Interlink, PLUS, Visa Electron, the Winged V design, the Dove design and the Bands DesignBlue, White  Gold. We also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands, products, programs and services. Through agreements with our clients, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment, including paper-based forms (principally cash and checks), card-based payments (including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid, private-label and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards) and other electronic payments (including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automatic clearing house, or ACH, payments and electronic data interchange). Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants. The leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club. Other general-purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. In certain countries, our competitors have leading positions, such as China UnionPay in China, which is the sole domestic inter-bank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in China due to local regulation. We also compete against private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other merchant. In the debit card market segment, Visa and MasterCard are the primary global brands. In addition, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the online debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands are the primary brands, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume. We increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional bank-centric business model. The emergence of these competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies.  Based on payments volume, total volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general-purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2009: ##TABLE_START Company  Payments Volume   Total Volume   Total Transactions   Cards    (billions)   (billions)   (billions)   (millions)  Visa Inc.

For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Note 15Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Working Capital Requirements Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients generally represents our most consistent and substantial liquidity requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution clients with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement. During fiscal 2010, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $129 million, with the highest daily balance being $386 million. Seasonality We do not expect to experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 accounted for more than 30% of our fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 operating revenues.  Employees At September 30, 2010, we employed approximately 6,800 persons worldwide, including CyberSource. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Regulatory Risks Regulations that prohibit us from requiring our customers to use only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. We have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some debit products choose to include only the Visa network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. Increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States has already resulted in laws that will limit our and issuers ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business . These restrictions and future regulations like them in the United States and elsewhere have the potential to cause a material decrease in the number of transactions we process. In order to retain that transaction volume, we might have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers, or we might have to increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants. Any of these eventualities could have a material, adverse affect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Interchange reimbursement fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide, and the resulting regulations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours. In connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system, interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers, the financial institutions that issue Visa cards to cardholders. They are typically paid by acquirers, the financial institutions that offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants. We refer to a system like ours, in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer, as an open-loop system.  We generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process over our network. Consequently, changes to these fees can have a substantial impact on our revenues. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the United States and other countries. However, in certain jurisdictions, interchange rates and related practices are subject to increased government regulation. Increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area. See The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business. In addition, interchange rates have become subject to increased scrutiny elsewhere, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing them. These include Australia, Canada, Brazil and South Africa. If we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system unattractive. This could materially lower overall transaction volumes. It could also materially increase the attraction of closed-loop payments systemsthose with direct connections to both merchants and consumersand other forms of payment. In addition, issuers could begin to charge higher fees to consumers. This would make our card programs less desirable and reduce our transaction volumes and profitability. Acquirers could elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the level of Visa interchange, leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer Visa cardholders to alternate payment systems. In addition, issuers and acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge. Any of the foregoing could have a substantial, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act recently enacted in the United States includes provisions that will regulate the selection of payment networks by issuers and the routing of debit transactions by retailers. This may result in the routing of debit transactions onto competing networks, potentially reducing the processing fees we earn on debit transactions. The legislation also establishes regulation and oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices. In addition, the Federal Reserve now has the power to regulate network fees to the extent necessary to prevent evasion of the new rules on interchange rates. The act also created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Federal Reserve System. The bureau will assume responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and will have new authorities with respect to consumer issues. The bureaus actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers. This could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues. The new legislation may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Failure by our clients or by us successfully to adjust our strategies to compete in the new environment would increase this impact.  New regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products. Regulators around the world increasingly look at each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries, states or regions. This includes the recent U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product. For example, regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit. As a result, the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment. These include matters like interchange rates, network exclusivity and preferred routing agreements. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our products, services, fees and other important aspects of our business, with the same effect. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues. Governments in certain countries provide resources or protection to selected national payment card and processing providers. These governments may take this action in order to support these providers. They may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries, to force us to leave, or to restrict substantially our activities there. For example, China, a significant emerging market, has increasingly tightened its rules requiring use of its payment system for domestic transactions. Additionally, governments in certain countries are considering, or may consider, regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country. This would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients. Our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands. Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued, our payments volume and our revenues. Recently, privacy, data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States (at the federal and state level) and in other countries. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach. These measures may materially increase our costs and our clients costs. They may also decrease the number of our cards our clients issue. This would materially and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, our failure, or the failure of our clients, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. If government regulators determine that we are a systemically important payments system, we may have to change our settlement procedures or other operations, making it costlier to operate our business and reducing our operational flexibility. A number of international initiatives are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries has developed a set of core principles for systemically important payment systems. Government regulators in the United States or elsewhere may determine that we are a  systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk-management requirements on us. These could include new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system. Any of these developments could increase the cost of operating our business. Recent increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues. Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. Examples include: ##TABLE_START    Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation . The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions require us to maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering program; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation . Regulations imposed by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, restrict us from dealing with certain countries and parties considered to be connected with money laundering, terrorism or narcotics. Non-U.S. Visa International members may not be similarly restricted, so our payments system may be used for transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions, potentially subjecting us to penalties, reputational damage or loss of business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of the Price of Credit . Many jurisdictions in which our cards are used have new or proposed regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuers to charge interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act and proposed regulations under it. They also include proposed changes to the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which, if implemented along with regulations required to be promulgated under the Credit CARD Act, could result in a decrease in our payments volume and revenues; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of Internet Transactions . Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using our cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the law that governs them, their taxation and the allocation of intellectual property rights; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Safety and Soundness Regulation . Recent federal banking regulations may make some financial institutions less attracted to becoming an issuer of our cards, because they may be subject to more conservative accounting procedures, increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END Complying with these and other regulations may increase our costs. Similarly, the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations could limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation Risks A finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damages. Since 2005, approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain financial institutions that issue Visa-branded payment cards and acquire Visa-branded payment transactions in the U.S. We refer to this as the interchange litigation. Among other antitrust allegations, the plaintiffs allege that  Visas setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages will be trebled, and we may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established. This could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment. The interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation that our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address. The retrospective responsibility plan may not, however, adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements of, or judgments in, the interchange litigation. Failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or, in certain circumstances, even cause us to become insolvent. In addition, even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our direct financial exposure, settlements or judgments involving the multidistrict litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. See Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation, and See Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments. Our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation, which is described in Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offerings), a loss-sharing agreement and a judgment-sharing agreement. In addition, our U.S. members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique and complicated, and if we cannot use one or more of them, we could have difficulty funding the payment of a settlement or final judgment against us in a covered litigation. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or, in certain circumstances, even cause us to become insolvent. The retrospective responsibility plan only addresses the covered litigation. The plan does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre-trial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation. In addition, our retrospective responsibility plan covers only the potential monetary liability from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation. Non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future. This could adversely affect our revenues, increase our expenses and/or limit our prospects for growth. Therefore, even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguards us from the monetary impact of settlements of, and judgments in, the covered litigation, it may not insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of them.  If the settlements of our currency conversion cases do not become final and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuits relating to Visa U.S.A.s and Visa Internationals currency conversion practices, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that their currency conversion practices are or were deceptive, anti-competitive or otherwise unlawful. On July 20, 2006, and September 14, 2006, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into agreements to settle or otherwise dispose of these matters. Under the settlement agreements, Visa U.S.A. paid approximately $100 million as part of the defendants settlement fund for the federal actions and approximately $19 million to fund settlement of the state cases. Although the federal court has granted final approval of the settlement agreements, the settlements are subject to resolution of any appeals. If we are unsuccessful in any appellate proceeding, all of the agreements resolving the federal and state actions will terminate. If that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuits on the merits, we may have to pay restitution, damages or both, and we may be required to modify our currency conversion practices. The potential amount of damages, restitution or both could be substantial. In addition, although we have substantially changed the practices at issue in these litigations, court-ordered changes to our currency conversion and cross-border transaction practices could materially and adversely affect our business. See Note 22  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. If we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, which may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Like many large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition/antitrust law, securities law, consumer protection law, or intellectual property law, among others. These lawsuits and investigations have been initiated by a wide variety of parties, including the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, U.S. state attorneys general, merchants, and consumers. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 22  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. In the United States, private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us. This is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers, due to the size and scope of our business. If we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit, monetary damages could be significant. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages, limit the fees we charge or change other business practices. This could limit our payments volume and result in a material and adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, cash flow, financial conditions, prospects for future growth and overall business and could even cause us to become insolvent. Limitations on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. For example, in October 2010, we reached a settlement, subject to court approval, with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and a number of state attorneys general relating to their investigation of certain Visa merchant acceptance practices. Under the agreement, Visa will allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer cardholders to a particular form of payment including to a specific  network brand or to any card product, such as a non-reward Visa credit card. See Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The agreement does not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange, and does not preclude the DOJ from pursuing a future investigation of these or other topics. Similarly, as a result of the June 2003 settlement of a U.S. merchant lawsuit against Visa U.S.A., merchants are able to reject our consumer debit cards in the United States while still accepting other Visa-branded cards, and vice versa. These and other limitations on our business that were the result of settlements of, or judgments in, litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Tax audits or disputes, or changes in the tax laws applicable to us, could materially increase our tax payments. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional audits in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 21  Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. Our agreement with Visa Europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities. Under our framework agreement with Visa Europe, we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we, nor any of our related parties or agents, participated in the actions giving rise to such claims. Such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. Business Risks The intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. We offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand our card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing support payments and other support. Over the past several years, we have increased the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the United States. In order to stay competitive, we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives. This pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability. Pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks, presenting the potential for the same adverse effects. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our  revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. Finally, increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, and we may not succeed in these efforts. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of intense competition in our industry. The global payments industry is intensely competitive. Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks and electronic transactions, such as wire transfers and automatic clearinghouse payments. In addition, our payment programs compete against the card-based payments systems of our competitors, such as MasterCard, American Express, Discover and private-label cards issued by merchants. Some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. They may offer a wider range of programs and services than we do. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do. They may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have. They may also introduce more innovative programs and services than we provide. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. These include domestic networks in the United States, China, Canada, Australia and other countries and regions. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. This is especially so given the recent U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which restricts our ability to require network exclusivity in the debit sector. Most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive. These include those with our largest clients, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships, sometimes on relatively short notice, and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15Enterprise-wide Disclosure and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START    Competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Competition may increase from alternative types of payment services, such as mobile payments services, online payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments. ##TABLE_END  Our failure to compete effectively against any of these threats could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business. Our position in the payments value chain underpins our business. Certain of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternative payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. In addition, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients, materially and adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. The banking industry has recently undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation, which could continue. Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors. This could result in the acquired banks Visa business shifting to that competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. In addition, one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors, shifting its payments volume to that competitor. Any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients. This consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us. In addition, consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. In addition, the current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. Merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation, regulation, regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements. We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants are seeking to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation. If they continue, these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business.  We, along with our clients, negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, our clients and we may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants. This could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives. Certain financial institutions have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues. Certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues. In addition, these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Failure to maintain relationships with our clients and others and failure of clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business. We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates, if any, or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features. In addition, we do not generally solicit merchants to accept our cards, and we do not establish the discount rates charged to merchants for card acceptance, which rates are the responsibility of acquirers. As a result, the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them. In many countries outside the United States, our clients or other processors authorize, clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems. In addition, we do not generally have direct relationships with merchants and do not have direct relationships with cardholders. Consequently, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards, Our inability to control the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf, and to the extent that third-party vendors fail to deliver services, our business and reputation could be impaired. Our perception in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation, which are key assets of our business. Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry. Our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands. From time to time, our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge, which may materially and adversely affect our business. Further, Visa Europe has very broad latitude to operate the Visa business in and use our brands and technology within Visa Europes region, in which we have only limited control over the operation of the Visa business. Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the Visa brands  in its region, and the strength of the Visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of Visa Europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in Europe. Finally, adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny. Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Unprecedented events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world. This includes decreased consumer spending, increased unemployment, deflation, increased savings, decreased debt, excess housing inventory, lowered government spending, less export activity, continued challenges in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility, additional government intervention and the uncertainty arising from new government policies. This economic turmoil has affected the economies of the United States and other mature economies in particular. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise. These could include, among other things, policy missteps, exhaustion of U.S. and other national economic stimulus packages, dramatic increases in oil prices, tax increases, economic turmoil in China, the Euro zone or Japan or a significant decline in the commercial real estate market. Some existing clients have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential changes in laws and regulations. Many of our clients, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected. Our financial results may be negatively affected by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis. The severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present. As a result, our revenue growth has been and may be negatively affected, or we may be affected, in several ways, including but not limited to the following: ##TABLE_START    Constriction of consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease cardholder spending. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or additional expense reductions, which may reduce our revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, affect our revenue and reduce cardholders desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business with those institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Our clients may default on their settlement obligations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our business and prospects, as well as our revenue and profitability, could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our clients. ##TABLE_END In addition, regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, growth, revenue, profitability and overall business. A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions. We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions. Our clients pay us fees in connection with cross-border transactions. Some of those fees may differ if conversion from the merchants currency to the cardholders billing currency is required. Thus, revenue from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuates with cross-border travel and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency. Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, natural disasters, the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases. A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. A decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients settlement in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Transactions outside the United States represent an increasingly important part of our strategy. In order to continue to grow in those areas, we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the types of products we provide, the quality of our service and the viability of our brand. If we cannot employ our organizational resources effectively, we will be unable to do so. Finally, because we are domiciled in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations we have guaranteed. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources, as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a  settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We estimate settlement at risk (or exposure) based on the sum of three inputs. The first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin. The second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume. The third is the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. Additionally, from time to time, we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary. See Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions. Some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow. If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently, the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism, climate change or accident. Our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computer-based attacks, leading to an interruption in service, increased costs or the compromise of data security. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services, adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services, the use of our cards could decline, reducing our revenues and net income. Rapid, significant technological changes are confronting the payments industry. These include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our card products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties intellectual property rights. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. Account data breaches involving card data stored by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues. Our clients, merchants, others and we store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions  generated by cards carrying our brands. Breach of the systems storing sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, to reputational damage and to claims against us. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards, which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, any data security breach could result in additional regulation, which could materially increase our costs. An increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information. They use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards. A rise in fraud levels involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs. Failure to maintain interoperability between Visa Inc.s and Visa Europes authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands. Before our reorganization in October 2007, Visa Europe and we shared authorization, clearing, and settlement systems. Visa Europe completed and substantially deployed its own systems in the 2010 fiscal year. As a result, Visa Europe and we will have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europes newly independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems as they diverge over time. Failure to authorize or clear and settle transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the Visa brands. Risks Related to our Structure and Organization We have little ability to control Visa Europes operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us. Visa Europe has very broad rights to operate the Visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship. If we want to change a global rule or require Visa Europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for Visa Europe and its members, then Visa Europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that Visa Europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation. If Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations, our remedies under this agreement are limited. We cannot terminate the agreement even upon Visa Europes material, uncured breach. Although we have a call right to acquire Visa Europe, we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances. These and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder.  In some instances, as in the case of CyberSource, Visa Europe may have the right to control the activities of newly acquired entities within Visa Europes territory. In any event, Visa Europes exclusive license rights in Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from Visa Europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in Visa Europes region. If Visa Europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock, we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income. We have granted Visa Europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised. We will incur a substantial financial obligation if Visa Europe exercises this option. Visa Europe may do so at any time. We may need to obtain third-party financing in order to meet our obligation, by either borrowing funds or selling stock. An equity offering, or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock, would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price. Sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms. See Note 3Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. If Visa Europe exercises the put option, we may encounter difficulties in integrating Visa Europes business and systems into our existing operations. If we cannot do so quickly and cost-effectively, the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management, disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we would become subject to the many regulations of the European Union that govern the operations of Visa Europe, including any regulatory disputes. We are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option. We record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations. Consequently, the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share. These quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant. The existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it. If we cannot remain organizationally effective, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive, economic and regulatory environment. Since our reorganization in October 2007, we have increasingly centralized our management and operations. For us to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization, and avoid U.S.-centric thinking. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, the current competitive, economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges. We will be unable to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough, define our appetite for risk specifically enough, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough. We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees. Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business.  Acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. The integration of the recently acquired CyberSource Corporation will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions. We will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the Visa Europe territory. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues. Moreover, our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the expiration or waiver of transfer restrictions on our class B and C common stock, could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class A common stock, adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class A common stock. The market price and voting power of our class A common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding. The market price of our class A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur, such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class A common stock. Specifically, on March 25, 2011, all of our restricted shares of class C common stock will become transferable at once. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted. Under our retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class B common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class A common stock, benefitting the holders of class B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest in Visa Inc. held by the holders of class A common stock. The amount of this dilution will depend on the amount, if any, of the funds released from the escrow account and the market price of our class A common stock near the time the funds are released. Shares of Class A common stock acquired by Visa members and certain affiliates and competitors convert automatically into shares of class C common stock, which have limited voting rights and may be subject to restrictions on transfer. Shares of class A common stock acquired by a Visa member, an affiliate of a Visa member or any person that is a competitor or its affiliate, in each case to the extent acting as a principal investor, convert automatically into shares of class C common stock. Some shares of class C common stock cannot be transferred until March 25, 2011. In addition, holders of shares of our class C common stock do not have the right to vote on certain matters, including the election of directors.  Holders of our shares of our class B and C common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions, and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class A common stock. Although their voting rights are limited, holders of shares of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control. Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock, shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5% of our total outstanding shares on an as-converted basis. Our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows. Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. Any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. However, sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends. Payment of future dividends, if any, would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If, because of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock. Furthermore, no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class of common stock. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Dividend Declaration and Policy During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, we paid the following quarterly cash dividends per share of our class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock, on an as-converted basis) to all holders of record of our class A, B and C common stock. ##TABLE_START 2010  Dividend Per Share  First Quarter  $ 0.125  Second Quarter   0.125  Third Quarter   0.125  Fourth Quarter   0.125  2009  Dividend Per Share  First Quarter  $ 0.105  Second Quarter   0.105  Third Quarter   0.105  Fourth Quarter   0.105  ##TABLE_END In addition, on October 20, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock, on an as-converted basis) payable on December 7, 2010 to holders of record as of November 19, 2010 of our class A, B and C common stock.  Subject to legally available funds, we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding class A, B and C common stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery, which has shown signs of slow but gradual improvement. We expect consumer and commercial spending, and our payments volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the U.S. in July 2010 includes provisions that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in the U.S. While the legislation does not directly regulate the network fees we charge, except to ensure that fees are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rates, it may give retailers greater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks, which can reduce the processing fees we currently earn on debit transactions. Because the implementation details for this new legislation will be determined over the next year, the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements is unknown at this time. However, we expect to see the impacts of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Other regulatory measures previously enacted in the U.S. became effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These regulatory measures primarily impacted our clients, but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payments volumes. We continue to believe that our broad platform of payment products provides substantial value to both retailers and consumers, and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency, will buffer the impacts of our current regulatory environment, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, and in particular payments volume growth outside the U.S. Funding of the litigation escrow account. During May 2010 and subsequently in October 2010, after our fiscal year end, we deposited $500 million and $800 million, respectively, into the escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan. Under the terms of the plan, when Visa funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our  U.S. clients and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On an as-converted basis, funding of the escrow account had the effect of our repurchasing approximately 7 million shares and 11 million shares of class A common stock, respectively. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Share repurchase plan. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2010, we have drawn on the entire $1.0 billion authorized amount by repurchasing a total of 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock at an average price of $77.48 per share. In October 2010, subsequent to our fiscal year end, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan, which will be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Expansion of our eCommerce capabilities. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants, at a price of $26.00 per share. The total purchase consideration was approximately $2.0 billion, paid with cash on hand. The acquisition of CyberSource will expand our online payment, fraud and security management capabilities and is expected to accelerate our growth in the eCommerce category. The results of CyberSource are included in our results from the acquisition date. See Note 6CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. The growth in nominal payments volume in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, in particular credit and debit, was primarily driven by growth outside the U.S. Comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year-over-year nominal payments volume impact. The number of processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally. The payments volume and processed transactions tables presented below do not include CyberSource volumes and transactions. CyberSource activities primarily contribute to our data processing revenues, which is discussed below in Results of Operations .  This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars (1) : ##TABLE_START   U.S.A.

Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. ##TABLE_END  This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009 % Change   2009 vs. 2008 % Change    (in millions)        Total processed transactions   45,411    39,885    36,956    14 %   8 % ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSources online payment gateway. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock-based compensation, incentives, fringe benefits and contractor expense.  Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional and consulting fees consists of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, and the incremental basis in technology and other assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource. The incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization was fully depreciated and amortized at September 30, 2010. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost method investments. Other non-operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Also included in this amount is the change in the fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008    (in millions, except percentages)  U.S. operating revenues  $ 4,718   $ 4,023   $ 3,664   $ 695   $ 359    17 %   10 % Rest of world operating revenues   3,137    2,669    2,378    468    291    18 %   12 % Visa Europe operating revenues   210    219    221    (9 )   (2 )   (4 )%   (1 )%                       Total Operating Revenues  $ 8,065   $ 6,911   $ 6,263   $ 1,154   $ 648    17 %   10 %                       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END  Growth in operating revenues primarily reflects an increase in nominal payments volume, continued growth of processed transactions and the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery, and evaluate the potential impacts to operating revenues under our current regulatory environment. We may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Revenues from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuate with cross-border travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Cross-border transactions have shown signs of improvement in all geographies during fiscal 2010. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 1% increase in total operating revenues. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. As we are substantially hedged through fiscal 2011, we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuations next year. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008    (in millions, except percentages)  Service revenues  $ 3,497   $ 3,174   $ 3,061   $ 323   $ 113    10 %   4 % Data processing revenues   3,125    2,430    2,073    695    357    29 %   17 % International transaction revenues   2,290    1,916    1,721    374    195    20 %   11 % Other revenues   713    625    569    88    56    14 %   10 % Volume and support incentives   (1,560 )   (1,234 )   (1,161 )   (326 )   (73 )   26 %   6 %                       Total Operating Revenues  $ 8,065   $ 6,911   $ 6,263   $ 1,154   $ 648    17 %   10 %                       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. We expect service revenues to increase in fiscal 2011 as we continue to align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. ##TABLE_END Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. ##TABLE_START    Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Data processing ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  revenues also benefitted slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. We do not believe that the current rate of growth in data processing revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth due to the inclusion of these pricing actions, which have largely anniversaried in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. However, we will benefit from the inclusion of a full year CyberSource activity in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_END Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to 8% growth in the number of transactions processed during the year, combined with other strategic pricing modifications. ##TABLE_START    International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross-border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross-border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions could hinder this growth. ##TABLE_END International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross-border nominal payments volume, primarily due to strategic pricing modifications made after fiscal 2008. ##TABLE_START    Other revenues increased during fiscal 2010, primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We entered into this licensing arrangement with VisaNet do Brasil following its initial public offering and the sale of our equity interest in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase also reflects growth in other new license and royalty fees. ##TABLE_END Other revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to growth in the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. ##TABLE_START    Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one-time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. As anticipated, volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 16% in fiscal 2010. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.0% to 16.5% for the full 2011 fiscal year. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. ##TABLE_END Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long-term customer contracts. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non-recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008.  Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008    (in millions, except percentages)  Personnel  $ 1,222   $ 1,228   $ 1,314   $ (6 )  $ (86 )   (1 )%   (7 )% Network, EDP and communications   425    393    339    32    54    8 %   16 % Advertising, marketing and promotion   964    918    1,016    46    (98 )   5 %   (10 )% Professional and consulting fees   286    268    323    18    (55 )   7 %   (17 )% Depreciation and amortization   265    226    237    39    (11 )   17 %   (5 )% Administrative and other   359    338    332    21    6    7 %   2 % Litigation provision   (45 )   2    1,470    (47 )   (1,468 )   NM    NM                        Total Operating Expenses  $ 3,476   $ 3,373   $ 5,031   $ 103   $ (1,658 )   3 %   (33 )%                       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Personnel decreased in fiscal 2010, reflecting lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 12  Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements . The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced contractor fees and employee incentive-related costs in fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_START    Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2010 and 2009, reflecting higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Advertising, marketing and promotion increased in fiscal 2010, due to higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which will not recur in fiscal 2011. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. We continue to review and refine our marketing and advertising spending globally to ensure it is consistent with our growth initiatives. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2009, expenses decreased, despite the launch of our global More people go with Visa campaign, reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. ##TABLE_START    Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in fiscal 2008 in connection with our global reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services.  ##TABLE_START    Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition. The increase also reflects charges related to the new east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. We expect associated depreciation and amortization related to CyberSource assets to increase in fiscal 2011, reflecting a full year of charges, or $76 million. This increase will be offset by the absence of $68 million in annual depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis of assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, as those assets became fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of depreciation and amortization for assets in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. ##TABLE_START    Administrative and other increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. ##TABLE_END Administrative and other expenses remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. ##TABLE_START    Litigation provision in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the $41 million pre-tax gain recorded as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals during fiscal 2010 for certain legal matters. There was no other significant provision activity to offset the credit balance during fiscal 2010. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of litigation provision recorded in connection with the Discover settlement in fiscal 2008. See Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2010   2009   2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008   2010 vs. 2009   2009 vs. 2008    (in millions, except percentages)  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  $ (7 )  $    $ 1   $ (7 )  $ (1 )   NM    NM  Interest expense   (72 )   (115 )   (143 )   43    28    (37 )%   (20 )% Investment income, net   49    575    211    (526 )   364    (92 )%   NM  Other   79    2    35    77    (33 )   NM    (95 )%                       Total Other Income (Expense)  $ 49   $ 462   $ 104   $ (413 )  $ 358    (90 )%   NM                        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2010 and 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre-tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances, reflecting the use of $1.0 billion to repurchase class A common stock under the share repurchase plan, $682 million to prepay the Retailers litigation and $500 million to fund the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the pre-tax gain of $473 million discussed above, partially offset by lower interest income earned from lower investment balances after funding our October 2008 stock redemptions. ##TABLE_START    Other non-operating income in fiscal 2010 reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. The change in value does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 3  Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Other non-operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased to 36% in fiscal 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009 and 40% in fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2010, and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.  Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009   2008    (in millions)  Total cash provided by (used in):    Operating activities  $ 2,691   $ 558   $ 531  Investing activities   (1,904 )   1,830    554  Financing activities   (1,542 )   (2,751 )   3,624  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   5    1    (5 )             (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents  $ (750 )  $ (362 )  $ 4,704              ##TABLE_END Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including non-controlling interest of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for volume and support incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation, as further discussed below. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year-to-date net income and lower litigation settlement payments. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including non-controlling interest of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non-cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income including non-controlling interest of $804 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of cash to satisfy litigation settlement payments and volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities compared to $290 million in the prior year, both of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, in the current year compared to $884 million of distributions in the prior year as the Fund liquidated. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects $1.0 billion of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re-invested in shorter-term cash equivalents and $415 million of property,  equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, funding of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and $368 million of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually-required redemption of certain of our series class C common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributable to IPO-related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based  on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010. U.S. commercial paper programs . We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2010 was $1.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, we deposited an additional $800 million into the escrow account. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2010, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our unsecured debt as follows: ##TABLE_START   Standard and Poors   Moodys  Debt type  Rating   Outlook   Rating   Outlook  Long-term unsecured debt     Local   A+    Stable    A1    Stable  Foreign   A+    Stable    A1    Stable  Short-term unsecured debt   A-1    Stable    P-1    Stable  ##TABLE_END Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.  Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements , as well as Sources of Liquidity . In fiscal 2010, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our Retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement to prepay our remaining payment obligations under the original Retailers litigation settlement agreement. We made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation in October 2009. Share repurchase plan. During fiscal 2010, we used $1.0 billion to repurchase approximately 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Dividends . During fiscal 2010, we paid $368 million in dividends. On October 20, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $107 million in connection with this dividend in December 2010. See Note 16Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price.  At September 30, 2010, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $267 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below, for illustrative purposes only, is based on Visa Europes forecasted financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2010 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2010, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 18.8 and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 3.5. At September 30, 2010, the spot P/E ratio was 15.7 and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.6. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. ##TABLE_START Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $75 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $75 million   (in millions)  (in millions) 25  $1,875  $625 20  $1,500  $500 15  $1,125  $375 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. ##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are  funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $66 million, $170 million and $190 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $60 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2010 reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal 2009. The new data center supports our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million to $275 million in fiscal 2011, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. Acquisition of CyberSource. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation for approximately $2.0 billion in cash, or $1.8 billion net of cash received. The combination is expected to accelerate the growth of our eCommerce category and enhance the value of our network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. See Note 6CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Other uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2010, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $44 million. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2010, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $5.7 billion of assets, of which $13 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. At September, 30, 2010, debt instruments in this category included auction rate securities. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements primarily comprise guarantees. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe and what is now the headquarters for our Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2010.  We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. See Note 19Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2010. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 3Visa Europe, Note 11Debt, Note 12Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 19Commitments and Contingencies , and Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements . ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period    Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years   Total    (in millions)  Purchase orders (1)  $ 725   $ 102   $ 60   $    $ 887  Leases (2)   70    90    24    12    196  Volume and support incentives (3)   1,788    2,666    1,450    519    6,423  Marketing and sponsorships (4)   110    202    168    105    585  Litigation settlement payments   352    70            422  Debt   15    24    12        51  Other (5)   107                107                      Total (6, 7, 8)  $ 3,167   $ 3,154   $ 1,714   $ 636   $ 8,671                      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Represents future cash payments for volume and support incentive agreements with financial institutions and merchants under various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 19Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three years to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Includes dividend amount of $107 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2010 and will be paid on December 7, 2010 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 19, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $443 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the corresponding effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2010, we also accrued $58 million of interest and $10 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $267 million at September 30, 2010 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 12Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements . ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue RecognitionVolume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with clients, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based  on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria include the existence of future benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2010, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair ValueVisa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which, if exercised, we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price-to-earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 3Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $267 million at September 30, 2010. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long-term value of the Company or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled  scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair ValueGoodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring CyberSource in July 2010, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. See Note 6CyberSource Acquisition and Note 9  Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets . Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of July 1, 2010, we evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is  measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2010. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two-step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on July 1, 2010, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we completed the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010, which resulted in an additional $1.2 billion in goodwill and established a second reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $0.8 billion was allocated to the second reporting unit. The remainder was allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exist as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.4 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $595 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2010. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.  Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 22Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $627 million and $742 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $627 million outstanding at September 30, 2010 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $55 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2010. See Note 14  Derivatives Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.  We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $135 million and $176 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2010. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $13 million and $34 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately $1 million at September 30, 2010. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2010. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risks Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $766 million and $703 million and projected benefit obligations were $743 million and $739 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2011, which we expect to make in September 2011. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP San Francisco, California November 19, 2010  VISA INC.

VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada), Inovant LLC (Inovant) and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate the worlds largest retail electronic payments network. The Company provides financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, and facilitates global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. The Company does not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on Visa-branded cards, which are the independent responsibility of the Companys issuing clients. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, Visa undertook a reorganization in October 2007, and in March 2008 the Company completed its initial public offering, or the IPO. See Note 2The Reorganization. In July 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of CyberSource in order to expand the Companys online payment, fraud, and security management capabilities and to accelerate its growth in eCommerce. The results of CyberSource are included in the Companys results from the acquisition date. See Note 6  CyberSource Acquisition . Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa Inc. and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company consolidates all entities that are controlled by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Non-controlling interests are reported as a component of equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications, not affecting net income, have been made to prior period information to conform to the current period presentation format, including reclassification of $85 million and $115 million of contractor expense, which was previously reported in professional and consulting fees, to personnel for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. The Companys activities are interrelated and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa Inc. as a single global business. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could materially differ from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company deposited funds from the IPO and its own funds into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan for discussion of covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments together with the income earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. The amount of the escrow account, equivalent to the actual undiscounted amount of payments expected to be made beyond one year from the balance sheet date for settled claims, is classified as a non-current asset. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in investment income, net, on the consolidated statement of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain required assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of the Companys cash equivalents (money market funds), mutual fund equity securities and exchange-traded equity securities are based on quoted prices and are therefore classified as Level 1. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 assets include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, and other observable inputs. Foreign exchange derivative instruments in an asset or liability position are also classified in Level 2 and are valued using inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Inputs reflect the use of significant management judgment via the use of pricing models for which the assumptions include estimates of market participant assumptions. Level 3 assets include the Companys auction rate securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities. Level 3 liabilities include the Visa Europe put option. See Note 3Visa Europe. Effective fiscal 2010, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that allows companies to use net asset value per share as a fair value measurement without further adjustment as a practical expedient. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Additional disclosures required are not presented because the related investments are not material to the overall consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company adopted FASB guidance to disclose significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The guidance also clarified existing disclosure requirements for the disaggregation of assets and liabilities presented and discussion of inputs and valuation techniques. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements .  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Available-for-sale securities include investments in debt and marketable equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company classifies its debt and marketable equity securities as available-for-sale to meet its operational needs. Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and stated maturities less than one year from the balance sheet date are current assets, while those with stated maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gain or loss. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in investment income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. OTTI is assessed when fair value is below amortized cost. OTTI can be triggered when a company has the intent to sell a security, is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, or does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt securities for the periods presented are not material. In addition, the credit and non-credit loss components of debt securities on the balance sheet for which OTTI was previously recognized were not material. The Company had no OTTI for available-for-sale debt securities during fiscal 2010. The Company recognized OTTI of $9 million during fiscal 2009 primarily related to corporate debt, mortgage backed and asset backed securities, and $9 million during fiscal 2008 primarily related to auction rate securities. Trading assets include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. The trading activity of these investments is dependent upon the actions of the Companys employees. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in investment income, net, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company accounts for investments in other entities under the historical cost method of accounting when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5%, and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for sale investments, the Reserve Primary Fund (see Note 7Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets ), accounts receivable, non-marketable equity investments, customer collateral, accounts payable, debt, settlement guarantees, derivative instruments, the Visa Europe put option, and settlement receivable and payable. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2010 approximates their carrying value as reported on the consolidated balance sheets except as otherwise disclosed, or as deemed impracticable to estimate the fair value, such as for non-marketable equity investments. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements. Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for clearing and settling customer payment transactions. Net settlements are generally cleared within one to two business days, resulting in amounts due to and from clients. These settlement receivables and payables are stated at cost and are presented gross on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from credit, debit and travelers cheque product clearings. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology, net are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets acquired in the July 2010 CyberSource acquisition. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payment network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technologys estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to lease agreements which contain lease incentives is recorded on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradename, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. The Company tests each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. The Company evaluated its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of July 1, 2010 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Finite-lived intangible assets include those acquired in the July 2010 CyberSource acquisition, and consist of customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 5 years to 15 years. Since the acquisition of CyberSource, no events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists. See Note 6CyberSource Acquisition and Note 9Intangible Assets, Net . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of July 1 st , or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment is reviewed using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on July 1, 2010 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, the Company completed the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010, which resulted in additional goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the Companys overall business performance and market capitalization. Volume and support incentives. The Company enters into incentive agreements with clients, merchants, and other business partners designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenues, or  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  expenses where an identifiable benefit can be established. The Company generally capitalizes certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of the clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Companys defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from the Companys estimates. Litigation accruals associated with settled obligations to be paid over periods longer than one year are initially recorded using the present value of future payment obligations. The obligation is accreted to its full payment value with the corresponding accretion charge included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional and consulting fees. See also Note 22  Legal Matters. Revenue recognition . The Companys operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under volume and support incentives. The Company recognizes revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues predominantly represent payments by clients with respect to their card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand and are based principally upon spending on Visa-branded cards for goods and services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives. These revenues are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues represent revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Companys clients globally and Visa Europe. These revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSources online payment gateway. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on cardholder transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. Revenues from these cross-border transactions are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Other revenues primarily include revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement ( see Note 3Visa Europe) , and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Advertising, marketing and promotion. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Companys income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes to be paid for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and allowable tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. Foreign taxes paid are generally deducted to reduce federal income taxes payable. Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on matching the duration of a pool of high quality corporate bonds to the expected benefit payment stream, and is used to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, approximately 8 years for United States plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. The  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Company immediately recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. The Company began including annual disclosures about the fair value of its pension plan assets in fiscal 2010, as required. See Note 12  Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Companys functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in administrative and other in the consolidated statements of operations. The functional currency for Visa Canada is the Canadian dollar. Translation from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted operating revenues and expenses. Derivatives are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to administrative and other for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the contracts at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income. See Note 14Derivative Financial Instruments. Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation for guarantees and indemnifications at inception if the fair value is estimable, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies issuing and acquiring clients from settlement losses suffered by the failure of any other customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with Visas operating regulations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company also indemnifies Visa Europe for any claims brought against Visa Europe arising out of the provision of services by Visa Inc.s customer financial institutions, as described in Note 3Visa Europe.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market condition based awards is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on managements best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 18Share-based Compensation. Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 17Earnings Per Share. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company included unvested instruments granted in share-based payment transactions that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in the calculation of earnings per share as a separate class of security. This change did not result in any impact to fiscal 2009 and 2008 full year diluted class A net income per share. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-10, Consolidation, which changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The Company will adopt ASC 810-10 effective October 1, 2010. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. The Company will adopt ASU 2009-13 effective October 1, 2010. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, which requires additional information in the roll-forward of Level 3 assets and liabilities, including the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. This ASU impacts disclosures only. The Company will adopt this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements . Note 2The Reorganization In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. and the retrospective responsibility plan was established. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The Company reflected the reorganization as a single transaction occurring on October 1, or the reorganization date, using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 3Visa Europe .  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  The Company issued different classes and series of common stock in the reorganization reflecting the different rights and obligations of the Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe. Total shares authorized and issued in the reorganization totaled approximately 775 million shares of class B and class C common stock. A significant portion of the common stock issued to Visa Europe was redeemed in October 2008. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity . Note 3Visa Europe Under the terms of the reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa Inc. common stock as described in Note 2The Reorganization, a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. Visa Europe Put Option Agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa Inc. to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the put option. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2010, the Company revalued the put option, reducing its estimated fair value to approximately $267 million and recorded corresponding non-cash, other non-operating income of $79 million. This reduction in value was primarily the result of declines in the Companys P/E ratio during the second half of fiscal 2010 and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europes option, which under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Companys estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction at the measurement date. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  The estimated fair value of the put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements. The valuation of the put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa Inc. and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. In determining the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 3.5x. In determining the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 5.3x. The decrease in the P/E differential reflects the overall decrease in Visa Inc.s P/E during the second half of fiscal 2010. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. Visa Call Option Agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa Inc. a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option, in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATMs in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these triggers occurring to be remote. The Framework Agreement. The relationship between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed upon circumstances. The quarterly base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and is approximately $143 million per year, except for fiscal 2008 during which the fee was $41 million due to an agreed upon formula. A liability of $132 million representing the estimated obligation to provide the licenses during fiscal 2008 at below fair value was included in the total purchase consideration in the reorganization, and fully settled upon redemption of Visa Europes class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares in October 2008. Beginning November 9, 2010, the quarterly base fee is adjusted annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the quarterly base fee below $143 million per year. The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the quarterly base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed upon global rules governing the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks and interoperability of Visa Inc.s systems with the systems of Visa Europe. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. The Company will indemnify Visa Europe for claims arising from activities in the field of financial payment and processing services brought outside Visa Europes region and Visa Europe will indemnify Visa Inc. for any likewise claims brought within Visa Europes region. The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be nominal at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Visa Inc. also provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europes region and the rest of the world. During fiscal 2010, Visa Europe substantially deployed its own regional clearing and settlement system and Visa Inc. ceased the provision of clearing and settlement system services for transactions occurring within Visa Europes region. The parties are expected to continue to share foreign exchange revenues related to currency conversion for transactions involving European cardholders, as well as other cross-border transactions that take place in Visa Europes region, until mid fiscal 2011. The parties also use each others value-added processing products and other services. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation. These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of an escrow agreement, a loss sharing agreement, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, the conversion feature of the Companys shares of class B common stock and the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  members pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. In accordance with the escrow agreement, following the Companys IPO in fiscal 2008, the Company deposited $3.0 billion of the proceeds of the offering in an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are being paid. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The initial deposit reduced this conversion rate to 0.7143. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. The amount of the escrow funds classified as a non-current asset is equivalent to the actual, undiscounted amount of covered litigation payments expected to be made beyond one year from the balance sheet date for settled claims. The amount of the escrow was determined by the litigation committee. The litigation committee was established pursuant to the litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International and the members of the litigation committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. In December 2008, the Company filed a Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The amendment enabled the Company to, under certain conditions, deposit operating cash directly into the escrow account resulting in a further reduction in the conversion rate applicable to the Companys class B common stock. Subsequent to the initial funding, the Company made additional deposits of operating cash into the escrow account, which had the effect of the Company repurchasing its common stock as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009    October 2010 (1)   May 2010   July 2009   December 2008    (in millions except per share data and conversion rate)  Funding under the plan  $ 800   $ 500   $ 700   $ 1,100  Repurchase price per share (2)  $ 72.74   $ 74.22   $ 60.45   $ 52.88  Equivalent shares of class A common stock repurchased   11    7    12    21  Conversion rate after funding of class B common stock to class A common stock   0.5102    0.5550    0.5824    0.6296  As-converted class B common stock after funding   125    136    143    155  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) On September 21, 2010, the Company announced it will deposit $800 million into the litigation escrow account.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  The following table sets forth the changes in the escrow account: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2010   Fiscal 2009    (in millions)  Balance at October 1  $ 1,715   $ 1,928  Funding under the plan   500    1,800  American Express settlement payments   (280 )   (280 ) Discover settlement payments (1)       (1,748 ) Interest earned, less applicable taxes   1    15          Balance at September 30  $ 1,936   $ 1,715  Less: Current portion of escrow account   (1,866 )   (1,365 )         Long-term portion of escrow account  $ 70   $ 350          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The Company made payments totaling $1.9 billion related to the Discover settlement during fiscal 2009. Of the $1.9 billion payment, $1.7 billion was funded through the escrow account under the plan and $145 million, $65 million of which was reimbursed by Morgan Stanley evenly over the four fiscal 2009 quarters, was funded from the Companys operating cash. ##TABLE_END An accrual for covered litigation is recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates information including funding decisions made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. The Company, at the request of the litigation committee, may conduct additional sales of class A common stock in order to increase the size of the escrow account, in which case the conversion rate of the class B common stock into class A common stock will be subject to additional dilutive adjustments to the extent of the proceeds from those sales. To the extent that amounts available under the escrow arrangement and agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Visa Inc. has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa Inc. with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation, multiplied by such banks then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Visa U.S.A. and Visa International also entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange litigation. Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .

Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Government-sponsored debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the government-sponsored debt securities is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data. There was no substantive change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2010.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. Valuations for these securities were provided by the Companys pricing vendors and are based on significant unobservable inputs. There was no substantive change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2010. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which is carried at fair value in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3Visa Europe. The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the put option. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis is not presented because the primary fiscal 2010 and 2009 activities are the liquidation of the corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities via sales and maturities, and $8 million of other-than-temporary impairment in fiscal 2009. These investments were fully liquidated by September 30, 2010 and resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1 million to investment income, net, in fiscal 2010. There was no change in fair value or other activity related to the Companys auction rate securities during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option was revalued from $346 million to $267 million in fiscal 2010, resulting in an $79 million increase to other non-operating income in fiscal 2010. See Note 3Visa Europe. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . The Company applies fair value measurement to its strategic investments which are accounted for under the cost and equity methods. Strategic investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management judgment. If events or circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions including financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. During fiscal 2010, certain events and circumstances triggered impairment analyses for certain non-marketable equity securities which resulted in recognized losses of $3 million and $7 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Due to a change in the investment relationship with one of its investees during fiscal 2010, the Company reclassified equity securities accounted for as available-for-sale investments with a cost basis of $9 million to an equity method investment. As a result, the Company also reversed net unrealized gains of $15 million, pre-tax, from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded a loss of $3 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. At September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, non-marketable equity security investments and investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $114 million and $102 million, respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7-Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets .  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Reserve Primary Fund. After the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, was unable to honor the Companys request for a full redemption of its investment in 2008, the Company began accounting for its investment in the Fund under the cost method, and considered it a Level 3 asset for which a market price is not readily determinable. The fair value was estimated by discounting the Companys pro-rata ownership of the Funds underlying investment holdings based upon an estimate of inherent risk, resulting in an impairment charge of $29 million in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009 and 2010, the Company substantially received its remaining pro-rata ownership in the Fund, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $20 million in investment income, net during fiscal 2010, for amounts received in excess of the carrying value. See Note 7Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Note 22Legal Matters for additional information regarding this asset. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any significant non-financial liabilities. During fiscal 2010 and at September 30, 2010, there was no indication that the Companys long-lived assets were impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of Visas tradename, customer relationships, and Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived assets as of July 1, 2010 and concluded there was no impairment.

Note 6CyberSource Acquisition On July 21, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants. The combination was executed to accelerate the growth of Visas eCommerce category and enhance the value of the Companys network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. Total purchase consideration was approximately $2.0 billion, paid with cash on hand as follows: ##TABLE_START   (in millions)  Acquisition of approximately 72 million shares of outstanding common stock of CyberSource at $26.00 per share  $ 1,866  Fair value of earned stock options settled   86      Total purchase price  $ 1,952      ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of purchase consideration over net assets assumed was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value that is expected from expanding the Companys online payment and related fraud and security management capabilities, and other synergies. The $1.2 billion of additional goodwill represents the only activity to the Companys goodwill during the fiscal year. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $0.8 billion was allocated to a second reporting unit. The remainder was allocated to the Companys original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to the Companys existing business. None of the additional goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation, which is preliminary pending finalization of the valuation analysis. ##TABLE_START   (in millions)  Tangible assets and liabilities  Current assets  $ 259  Non-current assets   150  Current liabilities   (45 ) Non-current liabilities   (256 ) Intangible assets   605  Goodwill   1,239      Net assets acquired  $ 1,952      ##TABLE_END Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, reseller relationships and tradenames, which have useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years.

See Note 18Share-based Compensation . The Company also expensed as incurred approximately $13 million of acquisition-related costs during fiscal 2010, which consisted primarily of professional fees related to closing the transaction.

During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a $29 million other-than-temporary impairment against the Companys original investment of $982 million when the Fund failed to honor the Companys request for a full redemption of its investment. The Company received distributions totaling $89 million and $884 million from the Fund in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, which substantially represented the Companys remaining pro-rata ownership in the Fund. Total distributions received were in excess of the carrying value of the Companys investment in the Fund, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $20 million in investment income, net during fiscal 2010. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 22Legal Matters.

The note is collateralized by the Companys Colorado facility, which consists of two data centers and an office building, in addition to processing assets and developed software. 8.28% Secured Notes-Series B and 7.83% Secured Notes-Series B In September 1994 and September 1995, a real estate partnership owned jointly by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International issued notes that are secured by certain office properties and facilities used by the Company in California, known as the 1994 Lease Agreement and 1995 Lease Agreement, respectively. Series B of each of these notes, totaling $26 million and $27 million, respectively, was issued with a stated maturity of September 23, 2014 and September 15, 2015, respectively. These notes are payable monthly with interest-only payments for the first ten years and payments of interest and principal for the remainder of the term. In May 2008, amendments for both of these lease agreements were executed under which remaining obligations are guaranteed by Visa Inc. The amendment to the 1994 Lease Agreement also stipulates that the interest rate will be adjusted upward if the long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Visa Inc. falls below certain stipulated levels.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  U.S. Commercial Paper Program Visa International maintains a U.S. commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. This program allows the Company to issue up to $500 million of unsecured debt securities, with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance and at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The Company had no outstanding obligations under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009. Revolving Credit Facilities In 2008, Visa Inc. entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the February 2008 Agreement). The February 2008 Agreement matures on February 15, 2013 and contains covenants and events of defaults customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in this revolving credit facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Companys class B and class C common stock, and certain of the Companys clients or affiliates of its clients. This revolving credit facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by its clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. The Company also agrees to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on the Companys credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Note 12Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans which provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plan The defined benefit pension plan benefits are based on years of service, age, and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Effective October 1, 2008, the pension plan was amended to provide death benefits of 100% of the value of the accrued benefit to a participants beneficiary or estate. Prior to this amendment, the plan provided a 50% death benefit only to a participants spouse. On January 12, 2010, the Company approved an amendment to the pension plan to conform the plan to the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The combined effects of the resulting plan remeasurement, as well as the completion of the annual census data update, reduced fiscal 2010 net periodic pension cost by $19 million. Effective August 1, 2010, participation in the plan was extended to former employees of CyberSource following its acquisition by the Company in July 2010. See Note 6CyberSource Acquisition . The additional participants are not expected to materially increase the fiscal 2010 or future annual pension cost. Postretirement Benefits Plan The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis. In August 2008, the Company amended its postretirement benefits plan to discontinue the employer subsidy for all participants not yet retirement eligible at December 31, 2008, resulting in a curtailment gain of $2 million in fiscal 2008.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Pension Plan Assets Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80%, fixed income securities of 25% to 35%, and other, primarily consisting of cash to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7%. At September 30, 2010, plan asset allocations for the above categories were 64%, 30% and 6% respectively, and within these allocation ranges. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2010, reflecting unsettled transactions: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measurements at September 30, 2010    Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total    (in millions)  Cash equivalents  $ 46   $ 1    $ 47  Collective investment funds    307     307  Corporate debt securities    99     99  Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies    111     111  Asset backed securities    $ 26    26  Equity securities   190      190                  Total  $ 236   $ 518   $ 26   $ 780                  ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents . Securities classified as Level 1 primarily include money market funds traded in active markets. Valuations for these securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Securities classified as Level 2 include a government agency discount note, which is a short-term obligation issued at discount from par. This security is traded over-the-counter and the valuation is based on inputs derived from observable market data of related assets. Collective investment funds. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefits plans, to invest in portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Although the single collective investment fund held by the plan is ultimately invested in the common stocks of companies in the SP 500 index, its own unit value is not directly observable, and it is therefore classified as Level 2. Corporate debt securities. Securities in this category primarily include fixed income securities issued by domestic and foreign corporations. Valuation for these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, and are generally classified as Level 2.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies . These securities primarily include debt issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and securities issued or backed by U.S. government agencies. Valuations for these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market. These investments are generally classified within Level 2. Asset backed securities. Asset backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Valuations for these securities are based on significant unobservable inputs. These investments are classified as Level 3. Equity securities . Securities are classified as Level 1 and include securities regularly traded on a security exchange. These securities are valued at their last quoted sales price at the reporting date, or if there was no sale on that day, the last reported bid price. This category also includes mutual funds, which are classified as Level 1, as their net asset values are observable in the market, and the access to the investment is not restricted. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2010. The following table provides a roll-forward of Level 3 investments in fiscal 2010: ##TABLE_START   Asset backed securities    (in millions)  Balance at October 1, 2009  $ 28  Actual return on plan assets:  Assets held at reporting date   2  Assets sold during the period     Transfers in or / and (out) of Level 3     Purchases, sales and settlementsnet   (4 )     Balance at September 30, 2010  $ 26      ##TABLE_END Cash Flows ##TABLE_START   Pension Benefits   Other Postretirement Benefits  Actual employer contributions  (in millions)  2010  $ 62   $ 4  2009   166    4  Expected employer contributions   2011  $ 55   $ 4  Expected benefit payments   2011  $ 102   $ 4  2012   95    4  2013   90    4  2014   90    4  2015   82    4  2016-2020   361    16  ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Other Benefits The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of its employees residing in the United States. Personnel costs included $29 million, $28 million and $33 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the plan. The Companys contributions to this plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 13Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, deposit access products, point-of-sale check service drivers and other instruments processed in accordance with the operating regulations. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited. Settlement at risk (or exposure) is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company refined its settlement risk policy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to reduce the number of safety margin days when calculating U.S. settlement exposure, and to increase the U.S. debit and credit exposure thresholds for which collateral is required. The Companys estimated maximum settlement exposure was approximately $38.7 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $41.8 billion at September 30, 2009. Of these amounts, $3.0 billion at September 30, 2010 and $3.7 billion at September 30, 2009, are covered by collateral. Had the changes to the settlement risk policy been applied to the prior year, the estimated maximum settlement exposure would have been approximately $33.9 billion at September 30, 2009, of which approximately $2.8 billion would have been covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below are greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeds the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START   September 30, 2010   September 30, 2009    (in millions)  Cash equivalents  $ 899   $ 812  Pledged securities at market value   470    243  Letters of credit   869    703  Guarantees   1,803    2,644          Total  $ 4,041   $ 4,402          ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Companys name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries, and the Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). The estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009 and is reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 14Derivative Financial Instruments The functional currency for the Company is the U.S. dollar (USD) for the majority of its foreign operations. The Company transacts business in USD and in various foreign currencies. This activity subjects the Company to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys policy is to enter into foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to manage the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. At September 30, 2010, all derivative instruments outstanding mature within 12 months or less. The Company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued liabilities and the resulting gains or losses from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge certain operational (cash flow) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of forecasted revenues and expenses being denominated in or based on currencies other than USD. In fiscal 2009, the Company implemented a rolling hedge strategy program. Under this strategy, the Company seeks to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of the Companys foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in its exchange rate risk management program was $627 million and $742 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $627 million outstanding at September 30, 2010 is fully consistent with the Companys strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from the Companys forecast. As of September 30, 2010, the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $5 million and are classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $56 million and are classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between hedging transactions and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported immediately in earnings. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the amount by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points and ineffectiveness was $18 million, $18 million and $2 million, respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net was $40 million at September 30, 2010 and the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount to earnings in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal 2011 due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions. In the event there is recognized ineffectiveness or the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the designated hedge period, or it becomes remote that the forecasted transaction will occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet to administrative and other expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2010. Note 15Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic area as follows: ##TABLE_START   September 30, 2010   September 30, 2009    (in millions)  U.S.  $ 1,301   $ 1,128  Non-U.S.   56    76          Total  $ 1,357   $ 1,204          ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Certain revenues, primarily international service revenues, are shared by geographic locations based upon the location of the merchant involved in the transaction. Other than the U.S., Visa does not maintain revenues by individual country. Revenues earned in the U.S. was approximately 58%, 58% and 59% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues are concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. Revenues from the Companys top five clients were approximately 30%, 32% and 26% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In fiscal 2009, one customer accounted for 10% of the Companys net operating revenues. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2008. See Item 1ARisk Factors. Note 16Stockholders Equity Reorganization, IPO and Redemptions. As part of the October 2007 reorganization and a subsequent true-up adjustment prior to the March 2008 IPO, the Company issued different regional classes and series of common stock reflecting the different rights and obligations of the Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe. In the March 2008 IPO, the Company issued approximately 447 million shares of class A common stock at a net offering price of $42.77 (the IPO price of $44.00 per share of class A common stock, less underwriting discounts and commissions of $1.23 per share). Of the net $19.1 billion IPO proceeds received, $13.4 billion was used to partially redeem shares of class B and class C common stock and $3.0 billion was used to fund the litigation escrow account as discussed below. The IPO also triggered the redemption feature of certain series of class C common stock issued to Visa Europe. In March 2008, the Company reclassified these shares and other redeemable shares, to temporary equity and liability, respectively. In October 2008, the Company redeemed these shares for approximately $2.6 billion. Following the redemption and adoption of the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in December 2008, the series designation related to the remaining shares of class C common stock was removed. Class B Common Stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the later of March 25, 2011 or the date on which all of the covered litigation has been finally resolved, although the Companys board of directors may make exceptions to this transfer restriction after resolution of all covered litigation. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa member or similar person or affiliate of a Visa member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Funding of the litigation escrow account. Immediately following the IPO in March 2008, the conversion rate applicable to class B common stock was reduced to 0.7143 share of class A common stock for each share of class B common stock to reflect the initial deposit of $3.0 billion into the escrow  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  account. Further adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. The adoption of the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in December 2008 provides the Company greater flexibility to fund the escrow account, which the Company has done with various deposits into the escrow account during fiscal 2010 and 2009. The conversion rate applicable to class B common stock outstanding at September 30, 2010 is 0.5550 share of class A common stock, per class B common stock. Subsequent to the fiscal 2010 year end, on October 8, 2010, the Company funded the escrow account with an additional $800 million, which further reduced the conversion rate applicable to class B common stock outstanding from 0.5550 to 0.5102 share of class A common stock per share of class B common stock. This funding had the effect of a repurchase by the Company of the equivalent of approximately 11 million shares of class A common stock. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan . After giving effect to the October 2010 escrow funding and the corresponding reduction in the conversion rate applicable to class B common stock outstanding, the number of shares of each class and the number of shares of class A common stock outstanding, on an as-converted basis, are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions except conversion rate)  Shares Outstanding at September 30, 2010   Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock   Class A Common Stock As Converted at September 30, 2010 (1)   After giving effect to the October 2010 escrow account funding      Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock   Class A Common Stock As Converted (1)  Class A common stock   493        493        493  Class B common stock   245    0.5550    136    0.5102    125  Class C common stock   97    1.0000    97    1.0000    97                 727     716  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Figures may not sum due to rounding.

On April 27, 2009, the Companys board of directors approved a program in which holders of class C common stock were permitted to liquidate up to 30% of their class C common stock between July 1, 2009 and September 30, 2009, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under this program, 40 million shares of class C common stock were released from transfer restrictions. On January 21, 2010, the Companys board of directors approved a second class C share release program in which the number of shares released from transfer restrictions for any holders of class C common stock was the greater of (a) 50% of the restricted shares of class C common stock held by that stockholder as of March 1, 2010, and (b) 5,000 shares of  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  class C common stock (or in the case of stockholders with fewer than 5,000 shares of class C common stock, all of their shares). Stockholder application was not required. Under this program, 56 million shares of class C common stock were released from transfer restrictions. The release of these shares did not increase the number of outstanding shares on an as-converted basis, and there was no dilutive effect to the outstanding class A common stock share count on an as-converted basis from these transactions. Of the 96 million shares of class C common stock released from transfer restrictions, 55 million shares have been converted from class C common stock to class A common stock upon the sale or transfer by the holders of class C common stock into the public market through September 30, 2010. At September 30, 2010, 55 million shares of class C common stock remain subject to the general transfer restrictions that expire on March 25, 2011 under Visas amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will not be transferable or convert into class A common stock until such date. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class C common stock. The Companys board of directors may make additional exceptions to this transfer restriction. After termination of the restrictions, the class C common stock will convert into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not, immediately after the reorganization, a Visa member. In connection with such a transfer, each share of class C common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and similar transactions. Share repurchase plan. In October 2009, the Companys board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan that was to be in place through September 30, 2010. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 12.9 million shares of its class A common stock at an average price of $77.48 per share, using the entire $1.0 billion of authorized funds. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. In October 2010, the Companys board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of the Companys board of directors. Special IPO Cash and Stock Dividends Received from Cost Method Investees. Several of the Companys cost method investees are also holders of class C common stock and elected to declare a special cash dividend to return to their owners on a pro rata basis, the proceeds received as a result of the redemption of a portion of their class C common stock. As a result of the Companys ownership interest in these cost method investees, the Company recorded approximately $1 million, $2 million and $29 million of special cash dividends received from these investees during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the Company received 24,449 and 525,443 shares of its own class C common stock during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, from similar cost method investees and recorded $1 million and $35 million, respectively, as treasury stock. This treasury stock was retired in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and the Company has no class C common treasury stock outstanding at September 30, 2010. These special cash and stock dividends are recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital, net of tax, and are not recorded as income in the consolidated statements of operations as they represent the same redemption proceeds and shares issued by the Company as part of the reorganization. Any value recorded upon their return would be the result of appreciation in the  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Companys own stock, which is therefore not recorded as income. The value of the treasury stock was calculated based on other class C common stock transactions by other holders of class C common stock with unrelated third parties. Preferred Stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009. Voting Rights. The holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. All holders of class B and class C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any consolidation, merger, combination or any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the holders of class B and class C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or class C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends Declared. On October 20, 2010, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) to be paid on December 7, 2010 to all holders of record of the Companys class A, class B and class C common stock as of November 19, 2010. The Company declared and paid $368 million in dividends in fiscal 2010 at a quarterly rate of $0.125 per share. Note 17Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class and series by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units during the period. Net income is allocated to each class and series of common stock based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted number of shares of each class and series of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods. See Note 16Stockholders Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period, consisting of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of class B and class C common stock based on the conversion rate in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company adopted a new accounting standard which requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Companys restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, to be included as participating securities in computing earnings per share. Comparable prior period earnings per  VISA INC.

As a result of this adoption, fiscal 2009 basic earnings per share for class A and class C common stock decreased from $3.11 (previously reported) to $3.10.

Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of actual and trended forfeiture data and employee attrition rates. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of $135 million, $115 million and $74 million, respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statement of operations. Of the $135 million share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010, $4 million relates to expense recognized upon the CyberSource acquisition that was paid in cash. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation expense is immaterial during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. On July 21, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberSource Corporation at a price of $26.00 per share. In connection with the acquisition, the Company terminated the non-vested in-the-money options held by CyberSource employees on the acquisition date and replaced them with approximately 1.6 million of the Companys options. These replacement awards have a weighted average exercise price of $47.34 per share, which is calculated by multiplying the original weighted average grant price to the ratio of the Companys closing stock price on the trading day immediately preceding the acquisition date to the per share acquisition price of $26.00. The replacement awards will vest over a period of three years from the original grant date of the CyberSource options, or in general, less than three years. These replacement awards are subject to the terms of the EIP and will not be counted against the original 59,000,000 authorized share pool. During fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START   2010 (5)   2009   2008  Expected term (in years) (1)   3.46    5.69    5.79  Risk-free rate of return (2)   1.4 %   2.7 %   2.6 % Expected volatility (3)   36.4 %   44.2 %   36.1 % Expected dividend yield (4)   0.7 %   0.7 %   1.0 % Weighted-average fair value per option granted  $ 29.46   $ 23.54   $ 15.34  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Based on a set of peer companies who issued awards with similar terms. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Based on the average of the Companys implied and historical volatility.

There were no options exercised during fiscal 2008. As of September 30, 2010, there was $71 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The total fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2010 and 2009 was $32 million and $78 million, respectively. There were no RSAs or RSUs vested in fiscal 2008.  VISA INC.

Performance-based Shares For performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2010, the ultimate number of shares earned will be between zero and 203,006, depending on the Companys achievement of specified cumulative net income performance targets, and the Companys stock price ranked against the total shareholder return of companies that are included in the Standard  Poors 500 Index during the approximate two-year period beginning October 28, 2009. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model, was $88.06 per share. Of the performance shares granted in fiscal 2009, 295,736 shares were earned based on the Companys achievement of specified adjusted net income performance targets during the one-year period ended September 30, 2009. The fiscal 2009 grants did not include additional performance conditions. Compensation expense for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance and recorded net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. Performance shares vest in two equal installments approximately two and three years from the date of the grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions.

For these obligations, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to fixed payments stated above, certain sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly in excess of the actual costs incurred by the Company. Volume and Support Incentives The Company has agreements with clients for various programs designed to build payments volume and increase the acceptance of its products. These agreements, with original terms ranging from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, and/or conversion, volume targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  encourage customer business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment volume, thereby reducing unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are included on the balance sheet. Obligations under these customer agreements are amortized as a reduction to revenue in the same period as the related revenues are earned, based on managements estimate of the customers performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of customer incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue for volume and support incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2010: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   Thereafter   Total  Volume and support incentives  $ 1,575   $ 1,515   $ 1,318   $ 895   $ 539   $ 458   $ 6,300  ##TABLE_END The actual amounts that are recorded will be greater or less than the estimates above due to customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed this estimate, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other clients pursuant to which the Company may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services Visa provides or otherwise relating to the Companys performance under the applicable agreement. In October 2010, one of the Companys processing clients tendered a contractual indemnity claim to Visa relating to the Companys customer call center operational practices. Visas agreement with this client provides for contractual indemnity up to approximately $3 million and the Company has reserved for this amount in fiscal 2010. However, the processing client asserts that the Company is responsible for additional amounts. The likelihood of losses that may become payable to this processing client under such claims (or to cardholders or others under additional claims they may bring in connection with the Companys call center operations) and the amount of potential losses associated with such claims cannot be determined or estimated at this time and the Company has therefore not established any additional accounting reserve for them. Note 20Related Parties Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this Note 20 if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10%; or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. There were no material operating expenses incurred during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, or material amounts due to or from related parties at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009.  VISA INC.

The Company generated total operating revenues of approximately $597 million, $786 million and $538 million from clients represented on its board of directors during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains banking relationships and has credit facilities with clients that have representation on the board of directors. See Note 11Debt . During fiscal 2008, one of the Companys directors, and the spouse of another of the Companys directors, were officers of entities that participated in (or were affiliated with an entity that participated in) the IPO as underwriters, and one of those entities was also a client. As underwriters, each was offered and purchased 113 million shares of class A common stock at a price of $42.77 per share, the same as that paid by all underwriters in the IPO. As underwriters, each also received total underwriter fees of $139 million in March 2008. Investees. The Company generated total operating revenues of $27 million, $56 million and $39 million, and received dividend income of $2 million, $41 million and $65 million from related party investees during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also received special IPO dividends from certain related party investees which are included in the amounts discussed in Note 16Stockholders Equity. Note 21Income Taxes The Companys income before taxes by fiscal year consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009   2008    (in millions)  U.S.  $ 3,973   $ 3,807   $ 1,245  Non-U.S.   665    193    91              Total income before taxes and minority interest  $ 4,638   $ 4,000   $ 1,336              ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2010 U.S. income before taxes of $4.0 billion includes $1.1 billion from non-U.S. clients.

The increase in the deferred tax liability for intangibles is primarily related to the acquisition of CyberSource in fiscal 2010. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets recorded.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  As of September 30, 2010, the Company had $217 million federal and $137 million state net operating loss carryforwards from CyberSource available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2013 through 2029. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Although the Companys ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards was limited in fiscal 2010, the Company expects to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2010, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $6 million and $21 million, respectively. The federal carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2017 through 2028. The state carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $1 million, which do not expire. The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years. The income tax expense differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% to pretax income, as a result of the following: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended September 30    2010   2009   2008    Dollars   Percent   Dollars   Percent   Dollars   Percent    (in millions)  U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate  $ 1,623    35 %  $ 1,400    35 %  $ 467    35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   177    4 %   156    4 %   43    3 % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit   (124 )   (2 )%   7        13    1 % Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation   2        4        103    8 % Other, net   9        30    1 %   21    2 % Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to change in state apportionment   15                (115 )   (9 )% Non-U.S. tax on sale of VisaNet do Brasil, net of federal benefit           51    1 %         Revaluation of Visa Europe put option   (28 )   (1 )%                                         Income tax expense  $ 1,674    36 %  $ 1,648    41 %  $ 532    40 %                         ##TABLE_END The difference between the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of the Companys global income; the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, the Companys largest operating hub outside the U.S.; the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2010; and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of the investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 differs from that for fiscal 2008 primarily due to the additional non-U.S. tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of the investment in VisaNet do Brasil, the litigation tax reserves in fiscal 2008, and a rate reduction in fiscal 2008 from the combined effect of the loss of a California special deduction upon IPO and the deferred tax remeasurement benefit from the change in state tax apportionment. Income taxes receivable of $140 million and $135 million are included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 7Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2010 and 2009, income taxes payable of $40 million and $23 million,  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  respectively, are included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $423 million and $304 million, respectively, are included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 10Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries amounted to $974 million at September 30, 2010, all of which are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the U.S. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practically determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the U.S. is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2014, and may be extended through September 30, 2023, if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentive agreement is conditional upon certain employment and investment thresholds being met by the Company. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $93 million in fiscal 2010 and $16 million in fiscal 2009. The benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.13 in fiscal 2010 and $0.02 in fiscal 2009. In accordance with ASC 740, the Company is required to inventory, evaluate, and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $545 million and $439 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $545 million and $439 million are $443 million and $397 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009    (in millions)  Beginning balance at October 1  $ 439   $ 407  Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years   65    14  Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year   44    23  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements       (4 ) Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits related to lapsing statute of limitations   (3 )   (1 )         Ending balance at September 30  $ 545   $ 439          ##TABLE_END It is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and administrative and other, respectively, in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $37 million, $17 million and $2 million of interest expense, respectively, and $5 million, $4 million and a de minimis amount of penalties, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company had accrued interest of $58 million and $22 million, respectively, and accrued penalties of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  The Company believes that unrecognized tax benefits may possibly decrease by $50 million within the next 12 months, due to the possible effective settlement on the timing of certain deductions, which would not impact the effective tax rate. The Companys fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. The Company has concluded all California income tax matters for years through fiscal 2003. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. Note 22Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The Company recorded litigation provisions of approximately ($45 million), $2 million and $1,470 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers litigation (discussed in Other Litigation below). The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals for certain legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. There was no other significant provision activity to offset the credit balance in fiscal 2010. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on managements understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation for both covered and other non-covered litigation for the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009    (in millions)  Balance at October 1  $ 1,717   $ 3,758  Provision for settled legal matters   (45 )   (1 ) Provision for unsettled legal matters       3  Settlement obligation refunded by Morgan Stanley (1)       65  Interest accretion on settled matters   27    93  Payments on settled matters (2)   (1,002 )   (2,201 )         Balance at September 30  $ 697   $ 1,717          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1 ) This balance represents the amount of a settlement refunded to the Company during fiscal 2009 by Morgan Stanley under a separate agreement. ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  ##TABLE_START (2) This amount includes the Companys October 2009 prepayment of its remaining $800 million in payment obligations in the Retailers litigation at a discounted amount of $682 million. ##TABLE_END Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings discussed below that are subject to the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 4Retrospective Responsibility Plan . An accrual for covered litigation is recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination the Company evaluates available information, including funding decisions made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. The Discover Litigation On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard). The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was designated as a related case to a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 1998. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the implementation and enforcement of Visas bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards Competitive Programs Policy, or CPP, which prohibited their respective members from issuing American Express or Discover cards violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Californias Unfair Competition Law, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys fees and costs. On October 13, 2008, Visa, MasterCard and Discover reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. The parties executed a final settlement agreement on October 27, 2008 that became effective on November 4, 2008 upon approval by holders of Visas class B common stock. Visas net share of the settlement totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1.74 billion was paid over four quarters from the escrow account established by the retrospective responsibility plan. Visa Inc. also paid $80 million toward Visas share in connection with releases obtained from MasterCard with respect to certain potential claims. Visa Inc. also paid an additional $65 million, which was refunded by Morgan Stanley, under a separate agreement related to the settlement. Visas settlement obligations were fully satisfied with the September 2009 payment to Discover. The Companys consolidated statement of operations reflects a provision of $1.8 billion for the settlement in fiscal 2008. The American Express Litigation On November 15, 2004, American Express filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard and several Visa U.S.A. and Visa International member financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of Visa U.S.A.s bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards CPP violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys fees and costs. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a settlement agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007. Under the settlement agreement, American Express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from Visa Inc.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  and $185 million from five co-defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made on March 31, 2008, including $945 million funded through the litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning April 2008, Visa Inc. will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. The quarterly settlement payments are also covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The total settlement was recorded in fiscal 2007 at a discounted value of $1.9 billion using a rate of 4.72% over the payment term. The present value of the remaining obligation is reflected in current and long-term accrued litigation obligation on the consolidated balance sheets. The quarterly payments are in an amount equal to 5% of American Expresss United States global network services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of $70 million per quarter; provided, however, that if the payment for any quarter is less than $70 million, the maximum payment for a future quarter or quarters shall be increased by the difference between $70 million and such lesser amount as was actually paid. American Express has met the performance criteria set forth in the settlement agreement for each quarter thus far, including the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010, and Visa has made each of the corresponding settlement payments. The Attridge Litigation On December 8, 2004, a complaint was filed in California state court on behalf of an alleged class of consumers asserting claims against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard under Californias Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law. The claims in this action, Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al ., seek to piggyback on the portion of the DOJ litigation in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Visas bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards CPP constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. On May 19, 2006, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs Cartwright Act claims with prejudice but allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his Unfair Competition Law claims, which seek restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees and costs. On December 14, 2007, the plaintiff amended his complaint to add Visa Inc. as a defendant. No new claims were added to the complaint. On July 1, 2009, the court denied in part the Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication, but ordered the parties to submit affidavits as to whether further discovery should be conducted prior to the court rendering judgment on the Motion for Summary Adjudication. On August 3, 2009, the court ruled the Motion submitted without any such further discovery. In the separate Indirect Purchaser Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases, also pending in California state court, Visa entered into a settlement agreement on September 14, 2009. That settlement could potentially have the effect of releasing the claims asserted in the Attridge case, subject to the ruling of the Attridge court. On September 24, 2009, the Attridge court deferred its decision on the Motion for Summary Adjudication pending court approval of the settlement in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases . On August 23, 2010, final approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement was granted. The plaintiff in Attridge and others have appealed the final approval order.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  The Interchange Litigation Kendall. On October 8, 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Visa U.S.A., MasterCard and several Visa U.S.A. member financial institutions alleging, among other things, that Visa U.S.A.s and MasterCards interchange reimbursement fees violate the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act ( Kendall v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al .). On July 25, 2005, the court granted Visa U.S.A.s motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On March 7, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal of the complaint. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a conspiracy, and that no amendment could cure the pleading defect. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were indirect purchasers of Visa U.S.A. and could not recover antitrust damages for their claims. Plaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuits ruling. Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL). Beginning in May 2005, approximately 55 complaints, all but 10 of which were styled as class actions, have been filed in U.S. federal district courts on behalf of merchants against Visa U.S.A. and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. Visa International was also named as a defendant in more than 30 of these complaints. The cases allege, among other things, that Visas and MasterCards purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their no surcharge rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees violate federal antitrust laws. On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings (MDL 1720). On April 24, 2006, the group of purported class plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint. Taken together, the claims in the First Amended Class Action Complaint and in the 10 complaints brought on behalf of individual merchants are generally brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In addition, some of these complaints contain certain state unfair competition law claims. These interchange-related cases seek money damages (alleged in the consolidated class action complaint to range in the tens of billions of dollars), subject to trebling, as well as attorneys fees and injunctive relief. As part of the retrospective responsibility plan, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a judgment sharing agreement with certain member financial institutions of Visa U.S.A. on July 1, 2007. On January 8, 2008, the district court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and granted defendants motion to dismiss the class plaintiffs claims for damages incurred prior to January 1, 2004. On January 29, 2009, class plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Among other things, this complaint: (i) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visa PIN-debit cards; (ii) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants since the time of Visas IPO regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visas credit, offline debit, and PIN-debit cards; (iii) eliminated claims for damages relating to the so-called no-surcharge rule and anti-steering rules; (iv) eliminated claims for damages based on the alleged tie of network processing services and payment guarantee services to the payment card system services; and (v) added Visa Inc. as a defendant.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  In addition, class plaintiffs filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint (the Supplemental Complaint) against Visa Inc. and several financial institutions challenging Visas reorganization and IPO under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act. In the Supplemental Complaint, class plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. On May 8, 2008, class plaintiffs served on defendants a motion seeking to certify a class of merchants. On March 31, 2009, Visa, jointly with other defendants, moved to dismiss the Supplemental Complaint and the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. The parties have exchanged expert reports and taken expert discovery. No trial date has been set. Other Litigation Retailers Litigation. Beginning in October 1996, several antitrust class action lawsuits were brought by U.S. merchants against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard. The suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . Among other claims, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa U.S.A.s Honor All Cards rule, which required merchants that accepted Visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented Visa card, and a similar MasterCard rule, constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On June 4, 2003, the parties signed a settlement agreement that was approved by the court on December 19, 2003. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Visa agreed to modify its Honor All Cards rule such that a merchant may accept only Visa check cards, only Visa credit cards, or both. Visa also agreed to pay approximately $2.0 billion to the merchant class over 10 years in equal annual installments of $200 million per year, among other things. Subject to court approval, on August 31, 2009, Visa entered into an agreement to prepay its remaining $800 million in settlement payments for $682 million. On October 2, 2009, the court entered a final order approving the prepayment agreement, and Visa made the prepayment pursuant to the agreements terms on October 5, 2009. Pursuant to its terms, the prepayment agreement became final after no appeals to the approval order were filed within the 30-day appeal period. Indirect Purchaser Actions. Complaints were also filed in 19 different states and the District of Columbia alleging state antitrust, consumer protection and common law claims against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard (and, in California, Visa International) on behalf of consumers. The claims in these class actions included allegations mirroring those made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and asserting that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs seek money damages and injunctive relief. Visa U.S.A. has been successful in the majority of these cases, as courts in 17 jurisdictions have granted Visa U.S.A.s motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaints. The court approved the voluntary dismissal of one of the consolidated cases in New Mexico on September 16, 2009. In the remaining New Mexico case, the court granted Visa U.S.A.s motion to dismiss at a hearing on May 14, 2010, and entered an order and judgment dismissing the case on June 9, 2010. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from that order and judgment on June 14, 2010.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  In California, in the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , the court dismissed claims brought under the Cartwright Act, but denied a similar motion with respect to Unfair Competition Law claims for unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices. On October 31, 2007, the court denied the plaintiffs motion to give collateral estoppel effect to certain elements of their tying claim based on statements in the ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment in In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . On October 3, 2008, the parties agreed to confidential settlement terms to resolve the dispute. On September 14, 2009, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement that was then submitted to the court for approval. After the parties amended the settlement agreement in certain respects, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on January 5, 2010 and entered an order granting final approval on August 23, 2010. The plaintiff in Attridge , who had filed objections to the settlement, has filed a notice of appeal from the final approval order, as have other objectors to the settlement. The amount of the settlement is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. New Zealand Interchange Proceedings. The Commerce Commission, New Zealands competition regulator, filed a civil Statement of Claim in the High Court in Wellington on November 9, 2006, alleging that, among other things, the fixing of default interchange rates by Cards NZ Limited, Visa International, MasterCard and certain Visa International member financial institutions contravenes the New Zealand Commerce Act. On November 27, 2006, a group of New Zealand retailers filed a nearly identical claim against the same parties before the same tribunal. Both the Commerce Commission and the retailers seek declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. Both cases were transferred to the commercial list at the High Court in Auckland in April 2007. The Commerce Commission, Visa International and Visa Worldwide Pte Ltd settled the Commerce Commission case on August 11, 2009, and the court granted leave to discontinue the claim on August 26, 2009. On October 3, 2009, Visa and the New Zealand retailers entered into an agreement to settle the retailers case, and the retailers filed a notice of discontinuance on October 7, 2009. The terms of the settlements are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Currency Conversion Litigation. In 2000, a representative action was filed in California state court against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in connection with an asserted 1% currency conversion fee assessed on member financial institutions by the payment card networks on transactions involving the purchase of goods or services in a foreign currency and the disclosure of that fee ( Schwartz ). Plaintiffs claimed Visas currency conversion practices violated California Business  Professions Code Section 17200. Additional California state class actions were filed against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International challenging currency conversion practices ( Shrieve, Mattingly , and Baker ). Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, Citicorp Diners Club, Inc. (Diners Club) and several Visa member financial institutions are also defendants in a number of federal class actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal antitrust laws based on the 1% currency conversion fee. The federal complaints were consolidated or coordinated in MDL 1409 ( In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 20, 2006, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a settlement agreement in MDL 1409. Under the terms of that settlement, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International paid $100.1 million into a settlement fund and agreed that for five years they would separately identify or itemize any fees added to transactions because they occurred in a foreign country or involved a foreign currency and would require U.S. issuing members to disclose certain changes, if any, to exchange rate practices. Visa  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  U.S.A. and Visa International also paid into the settlement fund $18.6 million in attorneys fees to resolve Schwartz . The Shrieve , Mattingly , and Baker plaintiffs agreed that they would ask the court to dismiss their actions with prejudice as to Visa U.S.A. and Visa International once the MDL 1409 settlement receives court approval. If Baker is dismissed, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International shall pay $1.0 million plus interest as attorneys fees. If Baker is not dismissed within 60 days of final approval of the MDL settlement, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International shall pay $500,000 plus interest as attorneys fees. The court granted final approval of the MDL 1409 settlement on October 22, 2009. Various appeals have been filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit challenging the district courts approval of the settlement. The issuance of refund checks for valid, timely claims will not commence until after the appeals are resolved (in favor of the court-approved settlement) and the settlement administrator has validated the claims. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter/Discover Litigation. In August 2004, the European Commission in Brussels issued a Statement of Objections against Visa International and Visa Europe alleging a breach of European competition law. The allegation arises from the Visa International and Visa Europe Rule (bylaw 2.12(b)) that makes certain designated competitors, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter/Discover, ineligible for membership. On October 3, 2007, the European Commission fined Visa International and Visa Europe  10.2 million ($14.5 million) for infringing European Union rules on restrictive business practices (Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement). Visa International and Visa Europe filed an appeal of the ruling with the Court of First Instance on December 19, 2007. A hearing on Visa International and Visa Europes appeal before the General Court (formerly known as the Court of First Instance) was held on May 20, 2010. No ruling has been issued. Pursuant to existing agreements, Visa Europe has acknowledged full responsibility for the defense of this action, including any fines that may be payable. Merchant Acceptance Rules Investigations. On October 10, 2008, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, to Visa U.S.A. that sought information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID sought documents, data and narrative responses to several interrogatories and document requests, which focused on certain merchant acceptance practices, including major payment network rules regarding merchant surcharging and merchants ability to steer customers to other forms of payment. On May 15, 2009, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Ohio issued an Investigative Demand to Visa Inc. seeking information regarding a potential violation of Chapter 1331 of the Ohio Revised Code, Ohios antitrust law. The Ohio Attorney General is part of a multistate attorney general working group. The Investigative Demand sought copies of documents, data and narrative responses that Visa had produced to the Division pursuant to the CID issued on October 10, 2008. The Investigative Demand focused on certain Visa U.S.A. policies relating to merchant acceptance practices, including Visa U.S.A.s policies regarding merchant surcharging and merchants ability to steer customers to other forms of payment. On October 4, 2010, Visa announced a settlement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of seven states to resolve their investigations. As part of the settlement, Visa will allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer customers to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to any card product, such as a non-reward Visa credit card. Visas rules  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  always have allowed U.S. merchants to steer customers to other forms of payment and offer discounts to customers who choose to pay with cash, check or PIN debit. The new rules will expand U.S. merchants ability to discount for their preferred form of payment, though they will not be able to pick and choose amongst issuing banks. The settlement agreement does not address Visas rule prohibiting U.S. merchants from surcharging consumers. Apart from a partial reimbursement to the state attorneys general of their attorneys fees and expenses, there is no monetary obligation associated with the settlement. The reimbursement amount is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The consent decree setting forth the terms of settlement is subject to court approval. Visa will make formal rule changes after the court enters a final judgment following a public comment period, but will refrain from enforcing its current discounting rules in the interim. Venezuela Interchange Proceedings. On October 2, 2008, the Superintendencia para la Promocin y Proteccin de la Libre Competencia (Competition Authority) of Venezuela filed an administrative proceeding against Visa Inc. International (sic), MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, Consorcio Credicard, and more than thirty privately held financial institutions. The Competition Authority alleges that, among other things, the defendants setting of default interchange rates and merchant discount rates violates Venezuelan competition law. The Competition Authority seeks monetary and injunctive relief. The evidentiary phase of the investigation has concluded, but the Competition Authority has not yet issued any findings as a result of the investigation. European Interchange Proceedings. On April 3, 2009, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections (SO) to Visa Europe, Visa International and Visa Inc. alleging a breach of European competition law. Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with the Statement of Objections on June 1, 2009. The SO alleges a breach of Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The SO is directed to Visa Inc. and Visa International as to Honor All Cards, the no-surcharge rule and what the Commission alleges is the subsidiary application of the Inter-Regional MIFs to the intra-regional POS transactions with consumer cards. On August 10, 2009, Visa Inc. and Visa International filed a response to the SO. On April 26, 2010, Visa Europe announced an agreement with the European Commission, subject to public consultation, to end the proceedings initiated by the Statement of Objections issued April 3, 2009, with respect to Visa Europes immediate debit interchange fees. Pursuant to existing agreements among the parties, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa International and Visa Inc. in connection with this proceeding, including payment of any fines that may be imposed. Canadian Competition Bureau Proceedings. On April 21, 2009, Visa received an oral notification from the Canadian Competition Bureau that it has initiated a civil inquiry regarding interchange and certain of Visa policies relating to merchant acceptance practices. On August 4, 2010, the Bureau issued a voluntary draft information request to Visa seeking information on certain merchant acceptance practices, interchange (including the setting of default interchange), and fees paid by issuers and acquirers to Visa. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau with respect to the information request.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Brazilian Competition Authority Proceedings. On August 7, 2009, Secretaria de Direito Econmico (SDE), the Brazilian competition agency, opened an administrative proceeding against Visa International, Visa do Brasil, and Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento (f/k/a VisaNet do Brasil) regarding an alleged exclusive relationship between the Company and VisaNet do Brasil, the then sole acquirer of Visa transactions in Brazil. SDE also issued an injunction against Visa International and Visa do Brasil requiring, among other things, that Visa grant additional acquiring licenses to Brazilian financial institutions and suspend Visas exclusive relationship with VisaNet do Brasil. The SDE administrative proceeding followed the issuance of a report by the Central Bank of Brazil suggesting, among other things, that the single-acquirer structure in Brazil be changed. Visa International and Visa do Brasil appealed the injunction to Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econmica (CADE), the Brazilian competition authority, and on September 16, 2009, CADE revoked the injunction in its entirety. On December 16, 2009, Visa International and Visa do Brasil reached an agreement with CADE for the immediate suspension of the investigation and its eventual closure without fines if certain conditions were met. On August 3, 2010, CADE formally closed the investigation against Visa International and Visa do Brasil without the imposition of any fines, concluding that both entities had fully complied with the terms of their agreement with CADE. The Reserve Primary Fund. On May 5, 2009, Visa U.S.A. commenced an action in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York against The Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, and related entities in connection with the Funds failure to promptly redeem in full Visa U.S.A.s investment in a money market mutual fund. On September 15, 2008, Visa U.S.A. sought to redeem its entire investment of over $981 million, plus accrued dividends. The Fund failed to return Visa U.S.A.s investment within one business day as required by the Funds prospectus. Pursuant to a liquidation plan, the Fund made interim distributions, returning approximately 90% of Visa U.S.A.s investment. Visa U.S.A. sought damages in excess of $98 million, the amount of its investment then held by the Fund. Also see Note 5Investments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 7Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . On May 5, 2009, the SEC commenced an action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Fund and proposed an alternative plan of liquidation. On November 25, 2009, the court accepted most aspects of the SEC plan and ordered that the remaining assets in the Fund, with the exception of a reserve for ongoing expenses and claims, be returned to investors on a pro-rata basis. In January and July 2010, Visa U.S.A. received further distributions from the Fund. Together with interim distributions, Visa U.S.A. has received a total payout of 99% of Visa U.S.A.s original investment, and any further recovery will also likely be pursuant to the SEC plan. Visa U.S.A. voluntarily dismissed its case without prejudice on March 31, 2010. CyberSource securities litigation. On April 29, 2010, an individual named Carol Ann Peters filed a class action lawsuit against CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), certain of its directors, and Visa Inc. in California Superior Court in connection with the proposed merger of CyberSource and Visa. The complaint asserts claims of breach of fiduciary duty against the CyberSource directors and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty against CyberSource and Visa. Plaintiff later added Market Street Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc., as a defendant and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys fees. A similar lawsuit was filed on May 4, 2010, by the Inter-Local Pension Fund of the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. The Delaware complaint was voluntarily  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  dismissed and re-filed in California Superior Court on June 1, 2010, adding allegations of inadequate disclosure in CyberSources preliminary proxy statement concerning the merger. On June 9, 2010, the California court consolidated the two suits, now captioned In re CyberSource Shareholder Litigation . On June 29, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. The agreement requires CyberSource to make certain additional disclosures related to the proposed merger, which were made in CyberSources definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 11, 2010, but does not require any defendant to pay money damages. A notice of the settlement, which was subject to confirmatory discovery and court approval, was filed on July 13, 2010. On September 16, 2010, following completion of confirmatory discovery, the parties filed formal settlement documents with the court. On November 10, 2010, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and directing that notice of the settlement be provided to potential class members. A final approval hearing is scheduled for January 14, 2011. The settlement is not considered material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Dynamic Currency Conversion. Visa has received notices from competition regulators in New Zealand, Australia, and Korea regarding investigations into Visas policies relating to the provision of Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) services. DCC refers to the conversion of the purchase price of goods or services from one currency to another at the point of sale, as agreed to by the cardholder and merchant. Visa is cooperating with these regulators with respect to these investigations. Data pass litigation. On August 27, 2010, a consumer filed a class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and Visa Inc. in federal district court in Connecticut. The plaintiff claims, among other things, that consumers who made online purchases at Amazon.com were deceived into also incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the alleged unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (data pass), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. Visa allegedly aided and abetted the conduct of the other defendants. Plaintiff seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Amazon.com as a defendant without prejudice on October 29, 2010. Webloyalty.com and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the case on November 1, 2010. Webloyalty.com also has asked the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation to consolidate with this case, for pretrial proceedings, a case pending in federal district court in California in which Webloyalty.com and Movietickets.com (but not Visa) are named as defendants. Gift Card Litigation Visa is a party to various lawsuits involving prepaid gift cards. Pursuant to existing agreements, Visa may be indemnified by the issuer of the gift card in question for liability associated with some or all of the claims asserted in these suits. Loiseau/Barclay. On November 24, 2009, Loiseau filed his third amended complaint. Both Visa and Metabank moved to dismiss that complaint. The court granted Visas motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice on February 10, 2010. On December 1, 2009, represented by the same counsel as Mr. Loiseau, William Barclay filed a class action against Visa U.S.A. and Metabank making similar allegations as in the Loiseau case. On December 31, 2009, Metabank removed the Barclay action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  District of California and filed a notice of relatedness between the two cases. Both Visa and Metabank moved to dismiss the Barclay complaint. Ultimately, Barclay agreed to dismiss Visa from the case and on February 25, 2010, Visa was dismissed from the case with prejudice. Matalas . On May 27, 2010, Diane Matalas filed a class action lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank and Visa Inc. in California Superior Court asserting claims under Californias gift card act and other consumer laws. Among other things, Matalas alleges that certain authorization practices for gift cards are unlawful. On July 14, 2010, Wells Fargo Bank removed the case to U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Both Visa and Metabank moved to dismiss the complaint. On September 27, 2010, all of the parties stipulated that Visa be dismissed from the case without prejudice. The plaintiff has moved to amend her complaint, dropping Visa as a defendant. Intellectual Property Litigation Vale Canjeable On November 21, 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A. filed an action in the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas (Fifth Municipal court), Venezuela against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the Visa Vale mark in Venezuela. In December 2006, the plaintiff also filed a claim with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas (First Instance court), alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiffs rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting declarative, injunctive and monetary relief. On November 29, 2006, the Fifth Municipal court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the Vale in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers. On December 6, 2006, Visa International filed a constitutional objection to that ruling. The objection was dismissed, and Visa International appealed the decision through the appellate courts. On September 25, 2007, Visa Internationals request for removal of the First Instance judge from the case was granted. A new judge was assigned to finalize the discovery phase of the case. After all appeals to the lower appellate courts had been rejected, on March 14, 2008, Visa International filed an extraordinary appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling with the Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court). On August 6, 2008, the Supreme Court accepted Visa Internationals appeal and declared the lower courts decision null and void. Pursuant to the Supreme Courts order, on March 25, 2009, the First Commercial Judge of Appeals of Caracas issued a new decision. The decision (i) dismissed Visa Internationals appeal; (ii) ratified the preliminary injunction; and (iii) found Visa and Todoticket liable for legal fees and costs in connection with the appeal. On July 9, 2009, Visa International filed a further appeal, and on December 10, 2009, the Supreme Court again decided in Visas favor, overturning the appellate ruling. The Supreme Court ordered a new Judge of Appeals to consider the preliminary injunction that prevented Visa from using the Visa Vale trademark in Venezuela. No decision has yet been issued by the new Judge of Appeals. On February 11, 2010, in a separate action on the merits, the First Instance court dismissed in its entirety the plaintiffs claim against Visa International and other defendants for damages based on trademark infringement. The plaintiff is appealing the decision.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2010 (in millions, except as noted)  Every Penny Counts, Inc.Prepaid Cards On July 17, 2007, Every Penny Counts, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Visa U.S.A., MasterCard and American Express for patent infringement. Plaintiff amended its complaint on September 27, 2007 to add Green Dot Corp. as a party and to add a patent to its suit. The complaint now alleges that the defendants open prepaid card products infringe five U.S. Patents held by the plaintiff. After the court denied Visa U.S.A.s motion to dismiss, on November 13, 2007, Visa U.S.A. filed its answer and counterclaims alleging that Visa does not infringe the plaintiffs patents, that the plaintiffs patents are invalid, and that the plaintiffs patents are unenforceable due to prosecution laches and inequitable conduct. At a claims construction hearing on May 22, 2008, the court ruled in favor of defendants on all five of plaintiffs patents. In light of this ruling, plaintiff orally agreed to a stipulated judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims. The court entered judgment for all defendants on May 23, 2008, which was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on April 30, 2009. The Federal Circuit denied Every Penny Countss petition for rehearing on May 26, 2009 and issued its mandate on June 2, 2009. Judgment was entered pursuant to that mandate on June 10, 2009. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Every Penny Countss petition for writ of certiorari on November 9, 2009.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2010 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors in this report. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2010. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this Report.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2010, there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business ##TABLE_END Overview Visa Inc., which we refer to as Visa or the Company, is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments in more than 200 countries and territories, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. Our business primarily consists of the following: ##TABLE_START    we own, manage and promote a portfolio of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including Visa, Visa Electron, PLUS and Interlink, which we license to our clients for use in their payment programs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we offer a wide range of branded payments product platforms, which our clients, primarily financial institutions, use to develop and offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for their customers (individuals, businesses and government entities); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we provide transaction processing and value-added services to our clients through VisaNet, Visa Debit Processing Services, Visa Processing Services, CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we promote and enforce a common set of operating regulations adhered to by our clients to ensure the efficient and secure functioning of our payments network and the maintenance and promotion of our brands. ##TABLE_END To ensure our long-term success and the success of our clients: ##TABLE_START    we invest in new services and processing platforms to facilitate more convenient and innovative payment methods, such as mobile payments, money transfer and eCommerce; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    we continually improve the speed, efficiency, security and performance of our network and our payments services to enhance the reliability of our global processing infrastructure and protect the security of cardholder information. ##TABLE_END We operate an open-loop payments network, a multi-party system in which Visa connects financial institutionsissuing financial institutions, or issuers, that issue cards to cardholders, and acquiring financial institutions, or acquirers, that have the banking relationship with merchantsand manage the exchange of information and value between them. As such, Visa does not issue cards, extend credit, or collect, assess or set cardholder fees or interest charges. In most instances, cardholder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our network of financial institution clients. We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services that we provide. Business developments in fiscal 2011 included the following: ##TABLE_START    Regulation . New rules were set out with respect to debit products under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Reform Act. The Reform Act regulates, among other things, interchange fees, the debit networks issuers make available, merchants choices among these networks and transaction routing. These regulations will cause us to renegotiate some portions of client contracts. See Government Regulation below . ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    U.S. Debit Strategy. We have designed or implemented several modifications to our U.S. debit strategy to ensure compliance with the Reform Act. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Interchange. We established new debit interchange rate structures, effective October 2011, for the Visa Consumer Check card, Interlink and Small Business Debit. Two ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  distinct interchange schedules were established: one for exempt issuers and products, and a second for regulated issuers and products. In addition, in order to ensure that transactions within a U.S. territory, transactions between U.S. territories, and transactions between the U.S. and U.S. territories receive the applicable, regulated interchange rate, we established two new interregional schedules for regulated debit card and Interlink transactions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Certification Program. In order to correctly identify regulated issuers, their exempt products and their compliance with the Federal Reserves interim fraud prevention standards, a certification process was implemented for regulated issuers. The program enables issuers to accurately register their exempt and non-exempt portfolios and to certify their compliance with these rules and criteria. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rule Changes. We implemented changes to our Operating Regulations to the extent necessary to support the ability of issuers to enable unaffiliated payment card networks on Visa Debit cards issued in the U.S. or U.S. territories, as well as to enable Visa-owned debit networks on non-Visa Debit cards. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Fees. We announced acquirer pricing restructuring designed to reduce overall merchant costs in connection with accepting Visa transactions. These changes are intended to incent merchants to route more transactions over the Visa network. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Department of Justice. Visa Inc. reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the attorneys general of several states to resolve antitrust investigations into our merchant acceptance rules in the United States. As part of the settlement, we now allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer customers to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to another card product, such as a non-reward Visa credit card. Our rules always have allowed U.S. merchants to steer customers to other forms of payment and offer discounts to customers who choose to pay with cash, check or debit when authorized by a personal identification number, or PIN. The new rules thus expand U.S. merchants ability to discount for their preferred form of payment, though they may not pick and choose among issuing banks. The settlement does not address our rule prohibiting U.S. merchants from surcharging consumers who pay with Visa. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Client Contracts. We continued to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth by successfully renewing several major client contracts throughout the year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Ongoing Growth. The progress towards economic recovery and secular shift from cash and checks to electronic payments helped to drive double-digit growth across our three primary revenue driverspayments volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactionswhich contributed to our 14% growth in year-over-year net operating revenues for fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_END Industry Overview The Global Payments Industry We operate in the global payments industry, which is undergoing a powerful secular shift towards card-based and other electronic payments and away from paper-based payments, such as cash and checks. For more than 50 years, we have played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers, businesses, governments and merchants. We believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms. We also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency, control and security, and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience.  The global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer, including: ##TABLE_START    paper-based paymentscash, personal checks, money orders, government checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    card-based paymentscredit cards, charge cards, debit cards, deferred debit cards, ATM cards, prepaid cards, private label cards and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    mobile paymentselectronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications such as text messages, mobile billing, web browsers or applications, contactless readers, or other means; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    other electronic paymentswire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house payments and other forms of electronic payment not typically tied to a payment card or similar access device. ##TABLE_END The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose cards, which offer widespread merchant acceptance. General purpose cards are typically categorized as: ##TABLE_START    pay now cards, such as debit cards, which enable the cardholder to purchase goods and services by an automatic debit to a checking, demand deposit or other account with accessible funds; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pay later cards, such as credit, deferred debit and charge cards, which typically permit a cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit or deferred debit account or require payment of the full balance within a specified period; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pay before cards, such as prepaid cards, which are pre-funded up to a certain monetary value. ##TABLE_END Primary general purpose card brands include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club. While these brands, including Visa, were historically associated with consumer credit or charge cards in the United States and other major international markets, we and others have, over time, broadened our offerings to include debit, ATM, prepaid and commercial payment products. Our Core Operations We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services we provide. Our clients deliver Visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on product platforms we define and manage. Payments network management is a core part of our operations, as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe, efficient, consistent and interoperable service to cardholders, merchants and financial institutions worldwide. Transaction Processing Services Processing Infrastructure We own and operate VisaNet, which consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the United States. In addition, Visa Europe operates processing centers in the United Kingdom, which is part of our synchronized system, in accordance with the terms of our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. These centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. Intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services.  VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added information, such as risk scoring or loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our system. CyberSource, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc., operates multiple data centers in the United States and internationally. These secure data center facilities allow for high availability transaction services and connectivity to the Internet, clients and processing partners. Core Processing Services Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between Visa issuers and acquirers. In addition, we offer a range of value-added processing services to support our clients Visa programs and to promote the growth and security of our payments network. Authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed. Clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholders account, the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction, and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies. Settlement is the process of calculating, determining, reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared. The issuer and acquirer involved in a typical Visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor. For example, the acquirer credits the merchants account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer. In addition, the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment, in the case of a credit or deferred debit card, or collects payment directly from the cardholders deposit account, in the case of a debit card. We process most Visa transactions occurring in the United States. We also process most Visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries, which we refer to as cross-border transactions. In many countries outside the United States, domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems, generally by government-controlled payments networks, our clients, independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients. We perform clearing and settlement through VisaNet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in Visa Europes region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world, or vice versa. Visa Europe authorizes, clears and settles transactions for its members through its own processing system. Other Value-Added Processing Services We offer a range of other value-added services in certain countries, including risk management, issuer processing, loyalty, dispute management, value-added information and CyberSource-branded services. Risk Management Services . We provide clients in certain countries with a number of value-added risk-management services. These services, including Visa Advanced Authorization, provide preventive, monitoring, investigative and predictive tools, which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level. Issuer Processing Services. Visa Debit Processing Services, or DPS, provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating U.S. issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment  products. In addition to core issuer authorization processing, DPS offers card management services, exception processing, PIN and ATM network gateways, call center services, fraud detection services and ATM terminal driving. Visa Processing Service, or VPS, provides credit, debit and prepaid issuer processing services, including multi-currency processing functionality, outside the United States. Loyalty Services . We offer loyalty services, which allow our clients to differentiate their Visa program offerings, enhance the attractiveness of their Visa payment programs and strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants. Dispute Management Services . We manage Visa Resolve Online, an automated web-based service that allows our clients back-office analysts and client service representatives to manage and resolve Visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with paper-based processes. Value-Added Information Services . We provide our clients with a range of additional information-based business analytics and applications, as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them. CyberSource-branded services . We provide technology and services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud, and safeguard payment security online. CyberSource brings these payment management solutions to market on two platforms: CyberSource Enterprise services, targeting medium and large-sized enterprise businesses; and Authorize.Net, targeting smaller businesses with less than $3 million in annual online sales. Product Platforms We offer a broad range of product platforms that enable our clients to build differentiated, competitive payment programs for their consumer, business, government and merchant clients. Our principal payment platforms enable credit, charge, deferred debit, debit and prepaid payments, as well as cash access for consumers, businesses and government entities. Our payment platforms are offered under our Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Consumer Credit Our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments. Our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as Visa Classic. In addition, we offer a range of premium credit platforms that enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits, such as loyalty programs. Our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers, and in some cases, to cardholders, as Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Signature Preferred and Visa Infinite. Consumer Deposit Access Our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw on consumers deposit accounts, such as checking, demand deposit or other pre-funded accounts. Consumer Debit . Our primary consumer debit platform in the United States and many other countries uses the Visa brand mark. Depending on local marketplace point of sale practices, there are a variety of cardholder verification methods to suit specific merchant segments or acceptance channels, while ensuring a valid and secure transaction. Visa Debit transactions can be authenticated  by a cardholders signature, a PIN, no signature if the transaction is for a small purchase amount, or another means of authentication. In the United States, in addition to the Visa debit product, we also provide the Interlink debit product platform. Interlink is a PIN-always, single-message platform generally for U.S. domestic transactions. U.S. issuers can choose to enable Interlink on a Visa debit card, and U.S. merchants can choose Interlink as a PIN-always point of sale acceptance option. Additionally, Interlink can remain as a routing alternative on both Visa and non-Visa-branded debit cards. Our clients in Asia Pacific, or AP, Latin America and Caribbean, or LAC, and Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or CEMEA, can use the Visa Electron debit platform, which requires all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically. It is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher-risk client segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less prevalent. Prepaid. Our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a pre-funded account, allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. Our prepaid platform includes general purpose reloadable, gift, travel, youth, payroll, money transfer, corporate incentive, insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards. Cash Access. Our clients can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at Visa and PLUS branded ATMs. Most Visa and Visa Electron branded cards offer cash access at ATMs, as well as at branches of our participating financial institution clients. The PLUS brand may also be included on issuers non-Visa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services. Commercial Our commercial product platforms enable small businesses, medium and large companies, and government organizations to streamline payment processes, manage total spend, access information reporting, automate their supply chain and reduce administrative costs. Small Businesses . The Visa Business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools, purchasing savings, rewards and management reporting. Visa Business Electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside North America. Large and Medium Companies. The Visa Corporate platform offers payment options primarily for employee travel and entertainment charges, including cash advances, and provides detailed transaction data as well as information and expense management tools. The Visa Purchasing platform provides card and non-card electronic payment products that allow companies to easily procure goods and services, while streamlining resource- and paper-intensive purchase order and invoice processing. Through Syncada, our joint venture with US Bank, we market an integrated invoice processing, payment and financing platform for financial institutions to offer to their corporate and government commercial clients around the world. Government Organizations. In addition to the products mentioned above, we offer government organizations unique information- and expense-management tools, employee-fraud- and misuse-management tools and strategic sourcing tools for their card programs. In certain countries, we offer specialized commercial products for specific government-sponsored programs, typically targeting agriculture, small-business, freight or construction loan programs. Product Platform Innovation Our fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms, enabling more Visa transactions in every channel, and extending the utility of our products and services to access points, such as eCommerce and mobile, and new merchant segments and geographies.  We invest in innovation, because we believe we can drive more secure, accessible and versatile payment program options for clients, merchants and consumers. We focus on new payment channels, payment technologies, payment account access devices and authentication methods, and have recently made significant investments in the development of eCommerce and mobile payment platforms; contact and contactless chip cards and devices; card product enhancements; authentication and security technologies and platforms; and money transfer. We announced the following developments: ##TABLE_START    Fundamo: We acquired Fundamo, a leading provider of mobile financial services. This will enable Visa to offer a full range of mobile financial services to unbanked and under-banked consumers in developing countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Monitise: We executed a five-year commercial agreement with Monitise, which operates payments and mobile banking services for some of the worlds leading financial institutions. This allows Visa to mobilize existing Visa accounts and offer, in partnership with financial institutions, a suite of mobile financial services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    PlaySpan: We acquired PlaySpan, a privately held company whose payments platform handles transactions for digital goods in online games, digital media and social networks around the world. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Visa Digital Wallet: We announced Visas digital wallet, which will provide a simpler and secure way for consumers to click to buy eCommerce and mCommerce purchases. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Mobile Partnerships: We have licensed our mobile NFC payment technology, Visa payWave, to Google and Isis to ensure third-party mobile wallets are enabled with Visa payment functionality. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Real Time Messaging for Merchants: We launched a Real Time Messaging, or RTM, platform to deliver, in partnership with merchants, real-time, location-based and relevant merchant discounts and promotions to consumers who opt in to the service. ##TABLE_END Payments Network Management We devote significant resources to ensure that Visa is the payments network of choice for clients, merchants and cardholders. We seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities, educating domestic and regulatory banking authorities on our capabilities, increasing issuance and acceptance of Visa products around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants. Brand Management and Promotion, and Corporate Reputation We engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, taking a targeted, analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives. We combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, public relations and, increasingly, social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand, promote product usage, increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention. For merchants, we work to ensure that the Visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment, as well as a way to increase sales. For our issuer clients, our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. We establish global marketing relationships to promote the Visa brand and to allow clients to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events. For instance, we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor for the Olympic Games since 1986 and  have extended the sponsorship through 2020. We are also one of six FIFA partners, which provides us with worldwide exclusive access to the FIFA World Cup and more than 40 other FIFA competitions through 2014. This sponsorship creates a powerful opportunity to drive business, achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift, global reach and local relevance. In addition, we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional, national and local companies, sports leagues or events, such as the National Football League in the United States, or with associations and companies, to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions. Our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments. These programs, which we develop in conjunction with merchants, generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions. In addition, we work on various fronts to maintain, enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand. Our Corporate Responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities. We do so by promoting financial literacy and inclusion, providing humanitarian aid and community support, and engaging in responsible business practices. We continue to promote an understanding of Visas role as a payments network and articulate the ways that digital currency can advance economic empowerment and business efficiencies. To that end, Currency of Progress, our corporate reputation campaign launched in October 2009, communicates the tangible benefits that Visa and digital currency delivers to individuals, businesses, governments and economies. Merchant Acceptance Initiatives We aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fast-growing segments, such as bill payment. Our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations, delivering value-added information services, and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment. For example, in October 2010 we began offering a global program that enables millions of face-to-face merchants to accept Visa cards for transactions of approximately $25 or less without requiring a cardholder signature, PIN or providing a receipt, unless requested by the cardholder. This program can increase speed at the point of sale, enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants. We also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our products. Client Standards Rulemaking and Enforcement. In general, our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems. Our clients are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with, and in certain cases non-equity membership interests in, our subsidiaries. These rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks; the standards, design and features of payment cards, devices and programs; processing; merchant acquiring activities, including use of agents; disputes between members; risk management; guaranteed settlement; client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients. We establish dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions. For example, after a transaction is presented to an issuer, the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons, including fraud. If the issuer believes there is a defect in a  transaction, the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer, an action termed a chargeback. We enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes. Credit Risk Management. We indemnify our clients for any settlement loss suffered due to another clients failure to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. We have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years. To manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations, we established a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures. We regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk. In certain instances, we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees. If a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss. We may also apply other risk control measures, such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions, limiting the use of certain types of agents, prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high-risk merchants or suspending or terminating a clients rights to participate in our payments network. The exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model, which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). See Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management elsewhere in this report. Payment System Integrity The integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products. Fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or card-not-present transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems not associated with VisaNet that store cardholder or account data, including systems operated by merchants, financial institutions and other third-party data processors. Our fraud detection and prevention offerings include: ##TABLE_START    Verified by Visa, a global Internet authentication product, which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Visa Advanced Authorization, which provides enhanced fraud detection capability by adding real-time risk scores to authorization messages; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Chip technologies, embedded microprocessors that provide enhanced security, which reduce the incidence of counterfeit card fraud. As a result, Visa has created incentives for merchants and issuers to adopt them, including in the United States. Chip technologies can also carry other applications that enhance the consumer payment experience; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    CyberSources globally proven Decision Manager solution, which provides access to over 200 validation tests to assess the legitimacy of card-not-present orders. ##TABLE_END We work with all participants in the payment system to ensure that any entity that transmits, processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders. For example, we mandate protection of PIN data through use of the Triple Data Encryption Standard and work with the payments industry to manage the Payment Card Industry Data  Security Standards (PCI DSS). There has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of PCI DSS, with more than 97% percent of the largest U.S. merchants validating compliance annually. Government Regulation General . Government regulation affects key aspects of our business. Our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and consequently such regulations have the potential to affect our business indirectly. In recent years, our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. See Item 1ARisk FactorsIncreased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues. The Reform Act . As noted, during the 2011 fiscal year, the U.S. Federal Reserve established new rules under the Reform Act affecting interchange reimbursement fees, network exclusivity and transaction routing. We expect these rules to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process and decrease associated revenues. See Item 1  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview and Item 1A  Risk Factors  The Reform Act may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . We have significantly modified our debit strategy as a result. See  Overview . Interchange Reimbursement Fees. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the United States and many other geographies. The new rules under the Reform Act set the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounts to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. See Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Reform Act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business; Item 1ARisk FactorsIncreasing regulation of interchange reimbursement fees and other business practices may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business, and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 21Legal Matters elsewhere in this report. The United States is not the only jurisdiction to regulate interchange reimbursement fees. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia has enacted a regulation limiting the costs that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fees for both our credit and our debit cards. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated from products in our payments system. We generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value. They promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other. By establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands, we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic  transactions and to maximize participation in the Visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and, ultimately, consumers and merchants. We believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers, merchants, our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment, and by creating incentives for innovation, enhanced data quality and security. Merchants do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fees. A merchants cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate. The merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in open-loop payments networks, including those relating to interchange, and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants. Merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers, other payment card systems and other forms of payment. We do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers. Network Exclusivity and Routing. We have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, issuers of some debit products choose to include only the Visa network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, Visas rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through VisaNet and that a member must clear international transactions through VisaNet. Issues relating to network exclusivity and the routing of transactions over VisaNet are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used. Most notably, the new rules under the Reform Act limit our and issuers ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. The rules require issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. As another example, the Canadian Ministry of Finance has implemented a voluntary Code of Conduct for payment card industry participants, with which Visa has agreed to comply. Among other things, the Code of Conduct prohibits certain restrictions on merchants choice of payment options they will accept. See Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Reform Act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business and Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or denying them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Reform Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The bureaus future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating the industry. No-Surcharge Rules. We have historically implemented policies that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa instead of other means. Several jurisdictions have expressed an interest in putting an end to these no-surcharge rules. Most recently, the Reserve  Bank of Australia has enacted a regulation stopping us from prohibiting merchants from imposing surcharges on customers who use Visa, affecting the manner in which we conduct our business there. Data Protection and Information Security. We devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with U.S. federal and state and foreign regulations safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institution Examination Council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the United States to ensure our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctioned Countries. In response to U.S. and other regulations, we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine a program to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. We also prohibit from being Visa members all financial institutions that are domiciled in countries sanctioned by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Controlcurrently Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, Syria and Sudan. In addition, we refrain from any financial dealings with restricted third parties, such as identified money-laundering fronts for terrorists and narcotics traffickers. Government-Imposed Market Participation Restrictions. Our businesss reach remains limited by certain countries protection of domestic payment card providers or payment processing providers. Most notably, our financial institution clients in China may not issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in China, limiting our opportunities in that market. Regulators in Australia, Mexico, Colombia, India, Singapore, Russia and Malaysia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries. Regulation of Internet Transactions . Many jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulations and taxes on internet transactions. Most notably, we have had to implement compliance programs in response to new U.S. regulations requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions. In addition, the U.S. Congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our clients. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would affect our clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our clients ability to extend credit by using payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We own a number of valuable trademarks and designs, which are essential to our business, including, but not limited to  Visa, Interlink, PLUS, Visa Electron, the Winged V design, the Dove design and the Bands Design-Blue, White  Gold. We also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands, products, programs and services. Through agreements with our clients, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment, including paper-based forms, principally cash and checks; card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited-use cards; and other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automatic clearing house, or ACH, payments and electronic data interchange. Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants. The leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club. Other general-purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. In certain countries, our competitors have leading positions, such as China UnionPay in China, which is the sole domestic inter-bank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in China due to local regulation. We also compete against private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other merchant. In the debit card market segment, Visa and MasterCard are the primary global brands. In addition, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands including STAR, NYCE, and PULSE in the United States, EFTPOS in Australia and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the online debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands are the primary brands, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume. We increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional bank-centric business model. The emergence of these competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal is one example. It competes with Visa directly in some cases, yet PayPal also is one of Visas largest global eCommerce merchants.  Based on payments volume, total volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general-purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2010: ##TABLE_START Company  Payments Volume   Total Volume   Total Transactions   Cards    (billions)   (billions)   (billions)   (millions)  Visa Inc.

Working Capital Requirements Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients generally represents our most consistent and substantial working capital requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution clients with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. We maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement. During fiscal 2011, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $130 million, with the highest daily balance being $401 million. Seasonality We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 accounted for more than 30% of our fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 operating revenues.  Employees At September 30, 2011, we employed approximately 7,500 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Additional Information and SEC Reports Visa Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to our reorganization, Visa operated as five corporate entities related by ownership and membership, each of which operated as a separate geographic region. As a result of the reorganization, all except Visa Europe became subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. in connection with the reorganization. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, in March 2008.

Risk Factors ##TABLE_END Regulatory Risks Increasing regulation of interchange reimbursement fees and other business practices may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours. In connection with transactions initiated with products in our payments system, interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers: the financial institutions that issue Visa cards to cardholders. The fees are typically paid by acquirers: the financial institutions that offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants. We refer to a system like ours, in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer, as an open-loop system. We generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees could substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the United States and many other geographies. However, in certain jurisdictions, interchange rates and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation. The Reform Act has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area in the United States. See The Reform Act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . In addition, interchange rates have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates. These jurisdictions include Australia, Canada, Brazil and South Africa. If we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system unattractive. This could materially lower overall transaction volume or slow growth of  transactions in the future. It could also materially increase the attractiveness of closed-loop payments systems-those with direct connections to both merchants and consumers-and other forms of payment. In addition, issuers could begin to charge new or higher fees to consumers. This could make our card programs less desirable and reduce our transaction volumes and profitability. Acquirers could elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the level of Visa interchange, leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer Visa cardholders to alternate payment systems. In addition, issuers and acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge. Any of the foregoing could have a substantial, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or denying them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. In order to ensure our cardholders have a consistent experience, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some debit products choose to include only the Visa network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, Visas rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through VisaNet and that a member must clear international transactions through VisaNet. The Reform Act already limits our and issuers ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See The Reform Act may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . These restrictions and future regulations like them in the United States and elsewhere could cause a material decrease in the number of transactions we process. In order to retain that transaction volume, we might have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers, or we might have to increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants. Any of these eventualities could have a material, adverse affect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The Reform Act may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. We expect these regulations to adversely affect our U.S. debit business and associated revenues. They will likely create negative pressure on our pricing, reduce the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminish associated revenues.  These pressures will likely arise through various channels. A number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. We expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. Because we may have to re-examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations, these and other clients will have the opportunity to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards. The Reform Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The bureaus future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit, and prepaid. Some elements of the Reform Act are vague or lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the regulation. Our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategies less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, these regulations and developments arising from the Reform Act could have a material, adverse affect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. New regulations or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products. Regulators around the world increasingly note each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Reform Act is one notable such development. Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product. For example, regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit. As a result, the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment. These include matters like interchange reimbursement fees, network exclusivity, operating regulations and preferred routing agreements. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our products, services, fees and other important aspects of our business. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues. Governments in some countries provide resources or protection to selected domestic payment card networks, brands and processing providers. These governments may take this action in order to support these providers. They may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries, to  force us to leave, or to restrict substantially our activities there. For example, the government of China, a significant emerging market, has increasingly tightened its rules requiring use of a domestic network. Additionally, governments in some countries may consider, regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country. This would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients. Our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands. Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued, our payments volume and our revenues. Recently, privacy, data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States (at the federal and state level) and in other countries. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach. These measures may materially increase our costs and our clients costs. They may also decrease the number of our cards our clients issue. This would materially and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, our failure, or the failure of our clients, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. Increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues. Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. Complying with these and other regulations may increase our costs or reduce our revenue opportunities. Similarly, the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations could limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations. Examples include: ##TABLE_START    Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Anti-Money-Laundering , Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions. The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions require us to maint a in an anti-money laundering program. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, restrict us from dealing with certain countries and parties considered to be connected with money laundering, terrorism or narcotics. Non-U.S. Visa International members may not be similarly restricted, so in some cases our payments system may be used for transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions, potentially subjecting us to penalties, reputational damage or loss of business. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of the Price of Credit. Many jurisdictions in which our cards are used have new or proposed regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuers to charge interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act and proposed regulations under it. They also include proposed changes to the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which, if implemented along with regulations required to be ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  promulgated under the Credit CARD Act, could result in a decrease in our payments volume and revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increased Central Bank Oversight. Several central banks around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the retail electronic payments industry, in some cases designating them as systemically important payment systems. Such oversight may lead to additional regulations. These could include new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Safety and Soundness Regulation. Recent federal banking regulations may make some financial institutions less attracted to becoming an issuer of our cards, because they may be subject to more conservative accounting procedures, increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Regulation of Internet Transactions. Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using our cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the law that governs them, their taxation and the allocation of intellectual property rights. ##TABLE_END Litigation Risks Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments. Our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation, which is described in Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offerings), a loss-sharing agreement and a judgment-sharing agreement. In addition, our U.S. members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated, and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or, in certain circumstances, even cause us to become insolvent. The principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fees. Since 2005, approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain financial institutions that issue Visa-branded payment cards and acquire Visa-branded payment transactions in the U.S. We refer to this as the interchange litigation. Among other antitrust allegations, the plaintiffs allege that Visas setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages will be trebled. The allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report.  The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan. Failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows and could even cause us to become insolvent. Even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our monetary liabilities, settlements or judgments in the interchange litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, settlements or judgments in the interchange litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. The retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation. The plan does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre-trial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation. In addition, our retrospective responsibility plan covers only the potential monetary liability from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation. Non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future. This could adversely affect our revenues, increase our expenses and/or limit our prospects for growth. Therefore, even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our monetary obligations with respect to settlements of, and judgments in, the covered litigation, it may not insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of them. If we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, which may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition/antitrust law, consumer protection law, or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. Private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us. This is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers, due to the size and scope of our business. If we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit, such as the United States or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be significant. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages. We may also have to change our business practices, including by limiting interchange reimbursement fees and by revising our rules about fees charged to consumers who choose to pay with Visa. This could limit our payments volume and result in a material and adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, cash flow, financial conditions, prospects for future growth and overall business and could even cause us to become insolvent. Limitations on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. For example, in October 2010, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ,  and a number of state attorneys general relating to their investigation of certain Visa merchant acceptance practices. In accordance with the resulting consent decree, Visa will allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer cardholders to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to any card product, such as a non-reward Visa credit card. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The settlement does not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange, and does not preclude the DOJ from pursuing a future investigation of these or other topics. This settlement and other limitations on our business that were the result of settlements of, or judgments in, litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws applicable to us, could materially increase our tax payments. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 20Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report. Our agreement with Visa Europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities. Under our framework agreement with Visa Europe, we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we, nor any of our related parties or agents, participated in the actions giving rise to such claims. Such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. Business Risks The intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. We offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand our card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing support payments and other support. Over the past several years, we have increased the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the United States. In order to stay competitive, we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Reform Act have increased this pressure. See The U.S. Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material adverse impact on our  revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business. This pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable, or unprofitable, and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability. Pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks, presenting the potential for the same adverse effects. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. Finally, increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, and we may not succeed in these efforts. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of intense competition in our industry. The global payments industry is intensely competitive. Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks and electronic transactions, such as wire transfers and automatic clearinghouse payments. In addition, our payment programs compete against the card-based payments systems of our competitors and private-label cards issued by merchants. The Reform Act has increased this competitive pressure. Some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. They may offer a wider range of programs and services than we do. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do. They may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have. They may also introduce more innovative programs and services than we provide. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. These include domestic networks in the United States, China, Canada, Australia, and other countries and regions. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. Traditional or non-traditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients long-term commitments to our products has increased with the Reform Acts restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. Most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive. These include those with our largest clients: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships, sometimes on relatively short notice, and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 14Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this report.  We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START    Competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Competition may increase from alternative types of payment services, such as mobile payments services, online payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business. Our position in the payments value chain underpins our business. Certain of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternative payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. The Reform Act has provided them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although they pursue the same or similar lines of business using the same or similar business and commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients, materially and adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. The banking industry has recently undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation, which could continue. Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors. This could result in the acquired banks Visa business shifting to that competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. In addition, one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors, shifting its payments volume to that competitor. Any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients. This consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us. In addition, consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify  for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. In addition, the current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. Merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation, regulation, regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements. We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants are seeking to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation. If they continue, these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. We, as well as our clients, negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants. This could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives. Certain financial institutions have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues. Certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues. In addition, these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Failure to maintain relationships with our clients, merchant acquirers, merchants and third-party vendors, and the failure of clients to provide services on our behalf, could materially and adversely affect our business. We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services. We do not have direct relationships with cardholders. We do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates, if any, or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features. As a result, the success of our business has depended significantly on, and will continue to depend on, the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them. Historically, we have not solicited merchants to accept our cards. In the wake of the Reform Acts changes to rules on network exclusivity, we expect to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants and merchant acquirers. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with the merchant, who directly receives incentive funding. We also engage in some amount of merchant acceptance activity. As these and other relationships take on a greater importance for both  merchants and us, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In many countries outside the United States, our clients or other processors authorize, clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems. This pattern is increasing with a rise in new systems endorsed by governments. Our inability to control the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf, and to the extent that third-party vendors fail to deliver services, our business and reputation could be impaired. The perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation, which are key assets of our business. Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry. Our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands. From time to time, our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge, which may materially and adversely affect our business. Further, Visa Europe has very broad latitude to operate the Visa business in and use our brands and technology within Visa Europes region, in which we have only limited control over the operation of the Visa business. Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the Visa brands in its region, and the strength of the Visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of Visa Europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in Europe. Finally, adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny. Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. Unprecedented economic events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world. These include decreased consumer spending, increased unemployment, deflation, increased savings, decreased consumer debt, excess housing inventory, lowered government spending, decreased export activity, continued challenges in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility, additional government intervention, bank instability, downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt, political issues affecting the handling of national debt, and the uncertainty arising from new government policies. This economic turmoil has affected the economies of the United States and other mature economies in particular. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise. These could include, among other things, policy missteps, exhaustion of U.S. and other national economic stimulus packages, defaults on government debt in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, economic turmoil in China, the euro zone or Japan, or a significant decline in the commercial real estate market. Most recently, the economic situation in Europe has been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of a default by Greece, and potentially other nations, on their debt obligations, If such a default occurs, or if the measures taken to avert such a default create their own instability, the impact is likely to be global and highly significant.  Some existing clients have been placed in receivership or under government administration. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential changes in laws and regulations. Many of our clients, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected. Our financial results may be negatively affected by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis. The severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present. As a result, our revenue growth has been and may continue to be negatively affected, or we may be affected, in several ways, including but not limited to the following: ##TABLE_START    Depressed consumer and business confidence may decrease cardholder spending. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or additional expense reductions, which may reduce our revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, affecting our revenue and reducing cardholders desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may increase cardholder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, which could decrease our value proposition to consumers, thereby reducing consumers desire to use our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business with those institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The trading markets for U.S. government securities may be adversely affected by changes in investor sentiment. This could arise from a number of market forces, including, among others, the U.S. governments inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in its debt rating. This in turn could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are U.S. treasury and government securities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage matters. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies. ##TABLE_END Finally, the stock markets have recently demonstrated extreme volatility. Additional declines in stock prices or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, growth, revenue, profitability and overall business.  A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions. We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions. Our clients pay us fees in connection with cross-border transactions. Some of those fees may differ if conversion from the merchants currency to the cardholders billing currency is required. Thus, revenue from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuates with cross-border travel and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency. Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, natural disasters, the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases. A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. A decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Moreover, if our clients decide to increase cardholder fees associated with cross-border transactions, there could be a decline in cardholder spending, since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients settlement in different currencies. A reduction in, or other changes to, multi-currency transactions could decrease the need for or otherwise affect foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as result of regulation, litigation, competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. Transactions outside the United States represent an increasingly important part of our strategy. If we do not maintain consistency in the types of products we provide, the quality of our service and the viability of our brand, we will be unable to continue to grow in those areas. Finally, because we are domiciled in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations we have guaranteed. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources, as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions. Some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with  our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and, potentially, our results of operations. If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently, the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism, climate change or accident. Our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computer-based attacks, leading to an interruption in service, increased costs or the compromise of data security. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Although we maintain a business continuity program and an information security program to address these risks, we cannot be sure that they will be effective. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services, the use of our cards could decline, reducing our revenues and net income. Rapid, significant technological changes are confronting the payments industry. These include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mCommerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our card products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties intellectual property rights. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. Account data breaches involving card data stored, processed or transmitted could adversely affect our reputation and revenues. Our clients, merchants, others and we store, process and transmit cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. Breach of the systems storing, processing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, to reputational damage and to claims against us. If we are sued in connection with any material data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  profitability. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards, which could have a material adverse effect on our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, any data security breach could result in additional regulation, which could materially increase our costs. An increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information. They use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards. A rise in fraud levels involving our cards, or in misconduct by third parties processing transactions using our cards, could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs. Failure to maintain interoperability between Visa Inc.s and Visa Europes authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands. Before our reorganization in October 2007, Visa Europe and we shared authorization, clearing, and settlement systems. Visa Europe completed and substantially deployed its own systems in the 2010 fiscal year. As a result, Visa Europe and we will have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europes newly independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems as they diverge over time. Failure to authorize or clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the Visa brands. Risks Related to our Structure and Organization We have little ability to control Visa Europes operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us. Visa Europe has very broad rights to operate the Visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship. If we want to change a global rule or require Visa Europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for Visa Europe and its members, then Visa Europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that Visa Europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation. If Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations, our remedies under this agreement are limited. We cannot terminate the agreement even upon Visa Europes material, uncured breach. Although we have a call right to acquire Visa Europe, we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances. These and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder. In some instances, as in the case of CyberSource and PlaySpan, Visa Europe may have the right to control the activities of newly acquired entities within Visa Europes territory. In any event, Visa  Europes exclusive license rights in Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from Visa Europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in Visa Europes region. If Visa Europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock, we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income. We have granted Visa Europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised. We will incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more if Visa Europe exercises this option. Visa Europe may do so at any time. We may need to obtain third-party financing in order to meet our obligation, by either borrowing funds or selling stock. An equity offering, or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock, would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price. Sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. If Visa Europe exercises the put option, we may encounter difficulties in integrating Visa Europes business and systems into our existing operations. If we cannot do so quickly and cost-effectively, the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management, disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we would become subject to the many regulations of the European Union that govern the operations of Visa Europe, including any regulatory disputes. We are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option. We record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations. Consequently, the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share. These quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant. The existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it. If we cannot remain organizationally effective, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive, economic and regulatory environment. Since our reorganization in October 2007, we have increasingly centralized our management and operations. For us to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization, and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, the current competitive, economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges. We may not be able to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough, define our appetite for risk specifically enough, execute our strategy seamlessly enough, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes efficiently enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough. We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees. Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in  inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business. Our chief executive officers contract terminates in March 2013, and we cannot assure that there will be an effective transition to a new CEO when necessary. Acquisitions, strategic investments and entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. The integration of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, all acquired recently, will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions. We will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the Visa Europe territory. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues. Moreover, our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments. With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisition or through organic development. Relative inexperience in such businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the expiration or waiver of transfer restrictions on our class B stock, could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class A common stock, adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class A common stock. The market price and voting power of our class A common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding. The market price of our class A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur, such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class A common stock. Specifically, upon the final resolution of our covered litigation, all class B stock will become transferable at once. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted. Under our retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class B common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class A common stock, benefitting the holders of class B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest in Visa Inc. held by the holders of class A common stock. In this case, the amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution.  Holders of our shares of our class B and C common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions, and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class A common stock. Although their voting rights are limited, holders of shares of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control. Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock, shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5% of our total outstanding shares on an as-converted basis. Our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows. Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. Any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. However, sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends. Payment of future dividends, if any, would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If, because of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the year ended September 30, 2011, reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. The Reform Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. We expect the interchange and exclusivity regulations, as well as the routing regulations, to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process, and decrease associated revenues. A number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. We expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year, and the pace of our U.S. revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Because we may have to re-examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations, these and other clients will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards. We believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act to some extent through pricing modifications, and working with our clients and other business partners to win  merchant preference to route transactions over our network. Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impacts of the Reform Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Reform Act while mitigating some of the negative impacts the Reform Act would have on our current business models. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. Share repurchases. We effectively repurchased 43.0 million shares at an average price of $74.94 per share, for a total cost of $3.2 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011. Of the $3.2 billion, $2.0 billion was executed through the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market, and $1.2 billion was effectively executed through deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. Adjusted Financial Results . During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a decrease of $122 million and $79 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. The following table presents our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2011 and 2010 excluding the impact of this revaluation. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011   Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010    (in millions, except per share data)  Net income attributable to Visa Inc. (as reported)  $ 3,650   $ 2,966  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option   (122 )   (79 )     Adjusted net income attributable to Visa Inc.  $ 3,528   $ 2,887  Weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding (as reported)   707    739  Adjusted diluted earnings per share  $ 4.99   $ 3.91  Diluted earnings per share (as reported)  $ 5.16   $ 4.01  Impact of the revaluation of Visa Europe put option  $ 0.17   $ 0.10  ##TABLE_END We believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period. The reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year was primarily the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. We therefore believe that the resulting non-operating income recorded is not indicative of Visas performance in these years or future periods. Fundamo acquisition . On June 9, 2011, we acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies, for $110 million. The acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of Visas global strategy to provide the next generation of payments solutions and to provide long-term growth opportunities to connect unbanked or under-banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.02 for the full 2011 fiscal year. See Note 5Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. PlaySpan acquisition. On March 1, 2011, we acquired PlaySpan, a privately held company whose payments platform processes transactions for digital goods in online games, digital media and social  networks around the world, for total potential purchase consideration of up to $225 million. The acquisition of PlaySpan extends Visas capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce in order to expand the scope of payment services available to clients and consumers. See Note 5Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.03 for the full 2011 fiscal year. Sale of investment in Companhia Brasileira de Solues e Servios (CBSS). On January 24, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Visa International, sold its 10 percent stake in Visa Vale issuer CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Banco Bradesco. CBSS continues to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil, and Visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction. Visas gross proceeds from the sale were $103 million. After receiving regulatory approval during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $85 million in the investment income, net line on our consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $44 million. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. We have maintained double digit growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions for the past two years. The increase in payments volume and processed transactions reflects the continuing worldwide shift to digital currency. The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars (1) . ##TABLE_START   U.S.   Rest of World   Visa Inc.    12 months ended June 30, 2011 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2011 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2011 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   % Change    (in billions, except percentages)  Nominal Payments Volume          Consumer credit  $ 641   $ 599    7 %  $ 1,188   $ 987    20 %  $ 1,829   $ 1,586    15 % Consumer debit (2)   1,037    909    14 %   265    197    34 %   1,302    1,107    18 % Commercial and other (2)   282    243    16 %   116    100    15 %   398    344    16 %                Total Nominal Payments Volume  $ 1,961   $ 1,752    12 %  $ 1,569   $ 1,285    22 %  $ 3,530   $ 3,037    16 % Cash volume   404    374    8 %   1,704    1,411    21 %   2,108    1,785    18 %                Total Nominal Volume (3)  $ 2,364   $ 2,125    11 %  $ 3,273   $ 2,696    21 %  $ 5,638   $ 4,821    17 %                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   U.S.   Rest of World   Visa Inc.    12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2009 (4)   % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2009 (4)   % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2010 (4)   12 months ended June 30, 2009 (4)   % Change    (in billions, except percentages)  Nominal Payments Volume          Consumer credit  $ 599   $ 613    (2 )%  $ 987   $ 811    22 %  $ 1,586   $ 1,424    11 % Consumer debit (2)   909    787    16 %   197    148    33 %   1,107    935    18 % Commercial and other (2)   243    221    10 %   100    99    1 %   344    320    7 %                Total Nominal Payments Volume  $ 1,752   $ 1,621    8 %  $ 1,285   $ 1,058    21 %  $ 3,037   $ 2,679    13 % Cash volume   374    380    (2 )%   1,411    1,189    19 %   1,785    1,569    14 %                Total Nominal Volume (3)  $ 2,125   $ 2,001    6 %  $ 2,696   $ 2,248    20 %  $ 4,821   $ 4,248    13 %                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Figures may not sum due to rounding.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are primarily earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues include revenues earned for transactions processed by VisaNet, our secure, centralized global processing platform, CyberSources online payment gateway and PlaySpans virtual goods payment platform.  International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume and currency conversion activities. Cross-border volumes involve transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country and includes both single and multi-currency transactions. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and activities related to our recently acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of acquired in technology and other assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, obtained in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource, March 2011 acquisition of PlaySpan and June 2011 acquisition of Fundamo. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other cost method investments.  Other non-operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2011   2010   2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009    (in millions, except percentages)  U.S.  $ 5,135   $ 4,718   $ 4,023   $ 417   $ 695    9 %   17 % Rest of world   3,846    3,137    2,669    709    468    23 %   18 % Visa Europe   207    210    219    (3 )   (9 )   (1 )%   (4 )%             Total Operating Revenues  $ 9,188   $ 8,065   $ 6,911   $ 1,123   $ 1,154    14 %   17 %             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued double digit growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border payments volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services, as well as the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entities. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to client incentives as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Reform Act. The new U.S. debit regulations will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the U.S., primarily within service and data processing revenues, through fiscal 2012. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year. We further expect that the pace of our U.S. revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 2% and 1% increase, respectively, in total operating revenues compared to the same prior year periods. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. We do not expect a significant impact from currency fluctuations during the 2012 fiscal year, as the effect of exchange rate movements is minimized through our hedging program.  The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2011   2010   2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009    (in millions, except percentages)  Service revenues  $ 4,261   $ 3,497   $ 3,174   $ 764   $ 323    22 %   10 % Data processing revenues   3,478    3,125    2,430    353    695    11 %   29 % International transaction revenues   2,674    2,290    1,916    384    374    17 %   20 % Other revenues   655    713    625    (58 )   88    (8 )%   14 % Client incentives   (1,880 )   (1,560 )   (1,234 )   (320 )   (326 )   21 %   26 %             Total Operating Revenues  $ 9,188   $ 8,065   $ 6,911   $ 1,123   $ 1,154    14 %   17 %             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues also benefited from competitive pricing actions which became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as we align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. ##TABLE_END Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_START    Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% of growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource, which we acquired in July 2010. As anticipated, this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and a previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions. Beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year, associated with the pass-through of non-Visa network transactions, did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. ##TABLE_END Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Fiscal 2010 data processing revenues also benefited slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. ##TABLE_START    International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting growth of 18% in nominal cross-border payments volume. ##TABLE_END International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross-border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_START    Other revenues decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third-party service provider. As a result, revenues and ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decrease was partially offset by increases in licensing fees and the inclusion of revenue attributable to CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. ##TABLE_END Other revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. The increase also reflected growth in other license and royalty fees. ##TABLE_START    Client incentives increased in fiscal 2011 reflecting growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011. Beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the new U.S. debit regulations triggered renegotiations with some of our existing issuing clients and resulted in new contracts with dozens of merchants and some acquirers to win transaction routing preference. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to initiate or renew contracts with merchants and acquirers, which will likely impact our fiscal 2012 results. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17% to 18% for the full 2012 fiscal year. The actual amount of client incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_END Client incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one-time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2011   2010   2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009    (in millions, except percentages)  Personnel  $ 1,459   $ 1,222   $ 1,228   $ 237   $ (6 )   19 %   (1 )% Network and processing   357    425    393    (68 )   32    (16 )%   8 % Marketing   870    964    918    (94 )   46    (10 )%   5 % Professional fees   337    286    268    51    18    18 %   7 % Depreciation and amortization   288    265    226    23    39    9 %   17 % General and administrative   414    359    338    55    21    15 %   7 % Litigation provision   7    (45 )   2    52    (47 )   NM    NM              Total Operating Expenses  $ 3,732   $ 3,476   $ 3,373   $ 256   $ 103    7 %   3 %             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Personnel increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo in July 2010, March 2011 and June ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  2011, respectively. These acquisitions, combined with other increases in headcount throughout the organization, reflect our strategy to invest for future growth. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2010 reflects lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements . The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. ##TABLE_START    Network and processing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions. Beginning October 2010, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with the pass-through of non-Visa network transactions did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset; however, this change in presentation resulted in a reported decline in network and processing throughout fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. ##TABLE_START    Marketing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third-party service provider. As a result, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2012, which is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions, as well as some modest incremental spend associated with our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. ##TABLE_START    Professional fees increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting investment in technology projects to support our strategy for future growth, ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_START    Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition, as well as charges related to the east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. ##TABLE_START    General and administrative increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2010, general and administration expenses increased primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. ##TABLE_START    Litigation provision increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the absence of the $41 million pre-tax gain recorded in fiscal 2010 as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. There were no other significant litigation provisions made during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year ended September 30,   $ Change   % Change (1)    2011   2010   2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009   2011 vs. 2010   2010 vs. 2009    (in millions, except percentages)  Interest expense  $ (32 )  $ (72 )  $ (115 )  $ 40   $ 43    (55 )%   (37 )% Investment income, net   108    49    575    59    (526 )   NM    (92 )% Other   124    72    2    52    70    73 %   NM              Total Other Income (Expense)  $ 200   $ 49   $ 462   $ 151   $ (413 )   NM    (90 )%             ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the reversal of prior years accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. The decrease in fiscal 2011 also reflects lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. See Note 20Income Taxes and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Investment income, net increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the pre-tax gains recognized from our sale of Visa Vale issuer CBSS, partially offset by the absence of the pre-tax gain recognized in fiscal 2010 for our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. ##TABLE_END Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre-tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our investments and lower investment balances.  ##TABLE_START    Other non-operating income primarily reflects non-cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rates were 36% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., beneficial changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010, and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. As a result of anticipated beneficial changes to certain state tax laws beginning in fiscal 2012 and other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2012 to 33% to 34%. This rate excludes any potential related non-cash impact from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010   2009    (in millions)  Total cash provided by (used in):    Operating activities  $ 3,872    2,691    558  Investing activities   (2,299 )   (1,904 )   1,830  Financing activities   (3,304 )   (1,542 )   (2,751 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   (9 )   5    1        Decrease in cash and cash equivalents  $ (1,740 )  $ (750 )  $ (362 )       ##TABLE_END  Operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year-to-date net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation in the prior year. Both periods also contain other significant operational payments, including those related to client incentives, settlement transactions, other litigation settlement payments and our annual incentive compensation payments, which were broadly consistent year over year. Although we expect the new U.S. debit regulations to moderate the pace of our growth in operating cash in fiscal 2012, we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income, including non-controlling interest, of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for client incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher net income and lower litigation settlement payments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income, including non-controlling interest, of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non-cash adjustments for client incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and client incentives. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects purchases of $1.9 billion in U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. treasury securities, the acquisition of PlaySpan and Fundamo for $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received , and purchases of property, equipment and technology, which were higher compared to the prior year due to ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by the gross proceeds of $103 million from the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer CBSS. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements . Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of $147 million in cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to the construction of our East Coast data center. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects $2.0 billion in repurchases of our class A common stock in the open market, deposits of $1.2 billion into the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $423 million. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements . Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1.0 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, a deposit of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $368 million.  Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually-required redemption of certain series of our class C common shares for $2.6 billion, deposits of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. As of September 30, 2011, $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investments securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of undistributed earnings of $1.9 billion. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting certain securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1ARisk FactorsUnprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial  covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2011. U.S. commercial paper program . We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2011. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2011 was $2.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2011, our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Standard and Poors   Moodys  Debt type  Rating   Outlook   Rating   Outlook  Short-term unsecured debt   A-1    Stable    P-1    Stable  Long-term unsecured debt   A+    Stable    A1    Stable  ##TABLE_END Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements  of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements , as well as Sources of Liquidity . During fiscal 2011, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Share repurchase. During fiscal 2011, we used $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43.0 million class A common shares on an as-converted basis, including $2.0 billion in open market repurchases and $1.2 billion in deposits into the litigation escrow account. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. We have completed the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in April 2011 and October 2010. In July 2011, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 20, 2012. At September 30, 2011, the July share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $577 million. On October 26, 2011, we announced that our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, subject to the same terms of the July authorization. See Note 15Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2011, we paid $423 million in dividends. On October 18, 2011, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $151 million in connection with this dividend in December 2011. See Note 15Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably  estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2011, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2011, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2011, the spot P/E ratio was 14.9x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. ##TABLE_START Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $100 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $100 million   (in millions)  (in millions) 25  $2,500  $625 20  $2,000  $500 15  $1,500  $375 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. ##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees accrued benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $74 million, $66 million, and $170 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $54 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2011 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $350 million to $400 million range in fiscal 2012, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure.  Acquisitions. We acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, on March 1, 2011 and June 9, 2011, respectively. The acquisitions extend our capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce and provide long-term growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or under-banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. See Note 5Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Other uses. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements . Fair Value Measurements-Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2011, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.4 billion of assets and $176 million of liabilities. Of these securities, $176 million, or less than 3%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September, 30, 2011, debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. There was no outstanding debt at September 30, 2011. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2011.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2011. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 2Visa Europe, Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 18Commitments and Contingencies , and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements . ##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period    Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years   Total    (in millions)  Purchase orders (1)  $ 810   $ 167   $ 18   $    $ 995  Leases (2)   71    85    29    34    219  Client incentives (3)   1,795    2,558    1,439    566    6,358  Marketing and sponsorships (4)   119    214    94    86    513  Litigation settlement payments   140                140  Dividends (5)   151                151            Total (6, 7, 8)  $ 3,086   $ 3,024   $ 1,580   $ 686   $ 8,376            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future cash payments for client incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase payment product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5)  Includes dividend amount of $151 million as dividends were declared on October 18, 2011 and will be paid on December 6, 2011 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 18, 2011. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (6)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $468 million. At September 30, 2011, we also accrued $65 million of interest and $8 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7)  Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2011 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements . ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue RecognitionClient Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established. We generally capitalize certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit.  Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2011, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair ValueVisa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2011. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential.  Probability of Exercise -Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential -The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have  resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value-Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted-average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring Fundamo in June 2011, PlaySpan in March 2011 and CyberSource in July 2010, respectively, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging primarily from 1 to 15 years. See Note 5Acquisitions and Note 8Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets . Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, we evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2011. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two-step  process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we acquired Fundamo and PlaySpan, which resulted in additional goodwill. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization as of September 30, 2011. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $553 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2011. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the  allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $651 million and $627 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $651 million outstanding at September 30, 2011, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $54 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2011. See Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.  Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2011 and 2010, were $1.2 billion and $135 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2011. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $764 million and $13 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity Price Risk Visa Europe Put Option. W e have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2011. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $783 million and $766 million and projected benefit obligations were $839 million and $743 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2012, which we expect to make in September 2012. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP San Francisco, California November 17, 2011  VISA INC.

VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada) and Inovant LLC (Inovant) became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and the retrospective responsibility plan was established. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2Visa Europe . Visa Inc. is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada Corporation, Inovant LLC and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate the worlds largest retail electronic payments network. The Company provides its clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, and facilitates global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. The Company does not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on Visa-branded cards, which are the independent responsibility of the Companys issuing clients. The Company acquired PlaySpan Inc. (PlaySpan) on March 1, 2011, and Fundamo (Proprietary) Limited (Fundamo) on June 9, 2011. See Note 5Acquisitions . Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa Inc. and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Companys VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Non-controlling interests are reported as a component of equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2011, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is combined with other in the other income (expense) line on the consolidated statements of operations. Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The Company also updated select captions within the consolidated financial statements beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to better reflect underlying activities; however, the grouping of underlying financial accounts remains unchanged. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. The Companys activities are interrelated and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa Inc. as a single global business. Effective fiscal 2011, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-10, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that changed how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could materially differ from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company deposited funds from the IPO and its own funds into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid. See Note 21Legal Matters for a discussion of covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments together with the income earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the escrow account, equivalent to the actual undiscounted amount of payments expected to be made beyond one year from the balance sheet date for settled claims, is classified as a non-current asset. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in investment income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain required assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of the Companys cash equivalents (money market funds), mutual fund equity securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and exchange-traded equity securities are based on quoted prices and are therefore classified as Level 1. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 2 assets include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, and other observable inputs. Foreign exchange derivative instruments in an asset or liability position are also classified as Level 2 and are valued using inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Inputs reflect the use of significant management judgment via the use of pricing models for which the assumptions include estimates of market participant assumptions. Level 3 assets include the Companys auction rate securities. Level 3 liabilities include the Visa Europe put option and the earn-out related to the PlaySpan acquisition. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06 issued by the FASB. This ASU impacts disclosures only and requires additional information in the roll-forward of Level 3 assets and liabilities, including the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Available-for-sale securities include investments in debt and marketable equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company classifies its debt and marketable equity securities as available-for-sale to meet its operational needs. Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and stated maturities less than one year from the balance sheet date are current assets, while those with stated maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gain or loss. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in investment income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. OTTI is assessed when fair value is below amortized cost. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt securities for the periods presented are not material. In addition, the credit and non-credit loss components of debt securities on the balance sheet for which OTTI was previously recognized were not material. The Company had no OTTI for available-for-sale debt securities during fiscal 2011 and 2010. The Company recognized OTTI of $9 million during fiscal 2009 primarily related to corporate debt, mortgage backed and asset backed securities. Trading assets include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. The trading activity of these investments is dependent upon the actions of the Companys employees. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in investment income, net, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in the other line within the other income (expense) caption on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company accounts for investments in other entities under the historical cost method of accounting when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5%, and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for sale investments, accounts receivable, non-marketable equity investments, customer collateral, accounts payable, debt, settlement guarantees, derivative instruments, the Visa Europe put option, settlement receivable and payable, and the earn-out provision related to the PlaySpan acquisition. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2011 approximates their carrying value as reported on the consolidated balance sheets except as otherwise disclosed, or as deemed impracticable to estimate the fair value, such as for non-marketable equity investments. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for clearing and settling customer payment transactions. Net settlements are generally cleared within one to two business days, resulting in amounts due to and from clients. These settlement receivables and payables are stated at cost and are presented gross on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from credit, debit and travelers cheque product clearings. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management. Client incentives. The Company enters into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference for transaction routing. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established. The Company generally capitalizes certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology, net are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payment network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technologys estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements which may or may not contain lease incentives is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradename, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. The Company tests each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. The Company has historically performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company changed the annual impairment testing date from July 1 to February 1. The Company believes this change, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  preferable as the earlier date allows the Company additional time to perform the annual impairment testing after its annual forecast and budget are completed and approved. A preferability letter from the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding this change in the method of applying an accounting principle was filed as an exhibit to the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The Company performed its annual impairment review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2011, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2011. Finite-lived intangible assets include those obtained through acquisitions, and consist of customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 1 year to 15 years. Since the acquisition of these finite-lived intangible assets, no events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists. See Note 5Acquisitions and Note 8Intangible Assets, Net . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment is reviewed using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2011 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, the Company acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo, which resulted in additional goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2011, as reflected by the Companys overall business performance and market capitalization. Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Companys defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from the Companys estimates. Litigation accruals associated with settled obligations to be paid over periods longer than one year are initially recorded using the present value of future payment obligations. The obligation is accreted to its full payment value with the corresponding accretion charge included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees. See Note 21Legal Matters. Revenue recognition . The Companys operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  by costs incurred under client incentives. The Company recognizes revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues predominantly represent payments by clients with respect to their card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand, and are based principally upon spending on Visa-branded cards for goods and services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives. These revenues are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues represent revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Companys clients globally and Visa Europe. These revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSources online payment gateway and PlaySpans virtual goods payment platform. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on cardholder transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. Revenues from these cross-border transactions are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Other revenues primarily include revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement ( see Note 2Visa Europe) , and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Effective fiscal 2011, the Company adopted ASU 2009-13, which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Companys income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes to be paid for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. Historically, foreign taxes paid have generally been deducted to reduce federal income taxes payable. The Company may elect to claim foreign tax credits in the future. Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on matching the duration of a pool of high quality corporate bonds to the expected benefit payment stream, and is used to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, approximately 8.5 years for United States plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheet as other assets, accrued liabilities, and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. The Company began including annual disclosures about the fair value of its pension plan assets in fiscal 2010, as required. See Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Companys functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations. The functional currency for Visa Canada is the Canadian dollar. Translation from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  operating revenues and expenses. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the contracts at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income. See Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments. Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation for guarantees and indemnifications at inception if the fair value is estimable, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies issuing and acquiring clients from settlement losses suffered by the failure of any other customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with Visas operating regulations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company also indemnifies Visa Europe for any claims brought against Visa Europe arising out of the provision of services by Visa Inc.s customer financial institutions, as described in Note 2Visa Europe. Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market condition based awards is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on managements best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 17Share-based Compensation. Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 16Earnings Per Share. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, which will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine when it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. This guidance impacts goodwill impairment testing only and does not impact impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangibles. The Company will early adopt ASU 2011-08 effective October 1, 2011, and does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, which provides requirements over pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures related to business combinations. The ASU will require disclosure of revenue and earnings of the combined business as if the combination occurred at the start of the prior annual reporting period only. Adoption will be effective October 1, 2012, and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, which provides common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Company will adopt ASU 2011-04 effective January 1, 2012. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, which impacts the presentation of comprehensive income. The guidance requires components of other comprehensive income to be presented with net income to arrive at total comprehensive income. This ASU impacts presentation only and does not impact the underlying components of other comprehensive income or net income. The Company will adopt ASU 2011-05 effective October 1, 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2Visa Europe As part of Visas October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa Inc. common stock , a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. Visa Europe Put Option Agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa Inc. to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the put option. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europes option, which under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Companys estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. The estimated fair value of the put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The valuation of the put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa Inc. and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. The Company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $267 million at September 30, 2010 and $346 million at September 30, 2009. In determining the fair value of the put option on these dates, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 1.9x, 3.5x and 5.3x, respectively. Decreases in the P/E differential reflect the overall decrease in Visa Inc.s P/E during fiscal 2011 and 2010, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. Reductions in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash other non-operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. Visa Call Option Agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa Inc. a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option, in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATMs in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these triggers occurring to be remote.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The Framework Agreement. The relationship between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed upon circumstances. The quarterly base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately $143 million per year for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. Beginning November 9, 2010, the quarterly base fee is adjusted annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the quarterly base fee below $143 million. The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the quarterly base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. In addition to the licenses, Visa Inc. provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europes region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa Inc.s systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. The Company will indemnify Visa Europe for claims arising from activities in the field of financial payment and processing services brought outside Visa Europes region and Visa Europe will indemnify Visa Inc. for any likewise claims brought within Visa Europes region. The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be nominal at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation. These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of an escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Companys shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement and a loss sharing agreement. Escrow agreement. In accordance with the escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the litigation committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the escrow funds classified as a non-current asset is equivalent to the actual, undiscounted amount of covered litigation payments expected to be made beyond one year from the balance sheet date for settled claims. The following table sets forth the changes in the escrow account: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010    (in millions)  Balance at October 1  $ 1,936   $ 1,715  Funding under the plan   1,200    500  American Express settlement payments   (280 )   (280 ) Interest earned, less applicable taxes   1    1      Balance at September 30  $ 2,857   $ 1,936  Less: Current portion of escrow account   (2,857 )   (1,866 )     Long-term portion of escrow account  $    $ 70      ##TABLE_END An accrual for covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011. Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count. See Note 15Stockholders Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the escrow arrangement and agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange litigation. Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa Inc. has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa Inc. with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the covered litigation  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation, multiplied by such banks then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation. Omnibus agreement. On February 7, 2011, Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to certain interchange litigation. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment in the interchange litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the retrospective responsibility plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2011. Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Cash equivalents (money market funds), mutual fund equity securities, U.S. Treasury securities and exchange-traded equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the government-sponsored debt securities is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data. There was no substantive change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2011. Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. During fiscal 2011, one of the auction rate securities was called. As a result, the Company received proceeds of $10 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $4 million in investment income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. There was no substantive change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2011. Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which is carried at fair value in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011 and 2010, was $145 million and $267 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2Visa Europe. The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the put option. Earn-out related to PlaySpan acquisition. In connection with the PlaySpan acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a liability of $24 million to reflect the fair value of a potential earn-out provision included in the purchase agreement. The liability is classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs, such as the likelihood of meeting certain future revenue targets and other milestones. There was no significant change to the fair value of the potential earn-out provision during fiscal 2011. Changes in fair value are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 5Acquisitions. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis is not presented because the primary activities during fiscal 2011 and 2010 are already discussed above. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . Strategic investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  management judgment. The Company applies fair value measurement to its strategic investments when certain events or circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired. The Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were no events or circumstances that indicated these investments have become impaired during fiscal 2011, compared with impairment losses of $3 million and $7 million recognized during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2011, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary Visa International sold its 10 percent investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Solues e Servios, or CBSS. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, non-marketable equity security investments and investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $100 million and $114 million, respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . Reserve Primary Fund. The Company accounted for its investment in the Reserve Primary Fund under the cost method. After the Company determined the investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the investment was classified as a Level 3 asset. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company substantially received its remaining pro-rata ownership in the Fund, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $20 million in investment income, net during fiscal 2010, for amounts received in excess of the carrying value. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any significant non-financial liabilities. The Company measures fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a non-recurring basis for purposes of initial recognition, and testing for and recording impairment, if any. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reseller relationships and tradenames obtained through acquisitions. See Note 5Acquisitions . The Company uses an income approach for estimating the fair values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on managements judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2011, and concluded there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2011. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .  VISA INC.

In 2008, Visa Inc. entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the February 2008 Agreement). The February 2008 Agreement matures on February 15, 2013 and contains covenants and events of defaults customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in this revolving credit facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Companys class B and class C common stock, and certain of the Companys clients or affiliates of its clients. This revolving credit facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by its clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. The Company also agrees to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on the Companys credit rating.

Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Defined Benefit Pension Plan The defined benefit pension plan benefits are based on years of service, age, and eligible compensation. Prior to January 1, 2011, employees hired before January 1, 2008 earned benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earned benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees began accruing benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased accruing benefits under any other formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA. On January 12, 2010, the Company approved an amendment to the pension plan to conform the plan to the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The combined effects of the resulting plan remeasurement, as well as the completion of the annual census data update, reduced fiscal 2010 net periodic pension cost by $19 million. Participation in the plan was extended to former employees of CyberSource and PlaySpan residing in the U.S., effective August 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011, respectively, subsequent to their acquisitions. See Note 5Acquisitions . Fiscal 2011 pension cost did not materially increase and future pension cost is not expected to materially increase due to additional participants. Postretirement Benefits Plan The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million. Pension Plan Assets Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80%, fixed income securities of 25% to 35%, and other, primarily consisting of cash to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7%. At September 30, 2011, plan asset allocations for the above categories were 60%, 33% and 7% respectively, which are within these allocation ranges.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, including the impact of unsettled transactions: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measurements at September 30    Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total    2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010   2011   2010    (in millions)  Cash equivalents  $ 55   $ 46    $ 1     $ 55   $ 47  Collective investment funds    $ 289    307      289    307  Corporate debt securities     122    99      122    99  Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies     104    111      104    111  Asset-backed securities       33    26    33    26  Equity securities   180    190        180    190                  Total  $ 235   $ 236   $ 515   $ 518   $ 33   $ 26   $ 783   $ 780                  ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents . Securities classified as Level 1 primarily include money market funds and valuations for these securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Securities classified as Level 2 include a government agency discount note, which is a short-term obligation issued at discount from par. This security is traded over-the-counter and the valuation is based on inputs derived from observable market data of related assets. Collective investment funds. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefits plans, to invest in portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Although the single collective investment fund held by the plan is ultimately invested in the common stocks of companies in the SP 500 index, its own unit value is not directly observable, and it is therefore classified as Level 2. Corporate debt securities. Securities in this category primarily include fixed income securities issued by domestic and foreign corporations. Valuations for these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, and are generally classified as Level 2. Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies . These securities primarily include debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and securities issued or backed by U.S. government agencies. Valuations for these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, and are generally classified as Level 2. Asset-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Valuations for these securities are based on significant unobservable inputs. These investments are classified as Level 3. Equity securities . Securities are classified as Level 1 and include securities regularly traded on a security exchange. These securities are valued at their last quoted sales price at the reporting date, or if there was no sale on that day, the last reported bid price. This category also includes mutual funds, which are classified as Level 1, as their net asset values are observable in the market, and the access to the investment is not restricted.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2011 or 2010. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were immaterial.

Personnel costs included $34 million, $29 million and $28 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the plan. The Companys contributions to this plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, deposit access products, point-of-sale check service drivers and other instruments processed in accordance with the operating regulations. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk (or exposure) is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Companys settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Companys estimated maximum settlement exposure was approximately $47.5 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to $38.7 billion at September 30, 2010.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Of these amounts, $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below are greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeds the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START   September 30, 2011   September 30, 2010    (in millions)  Cash equivalents  $ 931   $ 899  Pledged securities at market value   296    470  Letters of credit   902    869  Guarantees   1,845    1,803      Total  $ 3,974   $ 4,041      ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Companys name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries, and the Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $1 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, which is reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments The functional currency for the Company is the U.S. dollar (USD) for the majority of its foreign operations. The Company transacts business in USD and in various foreign currencies. This activity subjects the Company to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys policy is to enter into foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to manage the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. At September 30, 2011, all derivative instruments outstanding mature within 12 months or less. The Company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge certain operational (cash flow) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of forecasted revenues and expenses being denominated in or based on currencies other than USD. The Companys rolling hedge strategy program seeks to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of the Companys foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in its exchange rate risk management program was $651 million and $627 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $651 million outstanding at September 30, 2011 is fully consistent with the Companys strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from the Companys forecast. As of September 30, 2011, the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $30 million and are classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $7 million and are classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between hedging transactions and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points was $20 million, $17 million and $14 million, respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $18 million pre-tax, the entire balance in accumulated other comprehensive income, net at September 30, 2011, to earnings during fiscal 2012. In the event there is recognized ineffectiveness or the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the designated hedge period, or it becomes remote that the forecasted transaction will occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet to general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount by which earnings were reduced relating to ineffectiveness was less than $1 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively. The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company has begun to partially mitigate this risk by entering into agreements, with certain counterparties, which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the counterparty. As of September 30, 2011, the Company has posted and received collateral of  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  $1 million and $2 million, respectively, with counterparties, which are included in prepaid and other current assets, and accrued liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2011. Note 14Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic area as follows: ##TABLE_START   September 30, 2011   September 30, 2010    (in millions)  U.S.  $ 1,487   $ 1,301  Non-U.S.   54    56      Total  $ 1,541   $ 1,357      ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Certain revenues, primarily international service revenues, are shared by geographic locations based upon the location of the merchant involved in the transaction. Revenues earned in the U.S. were approximately 56%, 58% and 58% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues are concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. In fiscal 2009, one customer accounted for 10% of the Companys net operating revenues. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2011 or 2010. See Item 1ARisk Factors. Note 15Stockholders Equity The number of shares of each class and the number of shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2011, are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions except conversion rate)  Shares Outstanding at September 30, 2011   Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock   Class A Common Stock As Converted (1)  Class A common stock   520        520  Class B common stock   245    0.4881    120  Class C common stock   47    1.0000    47      Total     687      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Figures may not sum due to rounding.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Share repurchases. The Company effectively repurchased 43.0 million shares, at an average price of $74.94 per share, for a total cost of $3.2 billion during fiscal 2011. Of the $3.2 billion, $2.0 billion was executed through the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market, and $1.2 billion was effectively executed through two separate deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market during the following fiscal years: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010    (in millions, except per share data)  Shares repurchased in the open market   26.6    12.9  Weighted-average repurchase price per share  $ 76.08   $ 77.48  Total cost  $ 2,024   $ 1,000  ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company completed three share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in April, 2011, October, 2010 and October, 2009, for an aggregate of $2.6 billion. All repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. The Company made no share repurchases in the open market during fiscal 2009. In July, 2011, the Companys board of directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. The authorization will be in effect through July 20, 2012, and the terms of the program are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors. At September 30, 2011, the July share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $577 million. In October, 2011, the Company announced that its board of directors authorized a $1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, subject to the same terms of the July authorization. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company made deposits of $400 million, $800 million and $500 million into the litigation escrow account on March 31, 2011, October 8, 2010 and May 28, 2010, respectively. Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes deposits into the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count as shown in the table below. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2011   Fiscal 2010    March 2011   October 2010   May 2010    (in millions except per share data and conversion rate)  Deposits under the retrospective responsibility plan  $ 400   $ 800   $ 500  Effective price per share (1)  $ 73.81   $ 72.74   $ 74.22  Equivalent shares of class A common stock repurchased   5.4    11.0    6.7  Conversion rate of class B common stock to class A common stock after deposits   0.4881    0.5102    0.5550  As-converted class B common stock after deposits   120    125    136  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Effective price per share calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Companys class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation. ##TABLE_END  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Class B Common Stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the covered litigation has been finally resolved, although the Companys board of directors may make exceptions to this transfer restriction after resolution of all covered litigation. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa member or similar person or affiliate of a Visa member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. Accelerated Class C Share Release Programs. The Companys board of directors approved three separate accelerated class C share release programs in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, in which holders of class C common stock were permitted to liquidate their class C common stock, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under these programs, 55 million, 56 million and 40 million shares of class C common stock were released from transfer restrictions during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of September 30, 2011, all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and 104 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred Stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. Voting Rights. The holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. All holders of class B and class C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any consolidation, merger, combination or any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the holders of class B and class C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or class C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends Declared. On October 18, 2011, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 6, 2011 to all holders of record of the Companys class A, class B and class C common stock as of November 18, 2011. The Company declared and paid $423 million in dividends in fiscal 2011 at a quarterly rate of $0.15 per share.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  Note 16Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class and series by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units during the period. Net income is allocated to each class and series of common stock based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted number of shares of each class and series of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods. See Note 15Stockholders Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities in the form of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period, consisting of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of class B and class C common stock based on the conversion rate in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The weighted average numbers of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were 123 million, 141 million and 157 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Companys restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) Net income attributable to Visa Inc. was allocated to the shares of redeemed common stock for the period during which they were outstanding. ##TABLE_END Note 17Share-based Compensation The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options, or options, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 59 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of $154 million, $135 million and $115 million,  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. Of the $154 million share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2011, $6 million related to the immediate recognition of expense on awards granted to employees who had reached eligible retirement age. Of the $135 million recognized in fiscal 2010, $4 million relates to expense recognized upon the CyberSource acquisition that was paid in cash. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation expense is immaterial during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010 (5)   2009  Expected term (in years) (1)   5.16    3.46    5.69  Risk-free rate of return (2)   1.2 %   1.4 %   2.7 % Expected volatility (3)   33.4 %   36.4 %   44.2 % Expected dividend yield (4)   0.8 %   0.7 %   0.7 % Weighted-average fair value per option granted  $ 27.50   $ 29.46   $ 23.54  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1)  Based on a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the average of the Companys implied and historical volatility. As the Companys publicly traded stock history is relatively short, historical volatility relies in part on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The expected volatilities ranged from 31% to 34% in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5)  Includes the impact of 1.6 million replacement awards issued to former CyberSource employees as part of the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010. These awards have a weighted-average exercise price of $47.34 per share and vest over a period of less than three years from the replacement grant date. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the Companys option activity for fiscal 2011: ##TABLE_START   Options   Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share   Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)   Aggregate Intrinsic Value (3) (in millions)  Outstanding at October 1, 2010   9,942,379   $ 49.30    Granted (1)   977,447    74.32    Forfeited/expired   (202,256 )   63.86    Exercised   (2,163,181 )   45.36         Outstanding at September 30, 2011   8,554,389    52.81    6.6   $ 282  Options exercisable at September 30, 2011   6,074,687    47.10    6.4   $ 235  Options exercisable and expected to be vested at September 30, 2011 (2)   8,232,404   $ 52.46    6.6   $ 274  ##TABLE_END  VISA INC.

The aggregate intrinsic value excludes stock options with an option exercise price greater than $85.72. ##TABLE_END For the options exercised during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the total intrinsic value was $77 million, $42 million and $16 million, respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $28 million, $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2011, there was $35 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $79.80, $79.58 and $56.46, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $79.97, $79.59 and $56.64, respectively. The total fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $55 million, $32 million and $78 million, respectively.

During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based shares granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $85.05, $88.06 and $56.06 per share, respectively. Of the performance shares granted in fiscal 2009, 295,736 shares were earned based on the Companys achievement of specified adjusted net income performance targets during the one-year period ended September 30, 2009. The fiscal 2009 grants did not include additional performance conditions. Compensation expense for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance and recorded net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. Performance shares vest in two equal installments approximately two and three years from the date of the grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. At September 30, 2011, there was $10 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares.  VISA INC.

For these obligations, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly in excess of the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client Incentives. The Company has agreements with select clients for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase the acceptance of its products and win merchant preference for transaction routing. These agreements, with original terms ranging from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization and obligations incurred under these programs are included on the balance sheet. Obligations under these customer agreements are primarily amortized as a reduction to revenue in the same period as the related revenues are earned, based on managements estimate of the customers performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of customer incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2011: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   Thereafter   Total  Client incentives  $ 1,634   $ 1,519   $ 1,170   $ 833   $ 558   $ 472   $ 6,186  ##TABLE_END The actual amounts that are recorded will be greater or less than the estimates above due to customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed this estimate, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Although the Companys ability to utilize the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards was limited in fiscal 2011, the Company expects to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2011, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $8 million and $21 million, respectively. The federal carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2017 through 2028. The state carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $1 million, which do not expire. The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% to pretax income, as a result of the following: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended September 30    2011   2010   2009    Dollars   Percent   Dollars   Percent   Dollars   Percent    (in millions)      (in millions)      (in millions)     U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate  $ 1,980    35 %  $ 1,623    35 %  $ 1,400    35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   203    4 %   177    4 %   156    4 % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit   (150 )   (2 )%   (124 )   (2 )%   7      Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to change in state apportionment   (3 )       15              Non-U.S. tax on sale of VisaNet do Brasil, net of federal benefit                   51    1 % Revaluation of Visa Europe put option   (43 )   (1 )%   (28 )   (1 )%         Other, net   23        11        34    1 %             Income tax provision  $ 2,010    36 %  $ 1,674    36 %  $ 1,648    41 %             ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, the Companys largest operating hub outside the U.S., beneficial changes in the geographic mix of the Companys global income, the nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010, and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of the investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Income taxes receivable of $112 million and $140 million are included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2011 and 2010, income taxes payable of $63 million and $40 million, respectively, are included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $468 million and $423 million, respectively, are included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 9Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries amounted to $1.9 billion at September 30, 2011, all of which are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the U.S. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practically determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the U.S. is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2014, and may be extended through September 30, 2023, if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentive agreement is conditional upon certain employment and investment thresholds being met by the Company. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $111 million, $93 million and $16 million, and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.16, $0.13 and $0.02 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In accordance with ASC 740, the Company is required to inventory, evaluate, and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $850 million and $545 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $850 million and $545 million are $696 million and $443 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010    (in millions)  Beginning balance at October 1  $ 545   $ 439  Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years   206    65  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years   (52 )     Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year   158    44  Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits related to lapsing statute of limitations   (7 )   (3 )     Ending balance at September 30  $ 850   $ 545      ##TABLE_END It is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense, and general and administrative, respectively, in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $7 million, $37 million and $17 million of interest expense, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2011, the Company reversed $2 million of penalties upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $5 million and $4 million of penalties, respectively. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had accrued interest of $65 million and $58 million, respectively, and accrued penalties of $8 million and $10 million, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities. The Companys fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The most significant areas being examined by the IRS include transfer pricing, deduction for covered litigation and research and development tax credits. The timing of the final resolution of the tax examination is uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcome could have on the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the federal statutes of limitations expired for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2006. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. The Company has concluded all California income tax matters for years through fiscal 2003. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. Note 21Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could in the future incur  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The Company recorded litigation provisions of approximately $7 million, ($45) million and $2 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers litigation (discussed in Other Litigation below). The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals for certain legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on managements understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation for both covered and other non-covered litigation for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010: ##TABLE_START   2011   2010    (in millions)  Balance at October 1  $ 697   $ 1,717  Provision for settled legal matters (1)   7    (45 ) Reclassification of settled matters (2)   12      Interest accretion on settled matters   11    27  Payments on settled matters (3)   (302 )   (1,002 )     Balance at September 30  $ 425   $ 697      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The amount for the twelve months ended September 30, 2010 includes the reduction to the provision for the $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers litigation. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Reclassification of amount previously recorded in accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  The amount for the twelve months ended September 30, 2010 includes the Companys October 2009 prepayment of its remaining $800 million in payment obligations in the Retailers litigation at a discounted amount of $682 million. ##TABLE_END Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are subject to the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . An accrual for covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The current uncommitted balance of the covered litigation escrow account$2.7 billionwas deposited by the Company primarily with a view toward resolving the Interchange Litigation. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The Discover Litigation. On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard). The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was designated as a related case to a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 1998. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the implementation and enforcement of Visas bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards Competitive Programs Policy, or CPP, which prohibited their respective members from issuing American Express or Discover cards violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Californias Unfair Competition Law, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys fees and costs. On October 13, 2008, Visa, MasterCard and Discover reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. The parties executed a final settlement agreement on October 27, 2008 that became effective on November 4, 2008 upon approval by holders of Visas class B common stock. Visas net share of the settlement totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1.74 billion was paid over four quarters from the escrow account established by the retrospective responsibility plan. Visa Inc. also paid $80 million toward Visas share in connection with releases obtained from MasterCard with respect to certain potential claims. Visa Inc. also paid an additional $65 million, which was refunded by Morgan Stanley, under a separate agreement related to the settlement. Visas settlement obligations were fully satisfied with the September 2009 payment to Discover. The Companys consolidated statement of operations reflects a provision of $1.8 billion for the settlement in fiscal 2008. The American Express Litigation. On November 15, 2004, American Express filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard and several Visa U.S.A. and Visa International member financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of Visa U.S.A.s bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards CPP violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys fees and costs. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a settlement agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007. Under the settlement agreement, American Express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from Visa Inc. and $185 million from five co-defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made on March 31, 2008, including $945 million funded through the litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning April 2008, Visa Inc. will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. The quarterly settlement payments are also covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The total settlement was recorded in fiscal 2007 at a discounted value of $1.9 billion using a rate of 4.72% over the payment term. The present value of the remaining obligation is reflected in current and long-term accrued litigation obligation on the consolidated balance sheets. The quarterly payments are in an amount equal to 5% of American Expresss United States global network services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of $70 million per quarter; provided, however, that if the payment for any quarter is less than $70 million, the maximum payment for a future quarter or quarters shall be increased by the difference between $70 million and such lesser amount as was actually paid. American Express has met the performance criteria set forth in the settlement agreement for each quarter thus far, including the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2011, and Visa has made each of the corresponding settlement payments.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  The Attridge Litigation. On December 8, 2004, a complaint was filed in California state court on behalf of an alleged class of consumers asserting claims against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard under Californias Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law. The claims in this action, Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al ., seek to piggyback on the portion of the DOJ litigation in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Visas bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCards CPP constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. On May 19, 2006, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs Cartwright Act claims with prejudice but allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his Unfair Competition Law claims, which seek restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees and costs. On December 14, 2007, the plaintiff amended his complaint to add Visa Inc. as a defendant. No new claims were added to the complaint. On July 1, 2009, the court denied in part the Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication, but ordered the parties to submit affidavits as to whether further discovery should be conducted prior to the court rendering judgment on the Motion for Summary Adjudication. On August 3, 2009, the court ruled the Motion submitted without any such further discovery. In the separate Indirect Purchaser Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases, also pending in California state court, Visa entered into a settlement agreement on September 14, 2009. That settlement could potentially have the effect of releasing the claims asserted in the Attridge case, subject to the ruling of the Attridge court. On September 24, 2009, the Attridge court deferred its decision on the Motion for Summary Adjudication pending court approval of the settlement in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases . On August 23, 2010, final approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement was granted. The plaintiff in Attridge and others have appealed the final approval order. On February 15, 2011, the court ordered that the case be stayed until 30 days following the final resolution of the appeals in the California Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases . The Interchange Litigation Kendall. On October 8, 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Visa U.S.A., MasterCard and several Visa U.S.A. member financial institutions alleging, among other things, that Visa U.S.A.s and MasterCards interchange reimbursement fees violate the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act ( Kendall v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al .). On July 25, 2005, the court granted Visa U.S.A.s motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On March 7, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal of the complaint. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a conspiracy, and that no amendment could cure the pleading defect. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were indirect purchasers of Visa U.S.A. and could not recover antitrust damages for their claims. Plaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuits ruling. Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL). Beginning in May 2005, approximately 55 complaints, all but 10 of which were styled as class actions, have been filed in U.S. federal district courts on behalf of merchants against Visa U.S.A. and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. Visa International was also named as a defendant in more than 30 of these complaints. The cases allege, among other things, that Visas and MasterCards purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their no surcharge rules, and alleged tying and bundling of  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  transaction fees violate federal antitrust laws. On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings (MDL 1720). On April 24, 2006, the group of purported class plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint. Taken together, the claims in the First Amended Class Action Complaint and in the 10 complaints brought on behalf of individual merchants are generally brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In addition, some of these complaints contain certain state unfair competition law claims. These interchange-related cases seek money damages (alleged in the consolidated class action complaint to range in the tens of billions of dollars), subject to trebling, as well as attorneys fees and injunctive relief. As part of the retrospective responsibility plan, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a judgment sharing agreement with certain member financial institutions of Visa U.S.A. on July 1, 2007. On January 8, 2008, the district court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and granted defendants motion to dismiss the class plaintiffs claims for damages incurred prior to January 1, 2004. On January 29, 2009, class plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Among other things, this complaint: (i) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visa PIN-debit cards; (ii) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants since the time of Visas IPO regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visas credit, offline debit, and PIN-debit cards; (iii) eliminated claims for damages relating to the so-called no-surcharge rule and anti-steering rules; (iv) eliminated claims for damages based on the alleged tie of network processing services and payment guarantee services to the payment card system services; and (v) added Visa Inc. as a defendant. In addition, class plaintiffs filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint (the Supplemental Complaint) against Visa Inc. and several financial institutions challenging Visas reorganization and IPO under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act. In the Supplemental Complaint, class plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. On May 8, 2008, class plaintiffs served on defendants a motion seeking to certify a class of merchants. Visa, jointly with other defendants, moved to dismiss the Supplemental Complaint and the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on March 31, 2009. On February 7, 2011, Visa entered into an omnibus agreement that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to certain interchange litigation. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the Omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Companys retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. The parties filed motions for summary judgment on a number of issues on February 11, 2011. Visa, jointly with other defendants, moved for summary judgment against the claims in the Supplemental Complaint and the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Visa and other defendants also moved for summary judgment against the claims in the individual plaintiffs complaints. The class plaintiffs sought summary judgment on all of their intra-network damages claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, including by arguing that Visas post-IPO conduct constitutes a continuing conspiracy. Finally, the individual plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their claims that (i) agreements by banks to enforce certain Visa rules are per se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and (ii) Visas imposition of those rules post-IPO constitutes a continuing conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The parties have exchanged expert reports and taken expert discovery. The court asked the parties to identify any objections to a trial date of September 12, 2012, and no party has objected to that date. The parties efforts to reach a mediated resolution of the litigation continue, though substantial hurdles exist. In particular, plaintiffs confidential settlement demands to Visa have included unacceptable changes to Visas business practices and unacceptable financial terms. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company believes some loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and reasonably estimable. Many material uncertainties exist, including, among other things, the mixed progress in settlement negotiations and numerous motions pending before the court. The current uncommitted balance of the covered litigation escrow account$2.7 billionis consistent with the Companys estimate of its share of a lower end of a negotiated settlement for the entire matter. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties and mediation obstacles that persist, including the unacceptable changes to our business practices demanded by plaintiffs. We are unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if a negotiated resolution of the matter cannot be reached. Other Litigation In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation. Beginning in October 1996, several antitrust class action lawsuits were brought by U.S. merchants against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard. The suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . Among other claims, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa U.S.A.s Honor All Cards rule, which required merchants that accepted Visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented Visa card, and a similar MasterCard rule, constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On June 4, 2003, the parties signed a settlement agreement that was approved by the court on December 19, 2003. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Visa agreed to modify its Honor All Cards rule such that a merchant may accept only Visa check cards, only Visa credit cards, or both. Visa also agreed to pay approximately $2.0 billion to the merchant class over 10 years in equal annual installments of $200 million per year, among other things.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  On August 31, 2009, Visa entered into an agreement to prepay its remaining $800 million in settlement payments for $682 million. On October 2, 2009, the court entered a final order approving the prepayment agreement, and Visa made the prepayment on October 5, 2009. Pursuant to its terms, the prepayment agreement became final after no appeals to the approval order were filed within the 30-day appeal period. Indirect Purchaser Actions. Complaints were also filed in 19 different states and the District of Columbia alleging state antitrust, consumer protection and common law claims against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard (and, in California, Visa International) on behalf of consumers. The claims in these class actions included allegations mirroring those made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and asserting that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs seek money damages and injunctive relief. Visa U.S.A. has been successful in the majority of these cases, as courts in 17 jurisdictions have granted Visa U.S.A.s motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaints. In New Mexico, the court granted Visa U.S.A.s motion to dismiss at a hearing on May 14, 2010, and entered an order and judgment dismissing the case on June 9, 2010. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from that order and judgment on June 14, 2010. Briefing is complete in the appeal, but no decision has been issued. In California, in the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , the court dismissed claims brought under the Cartwright Act, but denied a similar motion with respect to Unfair Competition Law claims for unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices. On October 31, 2007, the court denied the plaintiffs motion to give collateral estoppel effect to certain elements of their tying claim based on statements in the ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment in In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . On October 3, 2008, the parties agreed to confidential settlement terms to resolve the dispute. A written settlement agreement executed on September 14, 2009, was submitted to the court for approval. After the parties amended the settlement agreement in certain respects, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on January 5, 2010 and entered an order granting final approval on August 23, 2010. The plaintiff in Attridge , who had filed objections to the settlement, filed a notice of appeal from the final approval order, as have other objectors to the settlement. The amount of the settlement is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. Currency Conversion Litigation. In 2000, a representative action was filed in California state court against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International in connection with an asserted 1% currency conversion fee assessed on member financial institutions by the payment card networks on transactions involving the purchase of goods or services in a foreign currency and the disclosure of that fee ( Schwartz ). Plaintiffs claimed Visas currency conversion practices violated California Business  Professions Code Section 17200. Additional California state class actions were filed against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International challenging currency conversion practices ( Shrieve, Mattingly , and Baker ). Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard, Citicorp Diners Club, Inc. (Diners Club) and several Visa member financial institutions are also defendants in a number of federal class actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal antitrust laws based on the 1% currency conversion fee. The federal complaints were consolidated or coordinated in MDL 1409 ( In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 20, 2006, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a settlement agreement in MDL 1409. Under the terms of that settlement, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International paid $100.1 million  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  into a settlement fund and agreed that for five years they would separately identify or itemize any fees added to transactions because they occurred in a foreign country or involved a foreign currency and would require U.S. issuing members to disclose certain changes, if any, to exchange rate practices. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International also paid into the settlement fund $18.6 million in attorneys fees to resolve Schwartz . The Shrieve , Mattingly , and Baker plaintiffs agreed that they would ask the court to dismiss their actions with prejudice as to Visa U.S.A. and Visa International once the MDL 1409 settlement receives court approval. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International agreed to pay $1.0 million plus interest as attorneys fees after the dismissal of Baker . The court granted final approval of the MDL 1409 settlement on October 22, 2009. Various appeals were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. All such appeals were dismissed as of May 11, 2011. All of the underlying actions against Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, including Schwartz, Shrieve, Mattingly, and Baker, have been dismissed, and Visa has made all payments required under the settlement agreements. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter/Discover Litigation. In August 2004, the European Commission in Brussels issued a Statement of Objections against Visa International and Visa Europe alleging a breach of European competition law. The allegation arises from the Visa International and Visa Europe Rule (bylaw 2.12(b)) that makes certain designated competitors, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter/Discover, ineligible for membership. On October 3, 2007, the European Commission fined Visa International and Visa Europe  10.2 million ($14.5 million) for infringing European Union rules on restrictive business practices (Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement). Visa International and Visa Europe filed an appeal of the ruling with the Court of First Instance on December 19, 2007. On April 14, 2011, the European Union General Court denied Visas appeal of the  10.2 million fine. Pursuant to existing agreements, Visa Europe has acknowledged full responsibility for the defense of this action, including any fines that may be payable. Vale Canjeable. On November 21, 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A. filed an action in the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas (Fifth Municipal court), Venezuela against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the Visa Vale mark in Venezuela. On November 29, 2006, the Fifth Municipal court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants use of Vale in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers. Visa filed a constitutional objection to that ruling on December 6, 2006. The objection was dismissed, and Visa appealed the decision through the appellate courts. After all appeals to the lower appellate courts had been rejected, on March 14, 2008, Visa filed an extraordinary appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling with the Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court). On August 6, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Visas favor, declared the lower courts decision null and void, and remanded the case to the appellate court. Following the Supreme Courts order, on March 25, 2009, the First Commercial Judge of Appeals of Caracas issued a new decision, affirming the preliminary injunction and finding Visa and Todoticket liable for legal fees and costs in connection with the appeal. On July 9, 2009, Visa filed a further appeal, and on December 10, 2009, the Supreme Court again decided in Visas favor, overturning the appellate ruling. The Supreme Court ordered a new appellate judge to consider the preliminary injunction that prevented Visa from using the Visa Vale trademark in Venezuela. On August 10, 2011, the court rejected Visas appeal of the preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to pay costs.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  In parallel to this proceeding, in December 2006, the plaintiff also filed a claim with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas (First Instance court), alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiffs rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting declarative, injunctive and monetary relief. On September 25, 2007, Visas request for removal of the First Instance judge from the case was granted. A new judge was assigned to finalize the discovery phase of the case. On February 11, 2010, the First Instance court dismissed in its entirety the plaintiffs claim against Visa and other defendants for damages based on trademark infringement. The plaintiff appealed. On August 10, 2011, the appellate court overturned the First Instance courts dismissal in part. The court refused to award plaintiff any damages or costs, but enjoined Visa and Todoticket from using the expression Vale in the Venezuelan food voucher market. Both August 10 rulings are subject to an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Court. U.S. Merchant Acceptance Rules Investigations. On October 10, 2008, the DOJ issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, to Visa U.S.A. that sought information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID sought documents, data and narrative responses to several interrogatories and document requests, which focused on certain U.S. merchant acceptance practices, including major payment network rules regarding merchant surcharging and merchants ability to steer customers to other forms of payment. A multistate attorney general working group and other state attorney general offices requested similar information from Visa Inc. in 2009. On October 4, 2010, Visa announced a settlement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of seven states to resolve their investigations. Additional states joined the settlement on December 20, 2010. As part of the settlement, Visa will allow U.S. merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer customers to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to any card product, such as a non-reward Visa credit card. Visas rules always have allowed U.S. merchants to steer customers to other forms of payment and offer discounts to customers who choose to pay with cash, check or PIN debit. The new rules will expand U.S. merchants ability to discount for their preferred form of payment, though they will not be able to pick and choose amongst issuing banks. The settlement agreement does not address Visas rule prohibiting U.S. merchants from surcharging consumers. Apart from a partial reimbursement to some of the state attorneys general of their attorneys fees and expenses, there is no monetary obligation associated with the settlement. The reimbursement amount is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The consent decree setting forth the terms of settlement was subject to court approval. After responding to public comments it received regarding the consent decree, on July 14, 2011, the DOJ asked the court to enter final judgment as soon as possible without further hearing. The settlement became final on July 20, 2011, when the court entered final judgment approving the consent decree, and Visa has made the rule changes required by the settlement. Venezuela Interchange Proceedings. On October 2, 2008, the Superintendencia para la Promocin y Proteccin de la Libre Competencia (Competition Authority) of Venezuela filed an administrative proceeding against Visa Inc. International (sic), MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, Consorcio Credicard, and more than thirty privately held financial institutions. The Competition Authority alleged that, among other things, the defendants setting of default interchange rates and merchant discount rates violated Venezuelan competition law. The Competition Authority sought  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  monetary and injunctive relief. On December 29, 2010, the Competition Authority issued a decision that it had found no violation of Venezuelan competition law by Visa or any of the other defendants. European Interchange Proceedings. On April 3, 2009, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections (SO) to Visa Europe, Visa International and Visa Inc. alleging a breach of European competition law. Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with the Statement of Objections on June 1, 2009. The SO alleged a breach of Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The SO was directed to Visa Inc. and Visa International with respect to the Honor All Cards rule, the no-surcharge rule, and certain debit interchange fee practices. On August 10, 2009, Visa Inc. and Visa International filed a response to the SO. On April 26, 2010, Visa Europe announced an agreement with the European Commission, subject to public consultation, to end the proceedings with respect to Visa Europes immediate debit interchange fees. After public consultation, on December 8, 2010, the European Commission concluded that the proposed agreement with Visa Europe addressed its competition concerns, made the agreement legally binding upon Visa Europe, and closed its investigation with regard to interchange fees for debit card transactions. For credit card and deferred debit card payments, the European Commission announced that it will continue to investigate. Meanwhile, it has issued further requests for information to Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International and commissioned a cost-of-cash study. Pursuant to existing agreements among the parties, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa International and Visa Inc. in connection with this proceeding, including payment of any fines that may be imposed. Canadian Competition Proceedings Competition Bureau. On April 21, 2009, Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada) received an oral notification from the Canadian Competition Bureau that it had initiated a civil inquiry regarding interchange and certain of Visa policies relating to merchant acceptance practices. The Bureau issued a voluntary draft information request to Visa on August 4, 2010, seeking information about certain merchant acceptance practices, interchange (including the setting of default interchange), and fees paid by issuers and acquirers to Visa. On December 15, 2010, the Commissioner of Competition filed a Notice of Application against Visa Canada and MasterCard. The proceeding challenges certain Visa policies regarding merchant acceptance practices, including Visas no-surcharge and honour all cards policies under the Competition Act. Visa Canada filed a Response to the Notice of Application on January 31, 2011. On February 10, 2011, Toronto Dominion Bank and the Canadian Bankers Association sought leave to intervene in the proceeding; Visa supported such requests. Following a hearing on March 7, 2011, the Competition Tribunal granted the intervention requests. The hearing before the Competition Tribunal on the merits of the case is scheduled to begin on April 23, 2012. Merchant Litigation . On December 17, 2010, a purported civil follow-on case to the Competition Bureaus proceeding was filed against Visa Canada and MasterCard in the Superior Court of Qubec, Canada, on behalf of a class of merchants and a class of consumers. The action, 9085-4886 Quebec Inc. et al. v. Visa Canada et al. , asserts claims under Section 76 of the Competition Act, which does not provide for a civil cause of action. Plaintiff seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief.  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  On March 28, 2011, Mary Watson filed a class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, on behalf of merchants and others in Canada that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard ( Watson ). The suit, filed against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and ten financial institutions, alleges conduct contrary to section 45 of the Competition Act and also asserts claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiff alleges that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCards respective no-surcharge and honour all cards rules had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On May 16, 2011, a merchant class action that effectively mirrors the Watson case was initiated in Ontario ( Bancroft-Snell ). As in Watson , the Bancroft-Snell complaint alleges conduct in contravention of Section 45 of the Competition Act, civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among other claims, and seeks similar relief. Restricted Spending Solutions, LLC-Prepaid and Commercial Cards . On June 23, 2009, Restricted Spending Solutions, LLC filed a lawsuit against Visa U.S.A. and a number of other companies in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that certain Visa prepaid and commercial cards infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,044,360 (Third Party Credit Card). Plaintiff sought money damages and injunctive relief. On October 30, 2009, Visa U.S.A. answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that Visa is not infringing the patent and/or that the patent is invalid. Visa U.S.A. filed a First Amended Answer and Counterclaim on November 19, 2009. On February 5, 2010, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity based on Visas U.S. Patent 5,500,513. The court granted defendants motion on September 29, 2010. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on October 28, 2010. On December 22, 2010, Visa moved to recover its attorneys fees incurred in the litigation on grounds that, at the outset of the case, plaintiff improperly refused to acknowledge the invalidity of its patent when presented with Visas evidence. On January 27, 2011, plaintiff and Visa filed a stipulation of settlement, whereby plaintiff agreed to withdraw its appeal and pay Visas litigation costs in exchange for Visas withdrawal of its fee petition. CyberSource securities litigation. On April 29, 2010, an individual named Carol Ann Peters filed a class action lawsuit against CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), certain of its directors, and Visa Inc. in California Superior Court in connection with the proposed merger of CyberSource and Visa. The complaint asserted claims of breach of fiduciary duty against the CyberSource directors and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty against CyberSource and Visa. Plaintiff later added Market Street Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Inc., as a defendant and sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys fees. A similar lawsuit was filed on May 4, 2010, by the Inter-Local Pension Fund of the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. The Delaware complaint was voluntarily dismissed and re-filed in California Superior Court on June 1, 2010, adding allegations of inadequate disclosure in CyberSources preliminary proxy statement concerning the merger. On June 9, 2010, the California court consolidated the two suits, now captioned In re CyberSource Shareholder Litigation . On June 29, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. The agreement required CyberSource to make certain additional disclosures related to the proposed merger, which were made in CyberSources definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 11,  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  2010, but did not require any defendant to pay money damages. A notice of the settlement, which was subject to confirmatory discovery and court approval, was filed on July 13, 2010. On September 16, 2010, following completion of confirmatory discovery, the parties filed formal settlement documents with the court. On November 10, 2010, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and directing that notice of the settlement be provided to potential class members. The court held a final approval hearing on January 14, 2011 and issued an order and final judgment approving the settlement on January 21, 2011. The settlement amount is not considered material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Dynamic Currency Conversion. Visa has received notices from competition regulators in New Zealand, Korea, and Australia regarding investigations into Visas policies relating to the provision of Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) services. DCC refers to the conversion of the purchase price of goods or services from one currency to another at the point of sale as agreed to by the cardholder and merchant. In New Zealand, the Commerce Commission completed its investigation and in February 2011 concluded that Visas policies relating to DCC had not breached New Zealands competition law. In May 2011, the Korean Fair Trade Commission also closed its investigation. The investigation by the competition regulator in Australia (the ACCC) is pending and includes Visas policies relating to currency conversion on cash withdrawals. The ACCC has the authority to commence proceedings before the Federal Court of Australia and seek an injunction or find if it can establish a breach of competition laws. No such proceedings have been commenced, and the potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. Data pass litigation. On August 27, 2010, a consumer filed a class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and Visa Inc. in federal district court in Connecticut. The plaintiff claims, among other things, that consumers who made online purchases at Amazon.com were deceived into also incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the alleged unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (data pass), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. Visa allegedly aided and abetted the conduct of the other defendants. Plaintiff seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Amazon.com as a defendant without prejudice on October 29, 2010. Webloyalty.com and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the case on November 1, 2010. On November 19, 2010, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding GameStop Corporation as a defendant, asserting additional claims against Visa under federal and state consumer protection statutes and state common law, and seeking certification of a class of persons and entities whose credit card or debit card data was improperly accessed by Webloyalty.com since October 1, 2008. Webloyalty.com asked the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate with this case, for pretrial proceedings, a case pending in federal district court in California in which Webloyalty.com and Movietickets.com (but not Visa) are named as defendants. On February 8, 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied Webloyalty.coms application to consolidate the case. On December 23, 2010, Webloyalty.com, GameStop, and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Call center litigation . On April 28, 2011, Francisco Marenco filed a request in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to amend his class action complaint to name Visa Inc. as the  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2011 (in millions, except as noted)  defendant. The court granted the request and Marenco filed the amended complaint on May 6, 2011. The lawsuit alleges that Visa recorded telephone calls to call center representatives without providing a disclosure that the calls may be recorded, in alleged violation of state law in California and several other states. On May 31, 2011, the parties executed a settlement agreement in an amount that is not material to Visas consolidated financial statements. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 20, 2011, and set a final approval hearing for November 28, 2011, after the class notice process is complete. This matter relates to and resolves the previously reported contractual indemnity claim tendered to Visa by a processing client in October 2010. Korean Fair Trade Commission. Following a complaint lodged by a Visa client, in July 2011 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) initiated an investigation into Visas requirements for the processing of international transactions over VisaNet. The KFTC has the authority to issue an injunction or fine; the potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. Visa is cooperating with the investigation. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation. National ATM Council class action. On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa USA, and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visas rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. The plaintiffs claim that the rule prevents non-bank ATM operators from attracting customers through lower prices, allegedly in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaint requests injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and damages in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling. Consumer class actions . In October 2011, three consumer class actions were filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. One case, Genese , adds three financial institutions as defendants. All three cases purport to represent classes of consumers in claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Stoumbos adds claims under antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes in certain states and the District of Columbia, and Bartron adds claims on behalf of sub-classes of consumers under such state laws. The consumer suits seek injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and treble damages; Bartron and Stoumbos also seek restitution where available under state law. Note 22Subsequent Events On October 18, 2011, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 15Stockholders Equity. On October 26, 2011, the Companys board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to its July 2011 share repurchase program, subject to the same terms as the existing program.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2011 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors in this report. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2011.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2011, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services that we provide. Business developments in fiscal 2012 included the following: ##TABLE_START  Regulation . New rules were implemented in the United States with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates, among other things, interchange fees, the debit networks issuers make available, merchants' choices among these networks and transaction routing. These regulations resulted in our renegotiating some portions of client contracts. See Government Regulation below .  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  U.S. Debit Strategy. We have designed or implemented several modifications to our U.S. debit strategy to ensure compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interchange. We established new debit interchange rate structures, effective October 2011 and revised in April 2012, for the Visa Consumer Check card, Interlink and Small Business Debit. Two distinct interchange schedules were established: one for exempt issuers and products and a second for regulated issuers and products. In addition, in order to ensure that transactions within a U.S. territory, transactions between U.S. territories, and transactions between the U.S. and U.S. territories receive the applicable, regulated interchange rate, we established two new inter-regional schedules for regulated debit card and Interlink transactions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Certification Program. In order to correctly identify regulated issuers, their exempt products and their compliance with the Federal Reserve's fraud prevention standards, we implemented a ##TABLE_END 4 certification process for regulated issuers. The program enables issuers to accurately register their exempt and non-exempt portfolios and to certify their compliance with these rules and criteria. In July 2012, the Federal Reserve announced its final fraud prevention standards, including clarifying the requirement that issuers notify their payment networks of their compliance with the final fraud standard (rather than certify such compliance). ##TABLE_START  Rule Changes. We implemented changes to our Operating Regulations to the extent necessary to support the ability of issuers to enable unaffiliated payment card networks on Visa debit cards issued in the U.S. or U.S. territories, as well as to enable Visa-owned debit networks on non-Visa debit cards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fees . We restructured our acquirer pricing and implemented a fixed fee and lowered our variable per transaction fees. These changes are intended to increase our competitiveness and incent merchants to route more transactions over the Visa network.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  PAVD : We implemented programs to ensure that Visa debit issuers were capable of validating and authorizing PIN Authenticated Visa Debit transactions for any merchants choosing to route Visa Debit transactions to Visa using PIN authentication. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Merchant Litigation Settlement. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States, subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals. Visa will prepare for implementation in the early part of 2013. See Item 1ARisk FactorsOur retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments. and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 21Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client Contracts. We continued to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth by successfully executing several major client contracts throughout the year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Ongoing Growth. The progress towards economic recovery and secular shift from cash and checks to electronic payments helped to drive double-digit percentage growth across our three primary revenue driverspayments volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactionswhich contributed to our 13% growth in year-over-year net operating revenues for fiscal 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2012 Olympic Games: For this year's Summer Olympic Games in London, Visa engaged a record number of clients in its sponsorship program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions and merchants across more than 70 geographies worldwide, activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. ##TABLE_END Industry Overview We operate in the global payments industry, which is undergoing a powerful secular shift towards electronic payments, whether delivered in physical, card-based form or virtually via mobile or eCommerce platforms, and away from paper-based payments, such as cash and checks. For more than 50 years, we have played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers, businesses, governments and merchants. We believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms. We also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency, control and security, and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience.  The global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer, including: ##TABLE_START  paper-based payments: cash, personal checks, money orders, government checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  card-based payments: credit cards, charge cards, debit cards, deferred debit cards, ATM cards, prepaid cards, private label cards and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  eCommerce payments: electronic payments through desktop and laptop computers, tablets and other devices with web browsing capabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mobile payments: electronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications such as text messages, mobile billing, web browsers or applications, contactless readers, and other means; and ##TABLE_END 5 ##TABLE_START  other electronic payments: wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house payments and other forms of electronic payment not typically tied to a payment card or similar access device. ##TABLE_END The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose cards, which offer widespread merchant acceptance. General purpose cards are typically categorized as: ##TABLE_START  pay now cards, such as debit cards, which enable the cardholder to purchase goods and services by an automatic debit to a checking, demand deposit or other account with accessible funds; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay later cards, such as credit, deferred debit and charge cards, which typically permit a cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit or deferred debit account or require payment of the full balance within a specified period; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay before cards, such as prepaid cards, which are pre-funded up to a certain monetary value. ##TABLE_END Primary card brands include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, and Discover/Diners Club. While these brands, including Visa, were historically associated with consumer credit or charge cards in the United States and other major international markets, we and others have, over time, broadened our offerings to include debit, ATM, prepaid and commercial payment products. Our Core Operations We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume, transactions that we process and other related services we provide. Our clients deliver Visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on product platforms we define and manage. Payments network management is a core part of our operations, as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe, efficient, consistent and interoperable service to cardholders, merchants and financial institutions worldwide.  Transaction Processing Services Processing Infrastructure We own and operate VisaNet, which consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the United States. In addition, Visa Europe, which is under separate ownership, operates processing centers in the United Kingdom. These are part of our synchronized system, in accordance with the terms of our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. These centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. Intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added information, including information products, such as risk scoring and loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our system. Visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the United States and internationally, including those we added with our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan. These secure facilities allow for high availability transaction services and connectivity to the Internet, clients and processing partners. Core Processing Services Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between Visa issuers and acquirers. In addition, we offer a range of value-added processing services to support our clients' Visa programs and to promote the growth and security of our payments network. Authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed. Clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder's account, the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction, and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies. Settlement is the process of calculating, determining, reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared. The issuer and acquirer involved in a typical Visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor. For example, the acquirer credits the merchant's account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer. In addition, the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment, in the case of a credit or deferred debit card, or collects payment directly from the cardholder's deposit account, in the case of a debit card. We process most Visa transactions occurring in the United States. We also process most Visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries, which we refer to as cross-border transactions. In countries outside the United States, processing of domestic Visa transactions varies. In some countries, such as Canada and Brazil, Visa processes the majority of transactions. In many other countries, transactions may be processed outside of our systems, generally by government-controlled payments networks, our clients, independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients. We perform clearing and settlement through VisaNet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in Visa Europe's region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world, or vice versa. Visa Europe authorizes, clears and settles transactions for its members through its own processing system. Other Value-Added Processing Services We offer a range of other value-added services in certain countries, including risk management, issuer processing, loyalty, dispute management, value-added information and CyberSource-branded services. Risk Management Services . We provide clients in certain countries with a number of value-added risk-management services. These services, including Visa Advanced Authorization, provide preventive, monitoring, investigative and predictive tools, which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level. Issuer Processing Services. Visa Debit Processing Services, or DPS, provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating U.S. issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. In addition to core issuer authorization processing, DPS offers card management services, exception processing, PIN and ATM network gateways, call center services, fraud detection services and ATM terminal driving. Visa Processing Service, or VPS, provides credit, debit and prepaid issuer processing services, including multi-currency processing functionality, outside the United States. Loyalty Services . We offer loyalty services, which allow our clients to differentiate their Visa program offerings, enhance the attractiveness of their Visa payment programs and strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants. Dispute Management Services . We manage Visa Resolve Online, an automated web-based service that allows our clients' back-office analysts and client service representatives to manage and resolve Visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with paper-based processes. Value-Added Information Services . We provide our clients with a range of additional information-based business analytics and applications, as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them. CyberSource-branded services . We provide technology and services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud, and safeguard payment security online. CyberSource brings these payment management solutions to market on two platforms: CyberSource Enterprise services, targeting medium and large-sized enterprise businesses; and Authorize.Net, targeting smaller businesses with less than $3 million in annual online sales.  Product Platforms We offer a broad range of product platforms that enable our clients to build differentiated, competitive payment programs for their consumer, business, government and merchant clients. Our principal payment platforms enable credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs, as well as virtual, mobile and eCommerce payments for consumers, businesses and government entities. Our payment platforms are offered under our Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Consumer Credit Our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments. Our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as Visa Classic or Visa Traditional. In addition, we offer a range of premium credit platforms that enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits, such as loyalty programs. Our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers, and in some cases, to cardholders, as Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Signature Preferred and Visa Infinite. Consumer Deposit Access Our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw on consumers' deposit accounts, such as checking, demand deposit or other pre-funded accounts. Consumer Debit . Our primary consumer debit platform in the United States and many other countries uses the Visa brand mark. Depending on local marketplace point of sale practices, Visa Debit transactions can be authenticated by a cardholder's signature, or no signature if the transaction is for a small purchase amount, or by personal identification number, or PIN, or other means of authentication. In the United States, in addition to the Visa debit product, we also provide the Interlink debit product platform. Interlink is a PIN-always, single message platform generally for U.S. domestic transactions. U.S. issuers can choose to enable Interlink as a PIN network on a Visa debit card, and U.S. merchants can choose Interlink as a PIN-always point of sale acceptance option. Additionally, Interlink can remain as a routing alternative on both Visa and non-Visa branded debit cards. Our clients in Asia Pacific, or AP, Latin America and Caribbean, or LAC, and Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or CEMEA, can use the Visa Electron debit platform, which requires all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically. It is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher-risk client segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less prevalent. Prepaid. Our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. Our prepaid platform includes general purpose reloadable, gift, travel, youth, payroll, money transfer, corporate incentive, insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards. Cash Access. Our clients can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at Visa and PLUS branded ATMs. Most Visa and Visa Electron branded cards offer cash access at ATMs, as well as at branches of our participating financial institution clients. The PLUS brand may also be included on issuers' non-Visa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services. Commercial Our commercial product platforms enable small businesses, medium and large companies, and government organizations to streamline payment processes, manage total spend, access information reporting, automate their supply chain and reduce administrative costs. Small Businesses . We provide tools and resources to small business owners to help them securely manage payments and receivables through our debit, credit and acceptance solutions. Visa Business Electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside North America. Large and Medium Companies. The Visa Corporate platform offers payment options for business-to-business and employee travel and entertainment charges, including cash advances, providing detailed transaction data as well as information and expense management tools. The Visa Purchasing platform provides card and non-card electronic payment products that allow companies to easily procure goods and services, while streamlining resource- and paper-intensive purchase order and invoice processing. Through Syncada, our joint venture with US Bank, we market an integrated invoice processing, payment and financing platform for financial institutions to offer to their corporate and government commercial clients around the world. Government Organizations. In addition to the products mentioned above, we offer government organizations unique information- and expense-management tools, employee-fraud and misuse-management tools and strategic sourcing tools for their card programs. In certain countries, we offer specialized commercial products for specific government-sponsored programs, typically targeting agriculture, small-business, freight or construction loan programs. Product Platform Innovation Our fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms, enabling more Visa transactions in every channel, and extending the utility of our products and services to access points, such as eCommerce and mobile, and new merchant segments and geographies. We invest in innovation, because we believe we can drive more secure, accessible and versatile payment program options for clients, merchants and consumers. We focus on new payment channels, payment technologies, payment account access devices and authentication methods. We have recently made significant investments in the development of eCommerce and mobile payment platforms, contact and contactless chip cards and devices, card product enhancements, authentication and security technologies and platforms; and money transfer. We have the following initiatives: ##TABLE_START  Acquisitions.  Our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are allowing us to execute our innovation strategy. For example, CyberSource is helping drive eCommerce internationally, PlaySpan has accelerated our participation in the fast-growing digital goods space, and Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan Government to drive access to financial services for consumers in that country. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Partnerships. In mature markets, we have licensed our mobile NFC payment technology to third-party wallet providers to help ensure their solutions are enabled with Visa payment functionality. In addition, we have signed agreements with several mobile operators to extend payment functionality to mobile subscribers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Product Innovations: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  V.me by Visa: We have developed our new digital wallet service, V.me, to enhance the ease of use for consumers and merchants in online payments. V.me is available in beta for consumer enrollment and online merchant checkout in the United States, and the V.me acceptance mark is now visible on more than twenty merchant sites. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa payWave: We have certified NFC-enabled smartphones from device manufacturers for use with our mobile payment application, Visa payWave. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Mobile Provisioning Services: We have developed a new service that enables banks and operators to securely provision mobile payment accounts on NFC-enabled smartphones. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Mobile Prepaid: We have introduced a new product based on Fundamo technology, bringing Visa-quality payments to unbanked consumers in developing markets. ##TABLE_END Payments Network Management We devote significant resources to ensuring that Visa is the payments network of choice for clients, merchants and cardholders. We seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities, educating domestic and regulatory banking authorities on our capabilities, increasing acceptance of Visa products around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants. Brand Management, Marketing and Corporate Reputation We engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, taking a targeted, analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives. We combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, public relations and, increasingly, social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand, promote product usage, increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention. For merchants, we work to ensure that the Visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment, as well as a way to increase sales. For our issuer clients, our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. Sponsorship is a specific area where we have invested in developing global marketing relationships to promote the Visa brand. For instance, we have been the exclusive payment services sponsor for the Olympic Games since 1986 and have extended that sponsorship through 2020. We are also one of six FIFA partners providing us with worldwide exclusive access to the FIFA World Cup and more than 40 other FIFA competitions. These sponsorships create a powerful opportunity to drive business, achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift, global reach and local relevance. In addition, we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional, national and local companies, sports leagues and events, such as the National Football League in the United States, and with associations and companies, to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions. Our client and merchant marketing activities bring added value through the development of marketing programs designed to drive their specific business objectives. For merchant clients, these programs generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions. For issuer clients, our marketing programs support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. In addition, we work on various fronts to maintain, enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand. Our Corporate Responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities. We do so by expanding financial inclusion and literacy, providing humanitarian aid and community support, and engaging in responsible business practices. We continue to promote an understanding of Visa's role as a payments network and articulate the ways that electronic payments can advance economic empowerment, remove friction from commerce and increase government efficiencies. To that end, Currency of Progress, our corporate reputation campaign launched in October 2009, communicates the tangible benefits that Visa and electronic payments deliver to individuals, businesses, governments and economies. Merchant Acceptance Initiatives We aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fast-growing segments, such as bill payment. Our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations, delivering value-added information services, and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment. For example, we raised the limit for our no signature required program from $25 to $50 for U.S. discount stores and grocery stores/supermarkets, enabling more face-to-face merchants to accept Visa cards for transactions without requiring a cardholder signature, PIN or providing a receipt unless requested by the cardholder. This program can increase speed at the point of sale, enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants. We also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our products. Client Standards Rulemaking and Enforcement. In general, our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems. Our clients are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with, and in certain cases non-equity membership interests in, our subsidiaries. These rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks; the standards, design and features of payment cards, devices and programs; processing; merchant acquiring activities, including use of agents; disputes between members; risk management; settlement indemnification; client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients. We establish and administer dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions. For example, after a transaction is presented to an issuer, the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons, including fraud. If the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction, the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer, an action termed a chargeback. We enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes. Credit Risk Management. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. We have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years. See Item 1ARisk FactorsWe risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications.  To manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations, we established a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures. We regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk. In certain instances, we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees. If a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss. We may also apply other risk control measures, such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions, limiting the use of certain types of agents, prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high-risk merchants or suspending or terminating a client's rights to participate in our payments network. The exposure to settlement losses through our indemnification is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model, which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). See Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management elsewhere in this report. Payment System Integrity The integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products. Fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or card-not-present transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems not associated with VisaNet that store, process or transmit cardholder or account data, including systems operated by merchants, financial institutions and other third-party data processors. Our fraud detection and prevention offerings include: ##TABLE_START  Verified by Visa, a global Internet authentication product, which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Advanced Authorization, which provides enhanced fraud detection capability by adding real-time risk scores to authorization messages; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Chip technologies, embedded microprocessors that provide enhanced security and reduce the incidence of counterfeit card fraud. As a result, Visa has created incentives for merchants and issuers to adopt them, including in the United States. Chip technologies can also carry other applications that enhance the consumer payment experience; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CyberSource's Decision Manager solution, which provides access to over 200 validation tests to assess the legitimacy of card-not-present orders. ##TABLE_END We work with all participants in the payment system to ensure that any entity that transmits, processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders. For example, we mandate protection of PIN data through use of the Triple Data Encryption Standard and work with the payments industry to manage the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). There has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of PCI DSS, with more than 97% percent of the largest U.S. merchants validating compliance annually. Government Regulation General . Government regulation affects key aspects of our business. Our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and consequently such regulations have the potential to affect our business indirectly. In recent years, our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. See Item 1ARisk FactorsIncreased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues . The Dodd-Frank Act . As noted, during the 2011 fiscal year, the U.S. Federal Reserve established new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act affecting interchange reimbursement fees, network exclusivity and transaction routing. We expect these rules, which include provisions effective in our fiscal 2012 and 2013, to continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process and decrease associated revenues. See Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business  and  Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview. We have significantly modified our debit strategy as a result. See  Overview . Interchange Reimbursement Fees. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the United States and many other geographies. The new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act set the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying a fraud adjustment of up to an additional one cent. This amounts to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. See Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business ; and  Item 1ARisk FactorsAdditional regulation of interchange reimbursement fees may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . The United States is not the only jurisdiction to regulate debit interchange reimbursement fees. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia has enacted a regulation limiting the costs that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fees for both our credit and our debit cards. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated from products in our payments system. We generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value. They promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other. By establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands, we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the Visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and, ultimately, consumers and merchants. We believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers, merchants, our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment, and by creating incentives for innovation, enhanced data quality and security. Merchants do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fees. A merchant's cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate. The merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in open-loop payments networks, including those relating to interchange, and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants. Merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers, other payment card systems and other forms of payment. We do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers. In some cases, such as India, the governing authorities have regulated the merchant discount rate itself, rather than the interchange reimbursement fee. Network Exclusivity and Routing. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, issuers of some debit products outside the United States have historically chosen to include only the Visa network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. The Dodd-Frank Act limits our and issuers' ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See Item 1A The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As another example, the Canadian Ministry of Finance has implemented a voluntary Code of Conduct for payment card industry participants, with which Visa has agreed to comply. Among other things, the Code of Conduct prohibits certain restrictions on merchants' choice of payment options they will accept. See Item 1ARisk FactorsAdditional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The bureau's future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating the industry. No-Surcharge Rules. We have historically implemented policies that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa instead of other means. Some local jurisdictions have taken steps to limit these no-surcharge rules. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia enacted a regulation that prohibited us from enforcing our no-surcharge policy and effectively allowed merchants to impose discretionary surcharges on Visa transactions without limitation. Recently, the Reserve Bank of Australia, while reinforcing its position that surcharging is appropriate in that market, has taken steps that would allow us to limit the level of surcharges that merchants can impose. Additionally, in the United States there are ten states that prohibit the use of the surcharge as an anti-consumer practice through their state legislatures. Data Protection and Information Security. We devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with U.S. federal and state and foreign regulations safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institution Examination Council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the United States to examine our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctioned Countries. In response to U.S. and other regulations, we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine a program to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. We also prohibit from being Visa members all financial institutions that are domiciled in countries sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controlcurrently Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan. In addition, we refrain from any financial dealings with restricted third parties, such as identified money-laundering fronts for terrorists and narcotics traffickers. Government-Imposed Market Participation Influences and Restrictions. Our business's reach remains limited by certain governments' influence on domestic payments competition and/or protection of domestic payment card providers or payment processing providers. Most notably, none of our financial institution clients in China have received authorization to issue cards carrying only our brands for domestic use in China, limiting our opportunities in that market. Regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world, including recently Thailand, Ukraine, the UAE, Mexico, Colombia and Russia, have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries. Regulation of Internet Transactions . Many jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulations and taxes on Internet transactions. Most notably, we have had to implement compliance programs in response to new U.S. regulations requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions. In addition, the U.S. Congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our clients. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would affect our clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our clients' ability to extend credit by using payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients' ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We own numerous valuable trademarks and designs, covering various brands, products, programs and services, which are essential to our business in multiple countries, including, but not limited to Visa, Interlink, PLUS, Visa Electron, the Winged V design, and the Dove design. Through agreements with our clients, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment, including paper-based forms, principally cash and checks; card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited-use cards; eCommerce and mobile-based platforms and other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automatic clearing house, or ACH, payments and electronic data interchange. Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants. The leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Diners Club. Other general purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. In certain countries, our competitors have leading positions, such as UnionPay in China, which remains the sole domestic inter-bank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in China. We also compete against private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other merchant. In the debit card market segment, Visa and MasterCard are the primary global brands. In addition, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands including STAR, NYCE, and PULSE in the United States, EFTPOS in Australia, NETS in Singapore, and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the online debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands are the primary brands, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume. As the payments landscape evolves, we may increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional bank-centric business model. The emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal, Google and Isis are examples. These providers compete with Visa directly in some cases, yet may also be significant partners and customers of Visa.  Based on payments volume, total volume and number of transactions, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2011: ##TABLE_START Company  Payments Volume  Total Volume  Total Transactions  Cards   (billions)  (billions)  (billions)  (millions) Visa Inc.

Visa figures represent total volume, payments volume and cash volume, and the number of payments transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards for products carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Card counts include PLUS proprietary cards. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume. The data presented is reported quarterly by Visa's clients on their operating certificates and is subject to verification by Visa.

Working Capital Requirements Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily working capital requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Seasonality We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 accounted for more than 30% of our fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 operating revenues. Employees At September 30, 2012 , we employed approximately 8,500 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Additional Information and SEC Reports Visa Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to our reorganization, Visa operated as five corporate entities related by ownership and membership, each of which operated as a separate geographic region. As a result of the reorganization, all except Visa Europe became subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. in connection with the reorganization. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, in March 2008.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement fees may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours. In connection with transactions initiated with products in our payments system, interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuersthe financial institutions that issue Visa cards to cardholders. The fees are typically paid by acquirersthe financial institutions that offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants. We refer to a system like ours, in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer, as an open-loop system. We generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the United States and many other geographies. However, in certain jurisdictions, interchange rates and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area in the United States. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . In addition, interchange rates have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates. These jurisdictions include Australia, Canada, Brazil and South Africa. When we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers find our payments system less attractive. This lowers overall transaction volume and slows growth of transactions. It also may increase the attractiveness of closed-loop payments systemsthose with direct connections to both merchants and consumersand other forms of payment. In addition, we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers. In some instances, this makes our card programs less desirable and reduces our transaction volumes and profitability. Some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the level of Visa interchange, leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer Visa cardholders to alternate payment systems. In addition, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs. For these reasons, additional regulation of interchange reimbursement fees may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . In order to give Visa-branded cardholders a consistent experience, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only the Visa network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, Visa's rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through VisaNet and that a member must clear international transactions through VisaNet. These are commonly referred to as routing rules. The Dodd-Frank Act already limits our and issuers' ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Future regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process. In order to retain that transaction volume, we would have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants. Any of these eventualities could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange fee charged by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. These regulations have adversely affected our U.S. debit business and associated revenues. They created negative pressure on our pricing, reduced the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminished associated revenues, and, although we believe we have now absorbed their principal impact, they could continue to do so. These pressures have arisen through various channels. A number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some reduced the number of debit cards they issue and investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. Many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. Other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. Although the bureau's future actions may benefit consumers, these actions may also make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit, and prepaid. Some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the regulation. Our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategies less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, the regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act could continue to have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. New regulations or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products . Regulators around the world increasingly note each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Dodd-Frank Act is one development with such potential. Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product. For example, regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit. As a result, the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment. These include matters like interchange reimbursement fees, network exclusivity, preferred routing, dynamic currency conversion, point of sale transaction rules and practices, and operating regulations. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our products, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues . Governments in some countries provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks, brands and processing providers. These governments may take this action in order to support these providers. They may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries, to force us to leave, or to restrict substantially our activities there. For example, the government of China continues to maintain regulations that substantially favor China Union Pay, the only retail payments network currently operating in the Chinese domestic market. Additionally, governments in some countries may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country. This would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients. Our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands. Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued, our payments volume and our revenues . Recently, privacy, data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach. These measures may increase our and our clients' costs. They may also decrease the number of Visa-branded cards our clients issue. This would materially and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. Increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues . Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Similarly, the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards. Any of these occurrences can materially and adversely affect our business, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations. Examples include: ##TABLE_START  Data Protection and Information Security . Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing . The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions require us to maint a in an anti-money laundering program. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, restrict us from dealing with certain countries and parties considered to be connected with money laundering, terrorism or narcotics. Non-U.S. Visa International members may not be similarly restricted, so in some cases third parties could try to use our payments system for transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions. We have controls in place designed to ensure OFAC compliance, but if those controls should fail, we could be subject to penalties, reputational damage and loss of business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation of the Price of Credit . Many jurisdictions in which our cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act in the United States and proposed regulations under it. They also include proposed changes to the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which, if implemented along with regulations required to be promulgated under the Credit CARD Act, could result in a decrease in our payments volume and revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Increased Central Bank Oversight. Several central banks around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the retail electronic payments industry, in some cases designating them as systemically important payment systems. Such oversight may lead to additional regulations. These could include new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Safety and Soundness Regulation . Recent banking regulations enacted in the United States and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less attracted to becoming an issuer of our cards, because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation of Internet Transactions . Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using our cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the law that governs them, their taxation or the allocation of intellectual property rights. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Money Transfer Regulations. As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. state money transfer regulations, increasing regulatory oversight and costs of compliance. ##TABLE_END Litigation Risks Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments.  Our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation, which is described in Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings). They also include a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement. In addition, our U.S. members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated, and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or, in certain circumstances, even cause us to become insolvent. The principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fees. Since 2005, approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain financial institutions that issue Visa-branded payment cards and acquire Visa-branded payment transactions in the U.S. We refer to this as the interchange litigation. Among other antitrust allegations, the plaintiffs have alleged that Visa's setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuits were transferred to a multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages will be trebled. The allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan. The Company's litigation escrow account currently contains an amount that covers our exposure in the interchange litigation as negotiated with the class plaintiffs. On October 19, 2012, we signed settlement agreements in these cases, including an agreement to pay approximately $4 billion to the class plaintiffs. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs on November 9, 2012. However, the agreement with the class plaintiffs remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals. We cannot assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeals. Failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent. The retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation. The plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre-trial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation. See  If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages. In addition, non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business. See  Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Therefore, even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of, and judgments in, the covered litigation, it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of all litigation. If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages.  Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition/antitrust law, consumer protection law, or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. Private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us. This is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers, due to the size and scope of our business. If we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit, such as the United States or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be significant. See Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages. This could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial conditions and could even cause us to become insolvent. Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. We may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation. For example, in the pending settlement agreement in the interchange litigation, we have agreed, among other things, to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions under certain circumstances. These and other settlements of, or judgments in, past, pending and future litigation could force us to limit further the fees we charge, to revise further our rules about fees charged to consumers who choose to pay with Visa, or to make other modifications to our business. These modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume, revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws applicable to us, could materially increase our tax payments.  We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 20Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Our agreement with Visa Europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities.  Under our framework agreement with Visa Europe, we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions giving rise to such claims. Such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. Business Risks The intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits.  We offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand our card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing support payments and other support. Over the past several years, we have increased the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the United States. In order to stay competitive, we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Dodd-Frank Act have increased this pressure. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . This pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks, presenting the potential for the same adverse effects. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. Finally, increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, and we may not succeed in these efforts. Intense competition in our industry may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth to suffer.  The global payments industry is intensely competitive. Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks, and electronic and mobile transactions. In addition, our payment programs compete against the card-based payments systems of our competitors and private-label cards issued by merchants. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased this competitive pressure. Some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services than we do, including more innovative ones. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do. They may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. These include domestic networks in the United States, China, Canada, Australia, and other countries and regions. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. Traditional or untraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients' long-term commitments to our products has increased with the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. Most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive. These include those with our largest clients: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships, sometimes on relatively short notice, and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 14Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternative types of payment services, such as mobile payments services, online payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business.  Our position in the payments value chain underpins our business. Certain of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternative payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. The Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory actions have provided and may in the future provide them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although they pursue the same or similar lines of business using the same or similar business and commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients, materially and adversely affecting our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth  In the recent past, the banking industry experienced substantial, accelerated consolidation. This could happen again. Significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors. This could result in the acquired bank's Visa business shifting to that competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. In addition, one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors, shifting its payments volume to that competitor. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients. This consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us. In addition, more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Merchants' continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation, regulation, regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements.  We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation. If they continue, these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. We and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants. This could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives. Certain financial institutions have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.  Certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues. In addition, these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Failure to maintain relationships with our clients, merchant acquirers, merchants and vendors, and the failure of clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business.  We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates, if any, or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features. With the exception of several large merchants, historically, we have generally not solicited merchants directly to accept our cards. As a result, the success of our business has depended significantly on, and will continue to depend on, the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them. In the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to rules on network exclusivity, we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants and merchant acquirers and processors. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with the merchant, who directly receives incentive funding. We also engage with merchants and merchant acquirers and processors to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth. As these and other relationships take on a greater importance for both merchants and us, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In many countries outside the United States, our clients or other processors authorize, clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems. This pattern is increasing with a rise in new systems endorsed by governments. In addition, we historically have not generally had direct relationships with merchants there, and shifting technology and development may further increase such activity. We do not have direct relationships with cardholders. Consequently, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards. Our inability to control the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf, and to the extent that third-party vendors fail to deliver services, our business and reputation could be impaired. The perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation, which are key assets of our business.  Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry. Our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands. From time to time, our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge, which may materially and adversely affect our business. Further, Visa Europe has very broad latitude to operate the Visa business in and use our brands and technology within Visa Europe's region, in which we have only limited control over the operation of the Visa business. Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the Visa brands in its region, and the strength of the Visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of Visa Europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in Europe. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny. Finally, because we are domiciled in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business.  Unprecedented economic events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world. These include decreased consumer spending; increased unemployment; deflation; increased savings; decreased consumer debt; excess housing inventory; lowered government spending; decreased export activity; continued challenges in the credit environment; continued equity market volatility; additional government intervention; bank instability; downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt; political issues affecting the handling of national debt; and the uncertainty arising from new government policies. This economic turmoil has affected the economies of Europe, the United States and other mature economies in particular. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise. These include defaults on government debt, exhaustion of U.S. and other national economic stimulus packages, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, a significant decline in the commercial real estate market, and policy missteps. Most recently, the economic situation in Europe has been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of a default by Greece, Portugal, Spain and other nations on their debt obligations. If such a default occurs, or if the measures taken to avert such a default create their own instability, economic turmoil is likely to result, and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant. In addition, the so-called fiscal cliff in the United Statesthe combination of expiring tax cuts and mandatory reductions in federal spending at the end of 2012has the potential to have an impact on the economy and the stock market. The severity of the economic environment and the response by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones. These include the following: ##TABLE_START  Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease cardholder spending. ##TABLE_END 23 ##TABLE_START  Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or additional expense reductions, which may reduce our revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, affecting our revenue and reducing cardholders' desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may increase cardholder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing our value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business with those institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The trading markets for U.S. government securities may be adversely affected by changes in investor sentiment. This could arise from a number of market forces, including, among others, the U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in its debt rating. This in turn could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are U.S. treasury and government securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage matters. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fee and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Declines in stock prices or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially. ##TABLE_END Some existing clients have been placed in receivership or under government administration. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential changes in laws and regulations. Many of our clients, merchants that accept our brands, and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, growth, revenue, profitability and overall business. A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions.  We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions, and our clients pay us fees in connection with them. Some of those fees differ when conversion from the merchant's currency to the cardholder's billing currency is required. Thus, revenue from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuates with cross-border activity and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency. In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients' settlement in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as result of regulation, litigation, competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, natural disasters, the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases. A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. A decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Moreover, if our clients decide to increase cardholder fees associated with cross-border transactions, there could be a decline in cardholder spending, since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. Transactions outside the United States represent an increasingly important part of our strategy. In order to continue to grow in those areas, we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the types of products we provide, the quality of our service and the viability of our brand. If we cannot employ our organizational resources effectively, we will be unable to do so. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications.  We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited, but restricted to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources, as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We estimate settlement at risk (or exposure) based on the sum of three inputs. The first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin. The second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume. The third is the total balance for outstanding traveler's cheques. Additionally, from time to time, we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary. See Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions. Some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services, the use of our products could decline, reducing our revenues and net income.  Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry. These include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile commerce, and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties' intellectual property rights. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently, the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  Our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism, climate change or accident. In addition, our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computer-based attacks. The latter could include computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. See Account data breaches involving card data stored by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues . If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Finally, potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs, both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability. Account data breaches involving card data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.  Our clients, merchants, others and we process, store or transmit cardholder account information in connection with Visa-branded payment cards. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. Breach of the systems processing, storing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, to reputational damage and to claims against us. If we are sued in connection with any material data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards, which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, any data security breach could result in additional regulation, which could materially increase our costs. An increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards.  Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information. They use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving the payment system. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards. A rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation, increasing our compliance costs. Failure to maintain interoperability between our and Visa Europe's authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands.  Visa Europe and we maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing, and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems. Failure to authorize or clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the Visa brands. Structural and Organizational Risks We have little ability to control Visa Europe's operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us.  Visa Europe has very broad rights to operate the Visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship. If we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for Visa Europe and its members, then Visa Europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that Visa Europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation. If Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations, our remedies under this agreement are limited. We cannot terminate the agreement even upon Visa Europe's material, uncured breach. Although we have a call right to acquire Visa Europe, we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances. These and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder. In some instances, as in the case of CyberSource and PlaySpan, Visa Europe may have the right to control the activities of newly acquired entities within Visa Europe's territory. In any event, Visa Europe's license rights in Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from Visa Europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in Visa Europe's region. If Visa Europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock, we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income.  We have granted Visa Europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised. We will incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more if Visa Europe exercises this option. Visa Europe may do so at any time. We may need to obtain third-party financing in order to meet our obligation, by either borrowing funds or selling stock. An equity offering, or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock, would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price. Sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. If Visa Europe exercises the put option, we may encounter difficulties in integrating Visa Europe's business and systems into our existing operations. If we cannot do so quickly and cost-effectively, the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management, disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we would become subject to the many regulations of the European Union that govern the operations of Visa Europe, including any regulatory disputes. We are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option. We record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations. Consequently, the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share. These quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant. The existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it. If we cannot remain organizationally effective, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive, economic and regulatory environment.  Since our reorganization in October 2007, we have increasingly centralized our management and operations. For us to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization, and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, the current competitive, economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges. We may not be able to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough, define our appetite for risk specifically enough, execute our strategy seamlessly enough, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes efficiently enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough. We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees.  Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business. Acquisitions, strategic investments and entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. The integration of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, all acquired recently, will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions. We will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the Visa Europe territory. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management's time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues. Moreover, our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments. With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisition or through organic development. These include electronic and mobile payments. Relative inexperience in such businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B stock, could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class A common stock, adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class A common stock.  The market price and voting power of our class A common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding. The market price of our class A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur, such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class A common stock. Specifically, upon the final resolution of our covered litigation, all class B stock will become transferable at once. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted.  Under our retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class B common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class A common stock, benefiting the holders of class B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest in Visa Inc. held by the holders of class A common stock. In this case, the amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution. Holders of our shares of our class B and C common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions, and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class A common stock.  Although their voting rights are limited, holders of shares of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control.  Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock, shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5% of our total outstanding shares on an as-converted basis. Our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.  Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. Any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. However, sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends. Payment of future dividends, if any, would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If, because of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock. Furthermore, no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock, unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class of common stock. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding class A, B and C common stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report . Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services we provide. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2012 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. The Dodd-Frank Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide interchange fees charged before the Dodd-Frank Act was implemented. The Federal Reserve has also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. The interchange, exclusivity and routing regulations have impacted our pricing, reduced the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process and decreased associated revenues. A number of our clients have sought fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have reduced the number of debit cards they issue and reduced investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some have imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand-deposit account relationships. Some have elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. Additionally, the routing regulations have allowed merchants to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We have had to re-examine and renegotiate certain of our client contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations and will continue to do so with others. As a result, our clients have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers' debit cards. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent by making pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. For fiscal 2012, the overall net impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, including restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, was a decrease of approximately $0.15 in diluted earnings per class A common share. Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Dodd-Frank Act and mitigate some of its negative impacts. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. Notice of Proposed Adjustment. On May 23, 2012, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) to our fiscal 2008 U.S. federal income tax return seeking to disallow the deduction of settlement payments associated with the American Express litigation made during that fiscal year. However, on August 15, 2012, the IRS issued a Chief Counsel Advice (CCA), supporting our position that Visa is entitled to the deduction, and subsequently the IRS issued a revised Revenue Agent Report (RAR) effectively withdrawing the NOPA. The IRS may still challenge any income tax return position taken, including the deductibility of covered litigation payments made in fiscal 2008 or any future year, until the statute of limitations has closed for each applicable year. The statute of limitations for fiscal 2008 is expected to expire in June of 2013. However, given the CCA and revised RAR, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years. Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL) . On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange MDL. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the MDL for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. The settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval, which we cannot assure will be received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Reversal of tax reserves. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange MDL, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deferred tax adjustment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. The reduction in the fair value of the put option was the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. ##TABLE_END The following table presents our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2012   Fiscal 2011  (in millions, except margin ratio and per share data)  Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1)  Net Income Attributable to Visa Inc.

Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2012 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion, $710 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. In July 2012 , our board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013 . As of September 30, 2012, the program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million . In October 2012 , our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013 . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and processed transactions are the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume increased as a result of continuing double-digit percentage growth in consumer credit and commercial payments volume worldwide. These increases were moderated by an anticipated deceleration in consumer debit growth, primarily due to the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Excluding U.S. debit transactions, which reflect the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate, reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency. The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars (1) . ##TABLE_START  U.S.  Rest of World   Visa Inc.  12 months ended June 30, 2012 (2)  12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)   % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2012 (2)  12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)  % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2012 (2)   12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)  % Change   (in billions, except percentages) Nominal Payments Volume                  Consumer credit $  $  %  $ 1,370  $ 1,188  %  $ 2,081  $ 1,829  % Consumer debit (3) 1,045  1,037  %    %  1,378  1,302  % Commercial and other (3)   %    %    % Total Nominal Payments Volume $ 2,066  $ 1,961  %  $ 1,833  $ 1,569  %  $ 3,899  $ 3,530  % Cash volume   %  1,921  1,704  %  2,351  2,108  % Total Nominal Volume (4) $ 2,496  $ 2,364  %  $ 3,753  $ 3,273  %  $ 6,250  $ 5,638  % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  U.S.  Rest of World  Visa Inc.  12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)  12 months ended June 30, 2010 (2)  % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)  12 months ended June 30, 2010 (2)  % Change   12 months ended June 30, 2011 (2)  12 months ended June 30, 2010 (2)  % Change   (in billions, except percentages) Nominal Payments Volume                  Consumer credit $  $  %  $ 1,188  $  %  $ 1,829  $ 1,586  % Consumer debit (3) 1,037   %    %  1,302  1,107  % Commercial and other (3)   %    %    % Total Nominal Payments Volume $ 1,961  $ 1,752  %  $ 1,569  $ 1,285  %  $ 3,530  $ 3,037  % Cash volume   %  1,704  1,411  %  2,108  1,785  % Total Nominal Volume (4) $ 2,364  $ 2,125  %  $ 3,273  $ 2,696  %  $ 5,638  $ 4,821  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. ##TABLE_END The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented. ##TABLE_START     2012 vs. 2011 % Change (1)  2011 vs. 2010 % Change (1)  (in millions)     Visa processed transactions (2) 53,324  50,922  45,411  %  % CyberSource billable transactions (3) 5,182  4,137  3,032 (4)  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Since its July 2010 acquisition, CyberSource activity has primarily contributed to our data processing revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes CyberSource transactions prior to the July 2010 acquisition. ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our payment processing platforms. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining the interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance by the issuing bank, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver Visa products and payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway and PlaySpan's virtual goods payment platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for processing cross-border transactions, and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the cardholder's issuer country is different from the merchant's country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist primarily of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and certain activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services.  Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest income (expense) primarily includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Investment income represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other investments. Other non-operating income primarily relates to gains and losses earned on equity method investments and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 5,720  $ 5,135  $ 4,718  $  $  %  % Rest of world 4,478  3,846  3,137    %  % Visa Europe     (3 )  %  (1 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 10,421  $ 9,188  $ 8,065  $ 1,233  $ 1,123  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the U.S. during fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect low double-digit percentage growth in our operating revenues for the full 2013 fiscal year. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. There was no significant impact on the year-over-year growth for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , as the effect of exchange rate movements was substantially mitigated through our hedging program. We expect the impacts of our hedging program to continue to minimize the effect of exchange rate movements during fiscal 2013 . See Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 4,872  $ 4,261  $ 3,497  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 3,975  3,478  3,125    %  % International transaction revenues 3,025  2,674  2,290    %  % Other revenues     (58 )  %  (8 )% Client incentives (2,155 )  (1,880 )  (1,560 )  (275 )  (320 )  %  % Total Operating Revenues $ 10,421  $ 9,188  $ 8,065  $ 1,233  $ 1,123  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Service revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to 10% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in geography-specific pricing. Service revenues  increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume combined with benefits from competitive pricing actions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent through pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. This price restructuring included the implementation of the Fixed Acquirer Network Fee, which was partially offset by reductions in certain variable fees. While data processing fees benefited from the price restructuring that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 , increased merchant and acquirer incentives executed as part of this strategy resulted in higher client incentive levels, which partially offset this increase. ##TABLE_END Data processing revenues for fiscal 2012 also benefited from overall growth in processed transactions of 5% , which reflected an anticipated decline in U.S. debit transactions processed as a result of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The deceleration in processed transaction growth was led by Interlink, one of our lowest yielding products in the U.S., which decreased 51% in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the same prior year period. This negative impact was more than offset by solid growth in CyberSource billable transactions, Visa transactions processed outside of the U.S., U.S. credit transactions and Visa Debit transactions, which exclude Interlink. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource. This growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts and a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of a gross basis. ##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 primarily reflecting 11% and 18% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth. Other revenues  decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of a gross basis, and as a result of a large issuer that converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decrease was partially offset by increases in license fees and the inclusion of revenue from our acquired entities. ##TABLE_END 40 ##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2012 reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2012 , including a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Client incentives also increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume and certain one-time incentives incurred outside the U.S. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% for the full 2013 fiscal year. ##TABLE_END Increases in client incentives during fiscal 2011 reflected growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011 . Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,726  $ 1,459  $ 1,222  $  $  %  % Network and processing     (68 )  %  (16 )% Marketing     (94 )   %  (10 )% Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative      %  % Litigation provision 4,100   (45 )  4,093   NM  NM Total Operating Expenses (2) $ 8,282  $ 3,732  $ 3,476  $ 4,550  $  NM  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excluding the litigation provision of $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012, associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year on an adjusted basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in headcount throughout the organization combined with higher employee incentive-related costs. The increase also reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. The increases in headcount reflect our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly outside the U.S., in support of our core business, as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher fees paid for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2011 reflects the change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of on a gross basis. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. ##TABLE_START  Marketing remained flat in fiscal 2012 despite an increase in spending to support new product initiatives and our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2013, including incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies and new product initiatives. ##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of on a gross basis, combined with the impact of a large issuer converting away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. ##TABLE_START  Professional fees increased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 , primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects to support our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2012 , primarily due to additional depreciation expense from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  General and administrative increased primarily due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary asset and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. ##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_START  Litigation provision in fiscal 2012 reflects a $4.1 billion accrual related to litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers litigation settlement, combined with the release of accruals for certain other legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. See Note 2Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Interest income (expense) $  $ (32 )  $ (72 )  $  $  NM  (55 )% Investment income    (72 )   (67 )%  NM Other    (121 )   (98 )%  % Total Other Income (Expense) $  $  $  $ (132 )  $  (66 )%  NM ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interest income for fiscal 2012 reflects the reversal of previously accrued interest associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 reflects lower interest accretion due to declining litigation balances as well as the reversal of previously accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. See Note 20Income Taxes and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Investment income includes pre-tax gains of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Solues e Servios, or CBSS, and $20 million ##TABLE_END 42 recognized in fiscal 2010 related to our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. ##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income primarily reflects non-cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 is lower than the effective income tax rate of 36% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, primarily due to the impact of the following in fiscal 2012: ##TABLE_START  the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a decrease in our overall state tax rate due to changes in the California apportionment rules and the associated one-time, non-cash benefit of $208 million from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the $11 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our 2007 reorganization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a one-time benefit recognized upon initial recognition of foreign tax credits; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the foregoing adjustments to a pre-tax income that was reduced by a $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option. ##TABLE_END We expect our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate to increase to a more normalized range of 30% to 32%. Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_START  Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate  (in millions, except for percentages) As reported $ 2,207  $  % Reversal of tax reserves (43 )    Litigation provision 4,098  1,505   Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities     Adjusted $ 6,262  $ 2,061  % ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END 43 ##TABLE_START  optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:  ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 5,009  $ 3,872  $ 2,691 Investing activities (2,414 )  (2,299 )  (1,904 ) Financing activities (2,655 )  (3,304 )  (1,542 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  (9 )  Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (53 )  $ (1,740 )  $ (750 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to prior year, primarily reflecting higher operating revenue in fiscal 2012 . We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 , primarily reflecting continued growth in our net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers' litigation obligation in fiscal 2010. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Comparatively, cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 primarily included $1.8 billion for the acquisition of CyberSource. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 15Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Funds held by our foreign subsidiaries include cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, both short and long-term. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of $2.6 billion , which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.3 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1ARisk Factors. Revolving credit facilities. In February 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. We are in the process of replacing this facility in fiscal 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2012 . U.S. commercial paper program . We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2012 . There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires in July 2015. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2012 , was $4.4 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2012 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2012, we often did not need to fund settlement working capital as indicated by the fact that our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $43 million, although our greatest working capital requirement was a peak net settlement receivable balance of $587 million. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2012 , we made $140 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2012 the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $4.4 billion . In October 2012, we made an additional payment of $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  and Note 21Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2012 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion , $710 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. In July 2012, our board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013 . At September 30, 2012 , this share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million . In October 2012 , our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013 . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2012 , we paid $595 million in dividends. On October 24, 2012 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $221 million in connection with this dividend in December 2012. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the \"P/E ratio\" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the \"adjusted sustainable income\" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2012 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2012 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2012 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2012 , the spot P/E ratio was 18.8 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.8 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. ##TABLE_START  Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $100 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $100 million     (in millions)  (in millions)    $2,500  $625    $2,000  $500    $1,500  $375  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. ##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $88 million , $74 million , and $66 million , respectively. In fiscal 2013 , we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $52 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2012 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $425 million to $475 million range in fiscal 2013 , as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. Acquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2012 , compared to fiscal 2011 , when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. See Note 5Acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2012 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $9.8 billion of assets and $168 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $164 million , or less than 2%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September 30, 2012 , debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler's cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2012. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities, or the litigation escrow account. ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $  $  $  $   $ 1,043 Leases (2)     Client incentives (3) 2,537  3,509  2,025   8,653 Marketing and sponsorship (4)     Litigation settlement payments (5) 4,383        4,383 Dividends (6)        Total (7,8,9) $ 8,209  $ 4,017  $ 2,251  $  $ 15,354 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes both operating and capital leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future cash payments for incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements ##TABLE_END 48 represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements which we estimate we will record. ##TABLE_START (4)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings on October 19, 2012. The amount in the table represents the maximum amount expected to be paid out in fiscal 2013 under the class plaintiffs' settlement agreement and the individual plaintiffs' settlement agreement from the litigation escrow account. This amount includes the $350 million payment to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund made in October 2012. A litigation provision of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation was booked during fiscal 2012. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Includes expected dividend amount of $221 million as dividends were declared on October 24, 2012 and will be paid on December 4, 2012 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 16, 2012 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $139 million. At September 30, 2012, we also accrued $20 million of interest and $7 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2012 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements . ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2012 , client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value  Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2012 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program were $739 million and $651 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $739 million outstanding at September 30, 2012 , is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $40 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2012 . See Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2012 and 2011 were $3.0 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $42 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2012 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $923 million and $764 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2012 . We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risk Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $973 million and $783 million and projected benefit obligations were $990 million and $839 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2013 , which we expect to make in September 2013 . ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2012 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP San Francisco, California November 15, 2012  VISA INC.

VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2012 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\") and Inovant LLC (\"Inovant\") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the retrospective responsibility plan (\"the October 2007 reorganization\" or \"reorganization\"). See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks, VisaNet. The Company provides its clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, and facilitates global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. The Company is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Non-controlling interests are reported as a component of equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. The Companys activities are interrelated and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. See Note 21Legal Matters for a discussion of the covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in investment income, on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include cash equivalents (money market funds), U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and foreign exchange derivative instruments. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 assets include the Company's investments in auction rate securities. Level 3 liabilities include the Visa Europe put option and the earn-out related to the PlaySpan acquisition. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2011-04, which provides common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Company adopted ASU 2011-04 effective January 1, 2012. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in investment income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets, while those with stated maturities of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments, $3.3 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if (1) it has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. The Company recognized $4 million of OTTI for available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2012. The Company had no OTTI for available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2011 and 2010. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in the other line within the other income (expense) caption on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the historical cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, the Visa Europe put option and the earn-out provision related to the PlaySpan acquisition. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and payable on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from credit, debit and travelers cheque product clearings. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management . Client incentives. The Company enters into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payment network and CyberSource platform. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements which may or may not contain lease incentives is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and tradenames obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2012 . See Note 5Acquisitions and Note 8Intangible Assets, Net . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradename, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company tests each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2012 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2012 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Effective October 1, 2011, the Company adopted ASU 2011-08, which allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This step serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step test first compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2012 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2012 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. Litigation accruals associated with settled obligations to be paid over VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 periods longer than one year are recorded at the present value of future payment obligations. The obligation is accreted to its full payment value with the corresponding accretion charge included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees. See Note 21Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver Visa products and payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues represent revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway and PlaySpan's virtual goods payment platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for processing cross-border transactions, and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the cardholder's issuer country is different from the merchant's country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist primarily of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see  Note 2Visa Europe ), fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and certain activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. Foreign taxes paid have VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 historically been deducted to reduce federal income taxes payable. The Company intends to elect to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a \"bond duration matching\" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, approximately 8 years for United States plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities, and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative financial instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. See Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies issuing and acquiring clients from settlement losses suffered by the failure of any other customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with Visa's operating regulations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 sheets and is described in Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company also indemnifies Visa Europe for any claims brought against Visa Europe arising out of the provision of services by Visa's customer financial institutions, as described in Note 2Visa Europe . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance- and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 17Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 16Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, which provides requirements over pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures related to business combinations. The ASU requires disclosure of revenue and earnings of the combined business as if the combination occurred at the start of the prior annual reporting period only. The Company adopted ASU 2010-29 effective October 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, which impacts the presentation of comprehensive income. The guidance requires components of other comprehensive income to be presented with net income to arrive at total comprehensive income. This ASU impacts presentation only and does not impact the underlying components of other comprehensive income or net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASU 2011-05, which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. All other components of ASU 2011-05 are effective October 1, 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, which will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The standard will be adopted on October 1, 2012, and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2Visa Europe  As part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa common stock , a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. Visa Europe Put Option Agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the put option. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company's estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's-length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. The estimated fair value of the put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The valuation of the put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. The Company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011. In determining the fair value of the put option on these dates, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 1.9 x. During fiscal 2011, the Company reduced the value of the put option by $122 million , recording non-cash, non-operating other income in the consolidated statement of operations. The decrease in the value of the put option reflects the overall decrease in Visa's P/E during fiscal 2012 and 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. Reductions in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash other non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. Visa Call Option Agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATM's in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these triggers occurring is remote. The Framework Agreement. The relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed upon circumstances. The base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately $143 million per year for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. This fee is eligible for adjustment annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the annual fee below $143 million . The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. In addition to the licenses, Visa provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa's systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. The Company will indemnify Visa Europe for claims arising from activities in the field of financial payment and processing services brought outside Visa Europe's region and Visa Europe will indemnify Visa for any likewise claims brought within Visa Europe's region. The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be nominal at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation.\" These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of a litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement and a loss sharing agreement. Covered litigation consists of: ##TABLE_START  The Discover Litigation. Discover Financial Services Inc. v. Visa U.S.A.

Visa U.S.A., Inc. et al., Case No. CO4-4276 JSW (N.D. Cal.); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction. ##TABLE_END Litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the litigation escrow account: VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2012  Fiscal 2011  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 2,857  $ 1,936 Deposits into the litigation escrow account 1,715  1,200 American Express settlement payments (140 )  (280 ) Interest earned, less applicable taxes   Balance at September 30 $ 4,432  $ 2,857 Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund payment(See Note 21Legal Matters ) (350 )   Balance at October 29 $ 4,082   ##TABLE_ENDAn accrual for the covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company recorded an additional $4.1 billion accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012. See Note 21Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, by reducing the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the litigation escrow arrangement and agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange litigation, which is described in Note 21Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange litigation. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment in the interchange litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the retrospective responsibility plan.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Cash equivalents (money market funds), U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of government-sponsored and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from additional pricing sources and confirmed or revised accordingly. Commercial paper and foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2012 . Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no substantive change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2012 . Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company has granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which is carried at fair value in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the put option was VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 $145 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 . During fiscal 2011, the Company reduced the value of the put option by $122 million , recording non-cash, non-operating income in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 2Visa Europe . The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the put option. Earn-out related to PlaySpan acquisition. In connection with the PlaySpan acquisition, the Company initially recorded a liability of $24 million to reflect the fair value of a potential earn-out provision included in the purchase agreement. The liability is classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs, such as the likelihood of meeting certain future revenue targets and other milestones. The fair value of the earn-out decreased to $12 million at September 30, 2012 , primarily reflecting payments made upon achievement of certain revenue targets and other milestones during fiscal 2012 . The remaining liability related to the earn-out is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. See  Note 5Acquisitions  and  Note 8Intangible Assets, Net . A separate roll-forward of Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis is not presented because the primary activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 are already discussed above. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The Company recognized a $2 million OTTI during fiscal 2012 , compared with no impairment charges during fiscal 2011 and $3 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2010 . At September 30, 2012 and 2011 , these investments totaled $86 million and $100 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and tradenames obtained through acquisitions. See Note 5Acquisitions . The Company primarily uses an income approach for estimating the fair values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets when testing for and recording impairment, if any. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2012 , and concluded there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2012 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet but require disclosure of their fair values, including cash, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2012 , approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. Investments Trading Investment Securities Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 employees.

None of the additional goodwill recognized in these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Fundamo Acquisition . On June 9, 2011, the Company acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies. The acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of Visa's global strategy to provide for the next generation of payments solutions and to provide long-term growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or under-banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment.

Visa maintains a U.S. commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. This program allows the Company to issue up to $500 million of unsecured debt securities, with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance and at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The Company had no outstanding obligations under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 . Revolving Credit Facilities. In 2008, Visa entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the February 2008 Agreement). The February 2008 Agreement matures on February 15, 2013 , and contains covenants and events of defaults customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in this revolving credit facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Companys class B and class C common stock and certain of the Companys clients or affiliates of its clients. This revolving credit facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. The Company also agrees to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on the Companys credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15% , the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05% . There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 . Note 11Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plan The defined benefit pension plan benefits are based on years of service, age, and eligible compensation. Prior to January 1, 2011, employees hired before January 1, 2008, earned benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008, earned benefits based on a cash VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees began accruing benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased accruing benefits under any other formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Postretirement Benefits Plan The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. The assumed annual rate of future increases in health benefits for the other postretirement benefits plan is 7.5% for fiscal 2013 . The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2018 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million .  Pension Plan Assets Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2012 , plan asset allocations for the above categories were 65% , 27% and 8% respectively, which were within target allocation ranges with the exception of the other category. Pension plan assets in the other category were temporarily above the Company's target allocation due to an employer contribution made at the end of the plan year. The amount was subsequently reinvested in line with target asset allocations. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 , including the impact of unsettled transactions: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measurements at September 30   Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total            (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $          $  $ Collective investment funds     $  $       Corporate debt securities            Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies            Asset-backed securities         $  $   Equity securities            Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDLevel 1 assets. C ash equivalents (money market funds) and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefits plans, to invest in portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Although the single collective investment fund held by the plan is ultimately invested in the common stocks of companies in the SP 500 index, its own unit value is not directly observable, and it is therefore classified as Level 2. The fair values of government-sponsored and corporate debt securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2012 or 2011 . A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were immaterial.

Personnel costs included $37 million , $34 million and $29 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the plan. The Companys contributions to this plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, deposit access products, point-of-sale check service drivers and other instruments processed in accordance with the operating regulations. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk (or exposure) is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure was approximately $49.3 billion at September 30, 2012 , compared to $47.5 billion at September 30, 2011 . Of these amounts, $3.5 billion and $3.2 billion at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2012  September 30, 2011  (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $ Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,084  Guarantees 2,022  1,845 Total $ 4,236  $ 3,974 ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $1 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 . These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company enters into foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to manage the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. At September 30, 2012 , all derivative instruments outstanding mature within 12 months or less. The Company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Cash Flow Hedges The Company maintains a rolling hedge program with the objective of reducing exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months. The aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program were $690 million and $651 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. As of September 30, 2012 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $12 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $11 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between hedging transactions and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points was $16 million , $20 million and $17 million , respectively. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $19 million pre-tax, to earnings during fiscal 2013. In the event there is recognized ineffectiveness or the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the designated hedge period, or it becomes remote that the forecasted transaction will occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet to general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. The amount of gain or loss recognized in earnings related to ineffectiveness was $1 million or less for each of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. As these derivatives are not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses are recorded directly in earnings as part of general and administrative expense. The Company recorded less than $1 million of gains related to these derivatives during fiscal 2012. At September 30, 2012, these derivative contracts had an aggregate notional amount of $49 million , and a fair value of $1 million , which was classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments .  The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into agreements which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2012 , the Company has posted and received collateral of $3 million and $4 million , respectively, with counterparties, which are included in prepaid and other current assets, and accrued liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2012 . Note 14Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic area as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2012  September 30, 2011  (in millions) U.S. $ 1,539  $ 1,487 Non-U.S.  Total $ 1,634  $ 1,541 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the U.S. were approximately 55% , 56% and 58% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues are concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . Note 15Stockholders' Equity  VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 The number of shares of each class and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2012 , are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  (in millions except conversion rate) Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1)   Class A common stock     Class B common stock  0.4206   Class C common stock  1.0000   Total     ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures may not sum due to rounding. As-converted class A common stock count is calculated based on whole numbers. ##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2012 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion , $710 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, the Company made deposits totaling $1.7 billion  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. In July 2012 , the Company's board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013 . As of September 30, 2012 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million . In October 2012 , the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013 . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market during the following fiscal years: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data)  Shares repurchased in the open market (1) 6.2  26.6 Weighted-average repurchase price per share $ 114.87  $ 76.08 Total cost $  $ 2,024 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. ##TABLE_END Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2012  Fiscal 2011 (in millions, except per share and conversion data) July 2012  December 2011  March  October Deposits under the retrospective responsibility plan $  $ 1,565  $  $ Effective price per share (1) $ 125.50  $ 101.75  $ 73.81  $ 72.74 Reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock 1.2  15.4  5.4  11.0 Conversion rate of class B common stock to class A common stock after deposits 0.4206  0.4254  0.4881  0.5102 As-converted class B common stock after deposits    ##TABLE_ENDVISA INC.

The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa member or similar person or affiliate of a Visa member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. Class C Common Stock. As of September 30, 2012 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and 121 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred Stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . Voting Rights. The holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. All holders of class B and class C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any consolidation, merger, combination or any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the holders of class B and class C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or class C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends Declared. On October 24, 2012 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 4, 2012 , to all holders of record of the Companys class A, class B and class C common stock as of November 16, 2012 . The Company declared and paid $595 million in dividends in fiscal 2012 at a quarterly rate of $0.22 per share.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 Note 17Share-based Compensation  The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 59 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost of $147 million , $154 million and $135 million , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START     2010 (1) Expected term (in years) (2)  6.02  5.16  3.46 Risk-free rate of return (3)  1.2 %  1.2 %  1.4 % Expected volatility (4)  34.9 %  33.4 %  36.4 % Expected dividend yield (5)  0.9 %  0.8 %  0.7 % Fair value per option granted  $ 29.65  $ 27.50  $ 29.46 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Includes the impact of 1.6 million replacement awards issued to former CyberSource employees as part of the CyberSource acquisition in July 2010. These awards have a weighted-average exercise price of $47.34 per share and vest over a period of less than three years from the replacement grant date. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based on a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the average of the Companys implied and historical volatility. As the Companys publicly traded stock history is relatively short, historical volatility relies in part on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa.

As of September 30, 2012 , there was $17 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.9 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $96.39 , $79.80 and $79.58 , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $96.97 , $79.97 and $79.59 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $81 million , $55 million and $32 million , respectively.

The performance condition is based on either (1) the Company's earnings per share target or; (2) the Company's achievement of specified cumulative net income performance targets. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $97.84 , $85.05 and $88.06 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2012 vest approximately three years from the initial grant date. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2011 and 2010 vest in two equal installments approximately two and three years from their respective grant dates. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2012 , there was $8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.9 years. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 Note 18Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $89 million , $76 million and $59 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2012 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Capital leases            Marketing and sponsorships       Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,054 ##TABLE_ENDSelect sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly in excess of the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client Incentives. The Company has agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, with original terms ranging from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the balance sheet. Client Incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the customer's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of customer incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2012 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 2,277  $ 1,947  $ 1,590  $ 1,189  $  $  $ 8,201 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 19Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. There were no material operating expenses incurred during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and VISA INC.

At September 30, 2012 and 2011 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. Board representation. In January 2011, the Company's board made the decision to reduce its overall size. Subsequently, the non-executive board members have been comprised exclusively of independent directors. The Company generated total operating revenues of approximately $172 million and $597 million from clients represented on its board of directors during fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Investees. The Company generated total operating revenues of $19 million , $28 million and $27 million , and received dividend income of $1 million , $1 million and $2 million from related party investees during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.

The decrease in the Company's deferred tax liabilities is primarily due to the one-time, non-cash remeasurement as a result of changes in California state apportionment rules in fiscal 2012. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2012 valuation allowance relates primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2012 , the Company had $20 million federal, $116 million state and $70 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2021 through 2031 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Although the Companys ability to VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 utilize the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards was limited in fiscal 2012 , the Company expects to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2012 , the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4 million and $19 million , respectively. The federal carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2021 through 2029 . The state carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely . The Company also has federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $1 million , which do not expire . The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years. The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% to pretax income, as a result of the following:  ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30     Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  (in millions) U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate $  %  $ 1,980  %  $ 1,623  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  %   %   % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit (257 )  (12 )%  (150 )  (2 )%  (124 )  (2 )% Reversal of tax reserves related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense (299 )  (14 )%     %     % Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to:            California state apportionment rule changes (208 )  (9 )%     %     % Other state apportionment changes  %  (3 )   %    % Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %  (43 )  (1 )%  (28 )  (1 )% Other, net   %    %    % Income tax provision $  %  $ 2,010  %  $ 1,674  % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective income tax rate in fiscal 2012 was lower than that in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a decrease in the overall state tax rate due to changes in the California apportionment rules and the associated one-time, non-cash remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a one-time benefit recognized upon initial recognition of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the foregoing adjustments to a pre-tax income that was reduced by a $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2012. ##TABLE_END Income taxes receivable of $179 million and $112 million are included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. See Note 6Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2012 and 2011 , income taxes payable of $58 million and $63 million , respectively, are included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $171 million and $468 million , respectively, are included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 9Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the U.S. amounted to $2.6 billion at September 30, 2012 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the U.S. is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2014, and may be extended through September 30, 2023, if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentive agreement is conditional upon certain VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 employment and investment thresholds being met by the Company. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $130 million , $111 million and $93 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.19 , $0.16 and $0.13 in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. In accordance with ASC 740, the Company is required to inventory, evaluate, and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2012 and 2011 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $679 million and $850 million , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $679 million and $850 million are $537 million and $696 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1 $  $ Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years (445 )  (52 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year  Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations (1 )  (7 ) Ending balance at September 30 $  $ ##TABLE_ENDIt is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense, and general and administrative expense, respectively, in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2012, the Company reversed $45 million of interest expense primarily associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. In fiscal 2011 and 2010 , the Company recognized $7 million and $37 million of interest expense, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company reversed $1 million and $2 million of penalties, respectively. In fiscal 2010, the Company recognized $5 million of penalties. At September 30, 2012 and 2011 , the Company had accrued interest of $20 million and $65 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $7 million and $8 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.  In September 2012, the IRS completed the examination of the Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns with no significant adjustments. The statute of limitations for these years is expected to expire in June of 2013. Upon the successful completion of this examination in fiscal 2012, the Company reversed $425 million of unrecognized tax benefits, primarily related to the deductibility of covered litigation. The IRS will begin the examination of the Company's fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns in fiscal 2013. The Company's California fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the federal and California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2006. The Company's fiscal 2003 to 2009 Canadian income tax returns are currently under examination by the Canada Revenue Agency. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timings and outcomes of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impacts that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 21Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or amounts are not reasonably VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The Company recorded litigation provisions of $4.1 billion , $7 million and $(45) million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the settlement agreement in the Retailers' litigation  (discussed in Other Litigation below). The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals for certain legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on managements understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation for both covered and other non-covered litigation for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 : ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at October 1 $  $ Provision for unsettled legal matters 4,100   Provision for settled legal matters   Reclassification of settled matters (1)   Interest accretion on settled matters  Payments on settled matters (140 )  (302 ) Balance at September 30 $ 4,386  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Reclassification of amount previously recorded in accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . An accrual for the covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The Company recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012, which increased its total reserve for the covered litigation from $285 million to $4.4 billion . The current uncommitted balance of the covered litigation escrow account of $4.4 billion was deposited by the Company primarily with a view toward resolving the Interchange Litigation. The total accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Discover Litigation. On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard). The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was designated as a related case to a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 1998. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the implementation and enforcement of Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's Competitive Programs Policy, or CPP, which prohibited their respective members from issuing American Express or Discover cards violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and California's Unfair Competition Law, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys' fees and costs. On October 13, 2008, Visa, MasterCard and Discover reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. The parties executed a final settlement agreement on October 27, 2008 that became effective on November 4, 2008 upon approval by holders of Visa's class B common stock. Visa's net share of the settlement totaled $1.8 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 billion , of which $1.74 billion was paid over four quarters from the escrow account established by the retrospective responsibility plan. Visa Inc. also paid $80 million toward Visa's share in connection with releases obtained from MasterCard with respect to certain potential claims. Visa Inc. also paid an additional $65 million , which was refunded by Morgan Stanley, under a separate agreement related to the settlement. Visa's settlement obligations were fully satisfied with the September 2009 payment to Discover. The American Express Litigation. On November 15, 2004, American Express filed a complaint against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard and several Visa U.S.A. and Visa International member financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of Visa U.S.A.'s bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's CPP violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and sought money damages (subject to trebling) and attorneys' fees and costs. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into a settlement agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007. Under the settlement agreement, American Express received payments of $2.25 billion , including $2.07 billion from Visa Inc. and $185 million from five co-defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made on March 31, 2008, including $945 million funded through the litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning April 2008, Visa Inc. paid American Express an additional amount of $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a total of $1.12 billion . Visa's settlement obligations were fully satisfied with the January 2012 payment to American Express. The quarterly settlement payments were also covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The total settlement was recorded in fiscal 2007 at a discounted value of $1.9 billion using a rate of 4.72% over the payment term. The Attridge Litigation. On December 8, 2004, a complaint was filed in California state court on behalf of an alleged class of consumers asserting claims against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard under California's Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law. The claims in this action, Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al ., seek to piggyback on the portion of the DOJ litigation in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard's CPP constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. On May 19, 2006, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiff's Cartwright Act claims with prejudice but allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his Unfair Competition Law claims, which seek restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. On December 14, 2007, the plaintiff amended his complaint to add Visa Inc. as a defendant. No new claims were added to the complaint. On July 1, 2009, the court denied in part the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication, but ordered the parties to submit affidavits as to whether further discovery should be conducted prior to the court rendering judgment on the Motion for Summary Adjudication. On August 3, 2009, the court ruled the Motion submitted without any such further discovery. In the separate Indirect Purchaser Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases, also pending in California state court, Visa entered into a settlement agreement on September 14, 2009 which potentially could have had the effect of releasing the claims asserted in the Attridge case, subject to the ruling of the Attridge court. On September 24, 2009, the Attridge court deferred its decision on the Motion for Summary Adjudication pending court approval of the settlement in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases . On August 23, 2010, final approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement was granted. The plaintiff in Attridge and others appealed the final approval order. On February 15, 2011, the court ordered that the Attridge case be stayed until 30 days following the final resolution of the appeals in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases . On January 9, 2012, the appeals court reversed the approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. Attridge filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , which was granted. On June 4, 2012, the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases were reassigned to the Honorable John E. Munter, the same judge in the Attridge case. On July 17, 2012, the Attridge case was stayed until January 16, 2013. The Interchange Litigation Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL). Beginning in May 2005, approximately 55 complaints, all but 13 of which were styled as class actions, have been filed in U.S. federal district courts on behalf of merchants against Visa U.S.A. and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. Visa International VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 was also named as a defendant in more than 30 of these complaints. The cases allege, among other things, that Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their no surcharge rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees violate federal antitrust laws. On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings (MDL 1720). On April 24, 2006, the group of purported class plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint. Taken together, the claims in the First Amended Class Action Complaint and in the 13 complaints brought on behalf of individual merchants are generally brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In addition, some of these complaints contain certain state unfair competition law claims. These interchange-related cases seek money damages (alleged in the consolidated class action complaint to range in the tens of billions of dollars), subject to trebling, as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. As part of the retrospective responsibility plan, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain member financial institutions of Visa U.S.A. on July 1, 2007. On January 8, 2008, the district court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and granted defendants' motion to dismiss the class plaintiffs' claims for damages incurred prior to January 1, 2004. On January 29, 2009, class plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Among other things, this complaint: (i) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visa PIN-debit cards; (ii) added new claims for damages and injunctive relief against Visa and the bank defendants since the time of Visa's IPO regarding interchange reimbursement fees for Visa's credit, offline debit, and PIN-debit cards; (iii) eliminated claims for damages relating to the so-called no-surcharge rule and anti-steering rules; (iv) eliminated claims for damages based on the alleged tie of network processing services and payment guarantee services to the payment card system services; and (v) added Visa Inc. as a defendant. In addition, class plaintiffs filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint (the Supplemental Complaint) against Visa Inc. and several financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act. In the Supplemental Complaint, class plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. On February 7, 2011, Visa entered into an omnibus agreement that confirmed and memorialized the signatories' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to certain interchange litigation. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On July 13, 2012, Visa Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a memorandum of understanding (the MOU) which obligated the parties to enter into a settlement agreement in the form attached to the MOU to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. On October 19, 2012, those same parties signed a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include, among other terms: ##TABLE_START  A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL; ##TABLE_END 105 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 ##TABLE_START  Settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion , to be paid from the Company's previously funded litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan, see  Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have been paid to issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time. The eight month period for the reduction would begin within 60 days after completion of the court-ordered period during which individual class members may opt out of this settlement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances, subject to a cap and a level playing field with other general purpose card competitors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Agreement that the Company will meet with merchant buying groups that seek to negotiate interchange rates collectively. ##TABLE_END On October 19, 2012, the class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement. Objections to preliminary approval were filed before the preliminary approval hearing, which was held on November 9, 2012. The court granted preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement on November 9, 2012. Until the Settlement Agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. In addition, on October 19, 2012, the Company and the individual plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated with the MDL for coordination of pre-trial proceedings (the Individual Plaintiffs) signed a settlement agreement to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan on October 29, 2012. On November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the Individual Plaintiffs ' claims with prejudice. For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion , which increased its total reserve for the covered litigation from $285 million to $4.4 billion , to reflect the class plaintiffs' Settlement Agreement and the resolution of the Individual Plaintiffs' claims. Other Litigation In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation (\"the Retailers' litigation\"). Beginning in October 1996, several antitrust class action lawsuits were brought by U.S. merchants against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard. The suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . Among other claims, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa U.S.A.'s Honor All Cards rule, which required merchants that accepted Visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented Visa card, and a similar MasterCard rule, constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On June 4, 2003, the parties signed a settlement agreement that was approved by the court on December 19, 2003. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Visa agreed to modify its Honor All Cards rule such that a merchant may accept only Visa check cards, only Visa credit cards, or both. Visa also agreed to pay approximately $2.0 billion to the merchant class over 10 years in equal annual installments of $200 million per year, among other things. On August 31, 2009, Visa entered into an agreement to prepay its remaining $800 million in settlement payments for $682 million . On October 2, 2009, the court entered a final order approving the prepayment agreement, and Visa made the prepayment on October 5, 2009. Pursuant to its terms, the prepayment agreement became final after no appeals to the approval order were filed within the 30-day appeal period. Indirect Purchaser Actions. Complaints were also filed in 19 different states and the District of Columbia alleging state antitrust, consumer protection and common law claims against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard (and, in California, Visa International) on behalf of consumers. The claims in these class actions included allegations mirroring those made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and asserting that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs seek money damages and injunctive relief. Visa U.S.A. has been successful in the majority of these cases, as courts in 17 jurisdictions have granted Visa U.S.A.'s motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaints. In New Mexico, the court granted Visa U.S.A.'s motion to VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 dismiss at a hearing on May 14, 2010, and entered an order and judgment dismissing the case on June 9, 2010. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from that order and judgment on June 14, 2010. On April 18, 2012, the state appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the case. In California, in the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , the court dismissed claims brought under the Cartwright Act, but denied a similar motion with respect to Unfair Competition Law claims for unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices. On October 31, 2007, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to give collateral estoppel effect to certain elements of their tying claim based on statements in the ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment in In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation . On October 3, 2008, the parties agreed to confidential settlement terms to resolve the dispute. A written settlement agreement executed on September 14, 2009, was submitted to the court for approval. After the parties amended the settlement agreement in certain respects, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on January 5, 2010 and entered an order granting final approval on August 23, 2010. The plaintiff in Attridge , who had filed objections to the settlement, filed a notice of appeal from the final approval order, as have other objectors to the settlement. The amount of the settlement is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. On January 9, 2012, the Court of Appeal of the State of California reversed the judgment approving the settlement agreement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. Attridge filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , which was granted. On June 4, 2012, the court issued an order reassigning the case to the Honorable John E. Munter, the same judge in the Attridge case. The parties subsequently agreed upon a revised written settlement agreement, which was submitted to the court for preliminary approval on August 20, 2012 and executed as of September 6, 2012. Vale Canjeable. On November 21, 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A. filed an action in the Fifth Municipal Court of Caracas (Fifth Municipal court), Venezuela against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International seeking a preliminary injunction preventing use of the Visa Vale mark in Venezuela. On November 29, 2006, the Fifth Municipal court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants' use of Vale in the Venezuelan market of food vouchers. Visa filed a constitutional objection to that ruling on December 6, 2006. The objection was dismissed, and Visa appealed the decision through the appellate courts. After all appeals to the lower appellate courts had been rejected, on March 14, 2008, Visa filed an extraordinary appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling with the Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court). On August 6, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Visa's favor, declared the lower court's decision null and void, and remanded the case to the appellate court. Following the Supreme Court's order, on March 25, 2009, the First Commercial Judge of Appeals of Caracas issued a new decision, affirming the preliminary injunction and finding Visa and Todoticket liable for legal fees and costs in connection with the appeal. On July 9, 2009, Visa filed a further appeal, and on December 10, 2009, the Supreme Court again decided in Visa's favor, overturning the appellate ruling. The Supreme Court ordered a new appellate judge to consider the preliminary injunction that prevented Visa from using the Visa Vale trademark in Venezuela. On August 10, 2011, the court rejected Visa's appeal of the preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to pay costs. In parallel to this proceeding, in December 2006, the plaintiff also filed a claim with the Fourth Commercial Court of First Instance of Caracas (First Instance court), alleging that the defendants infringed the plaintiff's rights as the holder of the trademark registries and requesting declarative, injunctive and monetary relief. On September 25, 2007, Visa's request for removal of the First Instance judge from the case was granted. A new judge was assigned to finalize the discovery phase of the case. On February 11, 2010, the First Instance court dismissed in its entirety the plaintiff's claim against Visa and other defendants for damages based on trademark infringement. The plaintiff appealed. On August 10, 2011, the appellate court overturned the First Instance court's dismissal in part. The court refused to award plaintiff any damages or costs, but enjoined Visa and Todoticket from using the expression Vale in the Venezuelan food voucher market. Visa filed extraordinary appeals of both August 10 rulings with the Supreme Court. European Interchange Proceedings. On April 3, 2009, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections (SO) to Visa Europe, Visa International and Visa Inc. alleging a breach of European competition law. Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with the Statement of Objections on June 1, 2009. The SO alleged a VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 breach of Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The SO was directed to Visa Inc. and Visa International with respect to the Honor All Cards rule, the no-surcharge rule, and certain debit interchange fee practices. On August 10, 2009, Visa Inc. and Visa International filed a response to the SO. On April 26, 2010, Visa Europe announced an agreement with the European Commission, subject to public consultation, to end the proceedings with respect to Visa Europe's immediate debit interchange fees. After public consultation, on December 8, 2010, the European Commission concluded that the proposed agreement with Visa Europe addressed its competition concerns, made the agreement legally binding upon Visa Europe, and closed its investigation with regard to interchange fees for debit card transactions. On July 31, 2012, the European Commission announced a supplementary Statement of Objections that was sent to Visa Europe concerning interchange for consumer credit card transactions. Pursuant to existing agreements among the parties, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa International and Visa Inc. in connection with this proceeding, including payment of any fines that may be imposed. Canadian Competition Proceedings Competition Bureau. On April 21, 2009, Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada) received an oral notification from the Canadian Competition Bureau that it had initiated a civil inquiry regarding interchange and certain of Visa policies relating to merchant acceptance practices. The Bureau issued a voluntary draft information request to Visa on August 4, 2010, seeking information about certain merchant acceptance practices, interchange (including the setting of default interchange), and fees paid by issuers and acquirers to Visa. On December 15, 2010, the Commissioner of Competition filed a Notice of Application against Visa Canada and MasterCard. The proceeding challenges certain Visa policies regarding merchant acceptance practices, including Visa's no-surcharge and honour all cards policies under the Competition Act. Visa Canada filed a Response to the Notice of Application on January 31, 2011. On February 10, 2011, Toronto Dominion Bank and the Canadian Bankers Association sought leave to intervene in the proceeding; Visa supported such requests. Following a hearing on March 7, 2011, the Competition Tribunal granted the intervention requests. The hearing before the Competition Tribunal on the merits of the case was held from May 8, 2012 through June 21, 2012. Merchant Litigation . On December 17, 2010, a purported civil follow-on case to the Competition Bureau's proceeding was filed against Visa Canada and MasterCard in the Superior Court of Qubec, Canada, on behalf of a class of merchants and a class of consumers. The action, 9085-4886 Quebec Inc. et al. v. Visa Canada et al. , asserts claims under Section 76 of the Competition Act, which does not provide for a civil cause of action. Plaintiff seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief. On March 28, 2011, Mary Watson filed a class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, on behalf of merchants and others in Canada that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard ( Watson ). The suit, filed against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and ten financial institutions, alleges conduct contrary to section 45 of the Competition Act and also asserts claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiff alleges that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCard's respective no-surcharge and honour all cards rules had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On January 9, 2012, plaintiff filed a notice of application for certification of a class action. Defendants' responding certification material was delivered on October 15, 2012. On May 16, 2011, a merchant class action which effectively mirrors the Watson case was initiated in Ontario ( Bancroft-Snell ). As in Watson , the Bancroft-Snell complaint alleges conduct in contravention of Section 45 of the Competition Act, civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among other claims, and seeks similar relief. As a result of plaintiff's unopposed request on January 10, 2012, the Bancroft-Snell case is being held in abeyance pending further proceedings in the Watson case. On April 10, 2012, the court in the 9085-4886 Quebec Inc. case permitted the plaintiff to revise its complaint to effectively mirror the Watson case, and to add the same ten financial institutions as co-defendants. On June 13, VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 2012, at plaintiff's request and in light of the proceedings in the Watson case, the court entered an order staying the case until June 21, 2013. On July 12 and 13, 2012, merchant class actions which effectively mirror the Watson case were initiated in Saskatchewan ( Canada Rent A Heater (2000) Ltd. ) and Alberta ( 1023926 Alberta Ltd. ). In light of the proceedings in the Watson case, plaintiffs' counsel in both actions advised that no further proceedings will be taken and no Statement of Defense will be required without prior reasonable notice to the parties. Dynamic Currency Conversion. On August 31, 2010, Visa received a notice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) regarding a pending investigation into Visa's policies relating to the provision of Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) services. DCC refers to conversion from one currency to another, either of the price of goods or services by the merchant, or of cash withdrawals by an ATM. The ACCC has the authority to commence proceedings before the Federal Court of Australia and seek an injunction or fine if it can establish a breach of competition laws. No such proceedings have been commenced, and the potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. Data pass litigation. On August 27, 2010, a consumer filed a class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and Visa Inc. in federal district court in Connecticut. The plaintiff claims, among other things, that consumers who made online purchases at Amazon.com were deceived into also incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the alleged unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (data pass), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. Visa allegedly aided and abetted the conduct of the other defendants. Plaintiff seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Amazon.com as a defendant without prejudice on October 29, 2010. Webloyalty.com and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the case on November 1, 2010. On November 19, 2010, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding GameStop Corporation as a defendant, asserting additional claims against Visa under federal and state consumer protection statutes and state common law, and seeking certification of a class of persons and entities whose credit card or debit card data was improperly accessed by Webloyalty.com since October 1, 2008. Webloyalty.com asked the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate with this case, for pretrial proceedings, a case pending in federal district court in California in which Webloyalty.com and Movietickets.com (but not Visa) are named as defendants. On February 8, 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied Webloyalty.com's application to consolidate the case. On December 23, 2010, Webloyalty.com, GameStop, and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Call center litigation . On April 28, 2011, Francisco Marenco filed a request in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to amend his class action complaint to name Visa Inc. as the defendant. The court granted the request and Marenco filed the amended complaint on May 6, 2011. The lawsuit alleged that Visa recorded telephone calls to call center representatives without providing a disclosure that the calls may be recorded, in alleged violation of state law in California and several other states. On May 31, 2011, the parties executed a settlement agreement in an amount that is not material to Visa's consolidated financial statements. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 20, 2011, and on November 30, 2011, the court entered a final order approving the settlement and entering judgment in the case. This matter relates to and resolves the previously reported contractual indemnity claim tendered to Visa by a processing client in October 2010. Korean Fair Trade Commission. Following a complaint lodged by a Visa client, in July 2011 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) initiated an investigation into Visa's requirements for the processing of international transactions over VisaNet. The KFTC has the authority to issue an injunction or fine; the potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. Visa is cooperating with the investigation. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation. National ATM Council class action. On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa U.S.A., and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. The plaintiffs claim that the rule prevents non-bank ATM operators from attracting customers through lower prices, allegedly in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaint requests injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and damages in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling. On January 10, 2012, plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint against the same defendants. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint alleges that the ATM access fee rule prevents non-bank ATM operators from attracting customers to use other networks in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges that Visa's rule has enabled Visa to charge artificially high network fees for ATM transactions, to compensate ATM operators inadequately, and to compensate member banks excessively. Plaintiffs request injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and treble damages. Consumer class actions . In October 2011, three consumer class actions were filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. One case, Genese , adds three financial institutions as defendants. All three cases purport to represent classes of consumers in claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Stoumbos adds claims under antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes in certain states and the District of Columbia, and Bartron adds claims on behalf of sub-classes of consumers under such state laws. The consumer suits seek injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and treble damages; Bartron and Stoumbos also seek restitution where available under state law. On December 1, 2011, the plaintiff in the Stoumbos case filed a corrected complaint asserting the same claims as in the original complaint. On January 10, 2012, the Bartron and Genese complaints were combined into a single amended complaint, now captioned Mackmin . The amended complaint challenges the same ATM access fee rules and names Visa, MasterCard, and three financial institutions as defendants, but the putative class representatives are different from those in the original Bartron and Genese complaints. Mackmin purports to represent classes and sub-classes of consumers in claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes in certain states and the District of Columbia. The amended complaint seeks injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, treble damages, and restitution where available under state law. On January 30, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the defendant financial institutions filed motions to dismiss the complaints in the National ATM Council class action and the consumer class actions. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was held on September 5, 2012. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand. On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the Division) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's Fixed Acquirer Network Fee. Visa and its representatives have communicated and continue to communicate regularly with the Division and have provided materials in response to the CID. Visa is continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the Division in connection with the CID. Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter. On September 21, 2012, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the Bureau) requested that Visa provide on a voluntary basis documents and information regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section 920(b)(1)(B) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693o-2, and Regulation II, 12 C.F.R.  235.7(b) (commonly known as the Durbin Amendment and regulations). The request focuses on information related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. The revenue generated by the PIN Debit Gateway Service is not material to the Company's financial statements. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau and responding to its information requests. Note 22Subsequent Events On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2012 signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange MDL. Visa also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the MDL for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs on November 9, 2012. However, the settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval, which cannot be assured until received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. On October 24, 2012, the Company announced that Charles W. Scharf had been appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of the Company, effective November 1, 2012. On October 24, 2012, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 15Stockholders' Equity . On October 24, 2012, the Companys board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity . On October 29, 2012, the Company made a payment of $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2012 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2012 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors in this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2012 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2012 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business ##TABLE_END General Business Development Visa Inc., which we refer to as Visa or the Company, is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. It also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution clients. Visa Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa Canada Corporation and Inovant LLC became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe Limited remains owned and governed by its European member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of Visa Inc. Visa Inc. completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in March 2008. Since fiscal 2010, we have completed several acquisitions to accelerate the growth of Visa's digital, eCommerce and mobile commerce offerings. These include: CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants; PlaySpan Inc., a leading provider of digital goods transactions in online games, digital media and social networks; and Fundamo, a leading provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies. Business developments in fiscal 2013 included the following: ##TABLE_START  Leadership . Charles W. Scharf joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer and became a member of our board of directors on November 1, 2012. Ryan McInerney joined the Company as President on June 3, 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Product innovation . Visas fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms, enabling more Visa transactions in every channel, and extending the utility of our products and services to additional access points, such as eCommerce and mobile, new merchant segments and new geographies. We continue to invest in the development of eCommerce and mobile payment platforms, contact and contactless chip cards and devices, card product enhancements, authentication and security technologies and platforms, and money transfers. ##TABLE_END In mature markets, Visa continues to expand in digital channels. V.me, Visas digital wallet service and acceptance mark, is now commercially available in the United States where it is featured on more than fifty merchant sites, and has also launched in Australia and Canada. We have also licensed payWave, Visa's mobile NFC payment technology, to third-party wallet providers to help ensure their solutions are enabled with Visa's payment functionality, and we have signed agreements with several mobile operators to extend payment functionality to their mobile subscribers. In addition, we continue to certify NFC-enabled smartphones from device manufacturers for use with payWave, and we have partnered with Samsung to preload payWave on Samsungs NFC-enabled smartphones. To further support the enablement of NFC, Visa also offers the Visa Mobile Provisioning service  a solution that enables banks and mobile operators to securely provision mobile payment accounts on NFC-enabled smartphones. In emerging markets, Visa is helping to expand electronic payment services to the unbanked and underserved. Visa introduced the worlds first bank-grade managed service, making it easy and cost-efficient for financial institutions and mobile operators to offer mobile financial services to their consumers. Visas new managed service solution already enables mobile money programs in India and Rwanda. 4 ##TABLE_START  Client contracts. In 2013, we partnered with one of our largest financial institution clients to customize a processing solution using VisaNet that is designed to accelerate the growth of electronic payments, deliver added value to merchants and provide a better experience for account holders. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation . Rules were implemented in the United States during 2011 and 2012 with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), which regulates, among other things, debit interchange reimbursements rates, the availability of debit networks, financial institutions' and merchants' choices among these networks, and transaction routing. As a result, we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients. In July 2013, a federal court invalidated these rules and ordered the U.S. Federal Reserve to revise them. However, that order has been stayed, and the rules have been left in place, pending the resolution of an expedited appeal filed by the Federal Reserve to the federal appeals court. See Government Regulation below. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Interchange multidistrict litigation settlement . In 2012, we reached a settlement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals. We believe that this settlement ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. See Item 1ARisk FactorsOur retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. ##TABLE_END Nature of Operations Visa's mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce. We operate an open-loop payments network in which Visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between: (i) issuers  financial institutions that issue Visa-branded cards or payment products to account holders, and (ii) acquirers  financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. The issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. The acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. 5 A typical Visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her Visa-branded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the acquirer and routed through VisaNet to the issuer for authorization. Following authorization, a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer. The following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on VisaNet. Our operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues, and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. ##TABLE_START  Service revenues. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Service revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues. Data processing revenues  consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily generated from the number of transactions we process. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues. International transaction revenues consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. ##TABLE_END Although U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and typically do not result in a receivable or payable balance, settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. In order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network, we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to honor Visa-branded 6 cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The settlement indemnification applies to the amount of Visa payment transactions that have occurred, but have not yet settled. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. During the past ten years, Visa has incurred only one settlement indemnification loss for fifty thousand dollars in 2004. Core Products and Services Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: (i) pay now with debit; (ii) pay ahead with prepaid; or (iii) pay later with credit products. Visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital, eCommerce and mobile products and services. These services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. ##TABLE_START  Debit . Our debit payment solutions support issuers' payment products that draw on demand deposit accounts, such as checking accounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Prepaid. Our prepaid payment solutions support issuers' payment products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing account holders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Credit. Our credit payment solutions support issuers' deferred payment and customized financing products. ##TABLE_END Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added services, including information products, such as risk scoring and loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our network. Visa's processing services continue to expand to address the needs of all participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa Debit Processing Services (\"DPS\"). Merchant gateway services provided through our CyberSource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online. DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. These and other services support our financial institution clients and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network. Processing Infrastructure VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the United States, which are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement among Visa Inc., Visa Europe Limited and others, Visa Europe's processing centers in the United Kingdom must maintain interoperability with Visa's synchronized system. Intelligent access points around the world complete the VisaNet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. Visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the United States and internationally, including those we added with our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan. These facilities enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders, our financial institution clients and our processing partners. Intellectual Property Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our Visa, Plus, the Winged V design and the Dove design marks are important to our business. Through agreements with our financial institution clients, we authorize the use of some of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. 7 Seasonality We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. Working Capital Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Concentration of Business and Financial Information About Geographic Areas For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business included elsewhere in this report. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment. These include: ##TABLE_START  paper-based payments, principally cash and checks; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid and private-label products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  eCommerce and mobile-based payments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house (\"ACH\"), and electronic data interchange. ##TABLE_END Based on payments volume, total volume and number of transactions, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2012: ##TABLE_START Company  Payments Volume  Total Volume  Total Transactions  Cards   (billions)  (billions)  (billions)  (millions) Visa Inc. (1)  $ 4,018  $ 6,409  81.6  2,128 MasterCard (2)  $ 2,693  $ 3,647  46.3  1,158 American Express (2)  $  $  5.9  Discover (2)  $  $  2.1  JCB (2)  $  $  1.6  Diners Club (2)  $  $  0.2  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The data presented is provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data is subject to review by Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1014 (March 2013) and Discover data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1009 (January 2013). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products. ##TABLE_END Certain general purpose payment network competitors are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. Our competitors also have leading positions in certain countries. For example, China UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. In the global debit network market segment, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands, including STAR, NYCE and PULSE in the United States, EFTPOS in Australia, NETS in Singapore and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the debit 8 network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands provide the primary network, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume. The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. We may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model. The emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal, Google and Isis are examples. These providers compete with us directly in some cases, yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours.  We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience, interoperability, accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate. We do so by partnering with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. Employees At September 30, 2013, we employed approximately 9,500 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Government Regulation Interchange reimbursement fees . We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the United States and many other geographies. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve implemented new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, setting a cap on the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions. These rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues. As a result, we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients. In July 2013, a federal court invalidated the newly implemented rules, finding that the Federal Reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction, regardless of authorization method. Although the court ordered the Federal Reserve to revise the rules, it stayed that order, and the rules have been left in place pending the resolution of an expedited appeal filed by the Federal Reserve to the federal appeals court. See  Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business and Item 7  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview included elsewhere in this report. Certain jurisdictions outside the United States also regulate debit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates. In some jurisdictions, such as India, the governing authorities have begun to regulate other rates or practices such as the merchant discount rate. See Item 1ARisk FactorsAdditional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business and Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Network exclusivity and routing . We have historically had agreements under which issuers received incentives if they agreed to issue Visa-branded cards or payment products that are processed through VisaNet. Historically, issuers of some debit products outside the United States have chosen to include only our network. These various practices are referred to as network exclusivity. The Dodd-Frank Act limits the issuers' and our ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the U.S. debit network market segment. Other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations. See  Item 1ARisk FactorsThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business included elsewhere in this report. 9 U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The Bureau's future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers, acquirers, consumers and merchants. No-surcharge rules . We have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their Visa-branded card or payment product instead of other means. As part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation, however, Visa has agreed to modifications of our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances. See Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Eleven U.S. states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the United States have taken steps to limit these no-surcharge rules. In October 2013, a federal court granted declaratory relief and issued an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of New York's no-surcharge law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law section 518, based on the entry of a stipulated final judgment in a case brought by five retailers challenging the constitutionality of that law. Data protection and information security . In accordance with governing law, we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the United States to examine our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctioned countries . We are subject to increasingly expanding legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other illicit activity. We devote substantial internal and external resources and have implemented programs that are designed to prevent the use of our payments network in facilitating such illegal activity. In addition, some of our products and services may be subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). These programs prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We have developed and implemented policies, procedures, systems and internal controls that are designed to comply with OFAC requirements and comparable sanctions programs. Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions . Our market reach remains limited by certain governments' influence on their domestic payments competition and/or their protection of domestic issuers or payment network processors. Regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries. Regulation of Internet transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants, including our financial institution clients and us, to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of Internet payment transactions. For example, U.S. federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify Internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such transaction requests. State governments have been interested in the potential blocking of Internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol, or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such Internet purchases. Implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us, and may reduce merchant acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products for these purchases. The U.S. Congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients' ability to offer existing products and services, extend credit via payment cards and products, and offer new types of payment programs, which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues. 10 Available Information We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and its rules and regulations.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification. We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the United States and many other geographies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has limited our ability to establish default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the United States. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Interchange reimbursement rates have also become subject to continued or increased government regulation elsewhere, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates. In certain jurisdictions, interchange reimbursement rates, our operating regulations and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation. These jurisdictions include, for example, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Europe, India, Malaysia, Russia and South Africa. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers find our payments system less attractive. This lowers overall transaction volume and slows growth of transactions. It also may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. In addition, we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers. In some instances, this makes Visa-branded cards and payment products less desirable and reduces our transaction volumes and profitability. Some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the level of Visa interchange reimbursement rate, leading merchants not to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products for payment or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems. In addition, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the rates that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs. For these reasons, additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . In order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into the network processing their transactions, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use 11 only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, Visa's rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through VisaNet and that a member must clear international transactions through VisaNet. These are commonly referred to as routing rules. The Dodd-Frank Act already limits our and issuers' ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Additional regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process. In order to retain that transaction volume, we would have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers, acquirers or merchants. Any of these eventualities could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. In July 2013, a federal court invalidated these rules, finding that the Federal Reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction, regardless of authorization method. The Federal Reserve has appealed that ruling. These regulations have adversely affected our U.S. debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing, reduced the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminished associated revenues. Although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the regulations as issued in October 2011, our business could continue to be affected, including if the Federal Reserve must issue new regulations. These pressures have arisen through various channels. A number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs. Some imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. Many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. Other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. These actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules. Our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, the regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act could continue to have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. New laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings . 12 Regulators around the world increasingly note each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Dodd-Frank Act and the European Union Commission ' s draft interchange regulation are developments with such potential. Similarly, new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments. The risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings. As a result, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, network exclusivity, preferred routing, dynamic currency conversion, point of sale transaction rules and practices, and operating regulations that may differ from country to country or by product offering. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions. In addition, adverse developments, regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands . Governments in some countries provide resources or protection to select their domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country. For example, China UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. These actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there. These actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets. Although we are trying to effect change in these countries, we may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands. Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of Visa-branded cards issued, our payments volume and our revenues . Privacy, data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions who have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices. These measures may increase our and our clients' costs. They may also decrease the number of Visa-branded cards our clients issue. This would materially and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. Evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues . Regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly. Examples include: ##TABLE_START  Data protection and information security . Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulatory compliance . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with ##TABLE_END 13 specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. Some of our clients located outside of the United States may not be subject to these same laws, regulations and sanctions, and, as a result, may initiate transactions that, while permissible in their countries, are not permissible in the United States. We have policies, procedures, systems and controls in place to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions but in the event these controls should fail, we could be subject to penalties, reputational damage and loss of business. ##TABLE_START  Regulation of the price of credit . Many jurisdictions in which Visa-branded cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act of 2009 in the United States and other proposed regulations under it. Proposed changes to the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, if implemented along with regulations required to be promulgated under the Credit CARD Act, could result in a decrease in our payments volume and revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Increased central bank oversight. Several central banks around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the retail electronic payments industry, in some cases considering designating them as \"systemically important payment systems\" or \"critical infrastructure.\" Any such oversight may lead to additional regulations by central banks and other government regulators. These could include new settlement procedures, cyber security requirements or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for financial institution client participation and merchant access to our payments system. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Safety and soundness regulation . Recent banking regulations enacted in the United States and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less attracted to becoming an issuer of Visa-branded cards, because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Regulation of Internet transactions . Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using Visa-branded cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the laws that govern the transactions, their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property rights. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Money transfer regulations. As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. state money transfer regulations, which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance costs. ##TABLE_END Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Our programs and policies are designed to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions regulations, and we continue to review and enhance them. But, as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. The impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which Visa-branded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept Visa-branded cards. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation Risks Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments . Our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation, which is described in Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our IPO and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings). They also include a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement. In addition, our U.S. financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. 14 The principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates. Since 2005, approximately fifty-five complaints, all but thirteen of which were styled as class actions, have been filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain financial institutions that issue Visa-branded payment cards and acquire Visa-branded payment transactions in the United States. We refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation. Among other allegations, the plaintiffs have alleged that Visa's setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal and state antitrust laws. The lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages would be trebled. The allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Visa's portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan. On October 19, 2012, we signed settlement agreements in these cases, which included an agreement to pay approximately $4.0 billion to the class plaintiffs. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs on November 9, 2012. However, the agreement with the class plaintiffs remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals. We cannot assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeals. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. A number of merchants have filed opt-out cases in various federal district courts. Some of these cases have already been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings to MDL 1720 and will be covered litigation under the retrospective responsibility plan. It is possible that some opt-out cases may not be transferred or otherwise included in MDL 1720 and will not be covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report . Failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent. The retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation. The plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our IPO that are transferred for pre-trial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation. See  If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages . In addition, non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business. See  Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability . Therefore, even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of, and judgments in, the covered litigation, it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation. If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages . Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition/antitrust law, consumer protection law or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. Particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers, private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business. If we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit, such as the U.S. or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be significant. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 15 If we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material pending or future legal proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages. This could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition and could even cause us to become insolvent. Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability . Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. We may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation. For example, under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, we have agreed, among other things, to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances. These and other settlements of, or judgments in, past, pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we charge, revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use Visa-branded payment products, or make other modifications to our business. These modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume, revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws applicable to us, could materially increase our tax payments . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material, adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We have limited rights to enforce our agreement with Visa Europe, which includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities . In the event Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations under the Framework Agreement, our remedies are limited. We are unable to terminate the agreement even upon Visa Europe's material, uncured breach. We also have a call option to acquire Visa Europe, which can be triggered only under extremely limited circumstances. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\") in connection with the European Competition Proceedings, in our opinion, including payment of any fines that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has expressed an \"initial\" view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for any claim in the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. If Visa Europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity, we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. In addition, under the Framework Agreement, we may be required to indemnify Visa Europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions giving rise to such claims. The indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. Business Risks The intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits . In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their Visa-branded card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments. We have continued to increase the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the United States. In 16 addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing in situations where our products are co-resident with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Dodd-Frank Act have also increased our use of incentives. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As a result, the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or unprofitable, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Pressure on client pricing also poses additional challenges for our business. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly, in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. Finally, increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, and we may not succeed in these efforts. Intense competition in our industry may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth to suffer . The global payments industry is intensely competitive. Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks, and electronic and mobile transactions. In addition, our open-loop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closed-loop systems. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased this competitive pressure. Some of our competitors may develop substantially greater technology or have greater financial resources. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services than we do, including more innovative ones. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. These include domestic networks in the United States, China, Canada and Australia. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. Traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients' long-term commitments to our products has increased with the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. We do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice despite significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our clients. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties; ##TABLE_END 17 ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, eCommerce payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new players and intermediaries in the value chain may direct the payment decision - making or impair the value of the services we provide. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business . Our position in the payments value chain is key to our business. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. Regulatory actions such as the Dodd-Frank Act may provide them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in us losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth . Additional consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors or with one of our competitors directly. This could result in the acquired financial institution's Visa business shifting to a competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of new and existing clients and could increase their negotiating power. This consolidation could lead new financial institution clients to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us. In addition, more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Merchants' continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation, regulation, regulatory enforcement, incentive arrangements and other initiatives . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa-branded payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits. If they continue, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses. We also face competitive pressures on pricing. We and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of Visa-branded payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants. Some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions, using both traditional and new technology platforms. Examples include closed-loop payment systems that are specific to a single merchant or multi-merchant solutions like the Merchant Customer Exchange, which is designed for a mobile 18 platform and has many merchant participants. Such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers, including discounts or customized offers. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our transaction volume. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives. Certain financial institutions have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues . Certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. In addition, these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business and revenues. Failure to maintain relationships with issuers, acquirers, merchants and account holders, and the failure of our financial institution clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business . We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers. In the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the network exclusivity rules, we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants, acquirers and processors. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with merchants, who directly receive incentive funding from us. We also engage with merchants, acquirers and processors to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. Outside the United States, some governments only permit their domestic processing, which prohibits us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of the transactions. Therefore, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving Visa-branded cards. Our inability to oversee the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and to the extent that such third-party vendors fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be impaired. Negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation, which are key assets of our business . Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry's quality of service, corporate responsibility, use and protection of account holder data, regulatory compliance, financial condition and other factors. Negative perception or publicity, particularly in light of the rapid, widespread use of social media channels, could cause damage to our brands and reputation. Our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients, other third parties or circumstances that are outside our control: ##TABLE_START  Our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as adverse creditor practices. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brands in Europe could affect our brands and reputation globally. While Visa Europe has very broad latitude to use our brands and ##TABLE_END 19 technology within its region, Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance, promoting or maintaining the strength of our brands. ##TABLE_START  We may be associated with adverse developments with respect to our industry, and with new rules and regulations concerning human rights conditions, our corporate responsibility regarding those conditions and resulting disclosure requirements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Any negative perception of the United States arising from its political, economic, social or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brands globally by associating Visa with those positions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could require us to take on additional liabilities and costs, result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, and materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have affected and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and account holders, and may potentially impact our prospects, profitability, revenue and overall business . The current threats to economic growth include geopolitical instability in the Middle East, which could affect oil prices, economic fragility in the Eurozone and in the United States, potential reduction or tapering of bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve, higher interest rates hurting the housing markets, persistently weak job creation, political discord, spending cuts and debt defaults. While there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies, emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth. Consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels, excess housing inventory, deflation, changes in savings rates, continued equity market volatility, decreased export activity, lowered government spending and additional government intervention. Furthermore, continued challenges in the credit environment, bank instability, downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt, political issues affecting the handling of national debt, and the uncertainty arising from new government policies all must be considered. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world. These include defaults on government debt, exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps. Most recently, the economic situations in the United States and various countries in Europe have been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of debt defaults. If such defaults occur, or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability, economic turmoil is likely to result, and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant. The volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones. These include the following: ##TABLE_START  Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budgets or increase requests for greater incentives or reduced fees from us, which may reduce our revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, affecting our revenue and reducing account holders' desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may increase account holder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing their value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business with those institutions or otherwise alter their business decisions. ##TABLE_END 20 ##TABLE_START  Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in the U.S. debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are in U.S. treasury and government securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage loan commitments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Declines in stock prices or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially. ##TABLE_END Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, growth, revenue, profitability and overall business. A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions . We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions, and our clients pay us fees in connection with them. Some of those fees differ when conversion from the merchant's currency to the issuer's billing currency is required. Thus, revenue from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuates with cross-border activity and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency. In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients' settlement in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as a result of regulation, litigation, competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical, economic, social and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, social or political instability, natural disasters, effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases. The need for conversion of currencies declines as cross-border travel is impacted, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Moreover, if our clients decide to change practices (e.g., prohibit certain transactions or increase account holder fees associated with cross-border transactions) there could be a decline in account holder spending because their value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. Transactions outside the United States represent an increasingly important part of our strategy, which we hope will continue to grow. However, a decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and multi-currency transactions will decrease the number of cross-border transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. While the term and amount of our indemnification obligations have no limit, our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of 21 operations. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We estimate settlement exposure under the indemnity based on the sum of three inputs. The first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin. The second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume. The third is the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. We generally guarantee the payment of any validly issued Visa Travelers Cheque that has been negotiated in good faith and properly presented for payment in the event that the Cheque is not honored by its issuing institution. Additionally, from time to time, we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions. Some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or with new laws and regulations, the use of our products, our revenues and net income could decline . Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry. These include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile, and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties' intellectual property rights. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised, the perception of our brands, and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected . Our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunctions, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, effects of climate change or other catastrophic events. In addition, our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computer-based attacks. The latter could include computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. See  Account data breaches involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues . If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Finally, potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs, both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability. 22 Account data breaches involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues . Our clients, merchants, other service providers and we process, store or transmit account holder information in connection with Visa-branded cards and payment products. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. Breach of the systems processing, storing or transmission of sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, reputational damage and claims against us. If we are sued in connection with any material data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards, which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, any data security breach could result in additional regulation, which could materially increase our compliance costs. An increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards or payment products . Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder information. They use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving our payment products. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using Visa-branded cards or payment products. A rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products, or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs and materially and adversely affect our payments volume and revenues. Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands . Visa and Visa Europe maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and us could negatively affect account holders from Visa Europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in Visa Europe's region. Failure to authorize, clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands. Structural and Organizational Risks Due to the nature of our relationship and the terms we have agreed to with Visa Europe, we have little ability to control its operations in its region, and as a result, we may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business . Visa Europe's exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the Framework Agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee Visa Europe's operations in its region. If we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to Visa Europe and its members, Visa Europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated costs. This may result in added costs and expenses to our business. Furthermore, the licenses granted under the Framework Agreement may raise licensing, payment and associated tax treatment concerns. Visa Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region. If the acquired business has operations in Visa Europe's region, Visa Europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there. Finally, Visa Europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies, including, but not limited to, our ongoing litigation in the U.K. and our ongoing case with the European Commission, that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally. If Visa Europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock under its put option, we are likely to incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income . 23 We have granted Visa Europe a put option, which Visa Europe can exercise at any time and which would require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from Visa Europe's members within 285 days. We are likely to incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more and may need to obtain third-party financing in order to meet our obligation through the issuance of either debt or equity. An equity offering, or the payment of part of the exercise price with our stock, would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We may also encounter difficulties in integrating Visa Europe's business and systems into our existing operations. If we cannot do so quickly and cost-effectively, the integration could divert the time and resources of senior management, disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we would become subject to any ongoing or future regulatory disputes as a result of EU regulations that govern the operations of Visa Europe. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. We record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations. Consequently, the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share. These quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant. The existence of these changes in the fair value of the put option could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and increase any associated costs. If we cannot remain organizationally effective, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly challenging competitive, economic and regulatory environment . We continue to centralize our management and operations. For us to succeed organizationally, we must effectively integrate our operations, actively work to ensure consistency throughout our enterprise, and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, if we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our risks, execute our strategy, and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes, as needed, we may not be successful in this competitive, economic and regulatory environment. We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees . Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets by key management and other key employees, which could adversely affect our business. Acquisitions, strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations . Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. We are also subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in Visa Europe's territory, which will impact our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that they will be successful. With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisitions or through organic development. These include digital, eCommerce and mobile payments. Our recent entry into these businesses requires additional 24 resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B common stock, could result in dilution to holders of our existing class A common stock, which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class A common stock . The market price and voting power of our class A common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding. The market price of our class A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur, such as upon the issuance or conversion of certain securities to shares of our class A common stock under the retrospective responsibility plan. Specifically, upon the final resolution of our covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted . Under our retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class B common stock will become convertible into shares of class A common stock, benefiting the holders of class B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class A common stock. The amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution. Holders of our class B and C common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions, and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class A common stock . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control . Provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation, in our current bylaws and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to Visa Members, as defined in our current certificate of incorporation, no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows . Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. The payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If, as a result of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends to our stockholders. Furthermore, if a dividend is declared or paid, an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding class A, B and C common stock in the future.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2013 reflects the impacts of a slow-moving global economic recovery. Interchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. The court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on November 27, 2012. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that Visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we paid $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on October 29, 2012, and on November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants' claims with prejudice. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 33 million shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion of cash on hand. In July 2013, our board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2014. As of September 30, 2013, the July program had remaining authorized funds of $251 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2013 have been completed. In October 2013 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the prior or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Reversal of tax reserves. During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This increased our net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END 31 ##TABLE_START  Deferred tax adjustment. During fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. ##TABLE_END The following tables present our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2013 (in millions, except for percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1)  Net Income Attributable to Visa Inc.

The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. ##TABLE_END Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except U.S. consumer debit, which has been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012. The number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate, reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 32 The following tables present nominal payments volume.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. 34 Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of travel activities, facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Non-operating Income Non-operating income mainly includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions; income, gains and losses earned on investments; and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 6,379  $ 5,720  $ 5,135  $  $  %  % International 5,177  4,478  3,846    %  % Visa Europe    (1 )    %  % Total Operating Revenues $ 11,778  $ 10,421  $ 9,188  $ 1,357  $ 1,233  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. Operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the United States during the second half of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2013, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2012. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2014 , a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2014, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. 35 The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 5,352  $ 4,872  $ 4,261  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 4,642  3,975  3,478    %  % International transaction revenues 3,389  3,025  2,674    %  % Other revenues      %  % Client incentives (2,321 )  (2,155 )  (1,880 )  (166 )  (275 )  %  % Total Operating Revenues $ 11,778  $ 10,421  $ 9,188  $ 1,357  $ 1,233  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Service revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily due to 8% and 10% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues in fiscal 2012 was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume, primarily in volume related to Interlink, which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10% and 5% , respectively, combined with pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily reflecting 10% and 11% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 , reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. These included a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal 2013. Additionally, client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume. Activity in fiscal 2012 also reflects certain one-time incentives incurred outside the United States. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% for the full 2014 fiscal year. ##TABLE_END 36 Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,932  $ 1,726  $ 1,459  $  $  %  % Marketing       %   % Network and processing      %  % Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative        %  % Litigation provision  4,100   (4,097 )  4,093  NM  NM Total Operating Expenses (2) $ 4,539  $ 8,282  $ 3,732  $ (3,743 )  $ 4,550  (45 )%  NM ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excluding the litigation provision of $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012, associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 12% over fiscal 2011 on an adjusted basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel increased in fiscal 2013 mainly due to increases in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in key product and geography-specific initiatives, combined with severance charges incurred as a result of organizational restructuring that better aligns our costs and strategic priorities. The increase in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to increases in headcount, and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 when compared to the respective prior year. Fiscal 2013 activity mainly reflected strategies to promote our core products, combined with a number of various campaigns, including the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Marketing in fiscal 2012 mainly reflected sponsorship of the 2012 London Summer Olympics, as well as spend in support of our new product initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing in fiscal 2013 and 2012 increased mainly due to costs incurred for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional fees increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 , primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 after experiencing an increase in fiscal 2012 mainly due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision in  fiscal  2012 reflects a $4.1 billion accrual related to the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Non-operating Income Non-operating income in fiscal 2013 of $18 million decreased from $68 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012 of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19Income Taxes and Note 20Legal Matters  37 to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2012 from $200 million in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the absence of a $122 million non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of a pre-tax gain of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Solues e Servios, or CBSS; offset by ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the reversal of previously accrued interest expense discussed above. ##TABLE_END Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rates of 3% and 36% in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  the decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result of changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2013 : ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011 . ##TABLE_END Adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 . Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate  (in millions, except for percentages) As reported $ 2,207  $  % Reversal of tax reserves (43 )    Litigation provision 4,098  1,505   Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities     Adjusted $ 6,262  $ 2,061  % ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: 38 ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:  ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 3,022  $ 5,009  $ 3,872 Investing activities (1,164 )  (2,414 )  (2,299 ) Financing activities (1,746 )  (2,655 )  (3,304 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents    (9 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $  $ (53 )  $ (1,740 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year, reflecting payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the covered litigation. As these payments were made from our litigation escrow account, they were also reflected as cash inflows under financing activities. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The tax deduction related to these payments contributed to the $1.5 billion decline in overall income taxes paid during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities would have totaled $5.9 billion , an increase over fiscal 2012, reflecting continued growth in operating revenues. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting higher operating revenues in fiscal 2012. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. Cash used in financing activities also reflects cash inflows relating to payments made in connection with the covered litigation from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan , Note 14Stockholders' Equity and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, our access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $4.3 billion at September 30, 2013 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use 39 in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries, which we estimate to be approximately $3.8 billion . It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in the United States. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $2.8 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1ARisk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. On February 7, 2013 , we replaced the existing $500 million program with a new commercial paper program. Under the new program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the new program at September 30, 2013 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit facility. On January 31, 2013 , we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. This credit facility, which expires on January 30, 2014, replaced our existing $3.0 billion credit facility, which would have expired on February 15, 2013 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under the new credit facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants at September 30, 2013 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2013 , was $49 million and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2013 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 40 Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2013 , however, we were only required to fund settlement-related working capital on a few days, including a peak net settlement receivable balance of $36 million. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $198 million. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013 , we made $4.4 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the settlement agreement, if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement, defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Upon final court approval of the settlement agreement, Visa's portion of the takedown payments, calculated to be $1.1 billion , will increase our current taxable income. The resulting increase in our current taxable income will increase our deferred tax asset and income tax payable by $387 million, which will have a negative impact on our free cash flow in the year the final court approval is rendered. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2013 , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $49 million . See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 33 million shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion of operating cash on hand. At September 30, 2013, we had $251 million of remaining funds available for share repurchases under the current program authorized by the board of directors. In October 2013 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2013 , we paid $864 million in dividends. In October 2013 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.40 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $255 million in connection with this dividend on December 3, 2013 . See Note 14Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the \"P/E ratio\" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the \"adjusted sustainable income\" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2013 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may 41 need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2013 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2013 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2013 , the spot P/E ratio was 21.5 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. ##TABLE_START  Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $100 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $100 million     (in millions)  (in millions)    $2,500  $625    $2,000  $500    $1,500  $375  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. ##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million , $88 million, and $74 million, respectively. The lower contribution in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012. In fiscal 2014 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $12 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2013 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. Acquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012, compared to fiscal 2011, when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. 42 Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2013 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.0 billion of assets and $160 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million , or 2% , had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million , and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other clients to honor Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2013. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $  $  $  $   $ 1,187 Leases (2)     Client incentives (3) 2,835  3,969  2,406  1,705  10,915 Marketing and sponsorship (4)     Dividends (5)        Total (6,7,8) $ 4,228  $ 4,480  $ 2,621  $ 1,965  $ 13,294 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to ##TABLE_END 43 existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. ##TABLE_START (4)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes expected dividend amount of $255 million as dividends were declared in October 2013 and will be paid on December 3, 2013 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 15, 2013 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $453 million. At September 30, 2013, we also accrued $29 million of interest and $3 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2013 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued 44 systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2013 , client incentives represented 16% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value  Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2013 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. 45 P/E differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2013 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. 46 Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2013. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.3 billion and $739 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2013 , is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $85 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2013 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 47 Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2013 and 2012 were $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $38 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2013 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.1 billion and $923 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2013 . We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risk Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion and $973 million and projected benefit obligations were $897 million and $990 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2014 , if any, which would be made in September 2014. 48 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP San Francisco, California November 21, 2013  50 VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2013 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\") and Inovant LLC (\"Inovant\") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the retrospective responsibility plan (the \"October 2007 reorganization\" or \"reorganization\"). See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Non-controlling interests are reported as a component of equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Beginning in fiscal 2013, current income tax receivable is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Previously, it had been included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line. The Company also combined the interest income (expense), investment income and other lines on the consolidated statements of operations into one line entitled, \"Non-operating income.\" All prior period information has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters for a discussion of the covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together 61 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income, on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities include auction rate securities, the Visa Europe put option and the earn-out related to the PlaySpan acquisition. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. The Company had no OTTI for available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2013 and 2011. The Company recognized $4 million of OTTI for available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2012. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships 62 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, the Visa Europe put option and the earn-out provision related to the PlaySpan acquisition. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with the Company's operating regulations. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17Commitments and Contingencies . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. 63 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payment network and CyberSource platform. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and tradenames obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2013 . See Note 7Intangible Assets, Net . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradename, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company tests each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2012-02, which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company adopted ASU 2012-02 effective October 1, 2012, and applied the new guidance in its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2013. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2013 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2013 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2013 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2013 . 64 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. Litigation accruals associated with settled obligations to be paid over periods longer than one year are recorded at the present value of future payment obligations. The obligation is accreted to its full payment value with the corresponding accretion charge included in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see  Note 2Visa Europe ), fees from account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. Foreign taxes paid have historically been deducted to reduce federal income taxes payable. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a \"bond duration matching\" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 8 years for United States plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2013, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies financial institution clients from settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to honor Visa- 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with Visa's operating regulations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company  indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region, as described in Note 2Visa Europe . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, which impacts the presentation of comprehensive income. The guidance requires components of other comprehensive income to be presented with net income to arrive at total comprehensive income. This ASU impacts presentation only and does not impact the underlying components of other comprehensive income or net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASU 2011-05, which deferred the requirement to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income. All other components of ASU 2011-05 became effective October 1, 2012. Adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, which established the effective date for the requirement to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income. The standard impacts presentation only and does not impact the underlying components of other comprehensive income or net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2013. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies the scope of ASU 2011-11. As amended, ASU 2011-11 requires disclosure of the effect or potential effect of offsetting arrangements on a Company's financial position as well as enhanced disclosure of the rights of offset associated with a Company's recognized derivative instruments, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The amended standard impacts presentation only and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2013. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Note 2Visa Europe  As part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa common stock , a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the put option. The put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company's estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put option agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's-length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. The estimated fair value of the put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The valuation of the put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. The Company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 . In determining the fair value of the put option on these dates, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 1.9 x. Changes in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2011, the Company reduced the value of the put option by $122 million , recording non-cash, non-operating income in the consolidated statement of operations. The decrease in the value of the put option reflected the overall decrease in Visa's P/E during fiscal 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2013 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. Visa call option agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATM's in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these events occurring is remote. The Framework Agreement. The relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed-upon circumstances. The base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately $143 million per year for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . This fee is eligible for adjustment annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the annual fee below $143 million . The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. In addition to the licenses, Visa provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed-upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa's systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. Under the Framework Agreement, the Company indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region; and Visa Europe likewise indemnifies the Company for such claims brought within Visa Europes region. However, Visa Europe has expressed an initial view that it is not obligated to indemnify the Company for any claim relating to the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. See Note 20Legal Matters . The Company continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify the Company for all such claims. The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be insignificant at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation.\" These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of a litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement and a loss sharing agreement. Covered litigation consists of: 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 ##TABLE_START  the Discover Litigation . Discover Financial Services Inc. v.

Inc. et al., Case No. CGC-04-436920 (Cal. Super.); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company's IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction and Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc. et al., Case No. CO4-4276 JSW (N.D. Cal.); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction. ##TABLE_END Litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the litigation escrow account: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 4,432  $ 2,857 Payments to settlement funds: (1)    Class plaintiffs (4,033 )   Individual plaintiffs (350 )   Payments to American Express   (140 ) Deposits into the litigation escrow account   1,715 Balance at September 30 $  $ 4,432 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The settlement with the class plaintiffs in these proceedings is subject to final court approval, which the Company cannot assure will be received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See Note 20Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END An accrual for the covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2013. See Note 20Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, by reducing the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, the Company will use 70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment in the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the retrospective responsibility plan.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The overall decrease in the Company's Level 1 assets primarily reflects payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters . Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Commercial paper and foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2013 . Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2013 . Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company has granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which is carried at fair value in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the put option was 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 $145 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 . Changes in fair value are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2Visa Europe . The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the put option. Earn-out related to PlaySpan acquisition. In connection with the PlaySpan acquisition, the Company initially recorded a liability of $24 million to reflect the fair value of a potential earn-out provision included in the purchase agreement. The liability was classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs, such as the likelihood of meeting certain future revenue targets and other milestones. The fair value of the earn-out was reduced to zero , reflecting payments made in full during fiscal 2013 , upon achieving certain revenue targets and other milestones. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis is not presented because the primary activities during fiscal 2013 and 2012 are already discussed above. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The Company recognized a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss related to these investments during fiscal 2013 , compared with a $2 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2012 and no impairment charges during fiscal 2011 . At September 30, 2013 and 2012 , these investments totaled $30 million and $86 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . Due to a change in the Company's relationship with one of its investees during fiscal 2013, the Company reclassified equity securities previously accounted for as an equity method investment, with a carrying value of $12 million , to long-term available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of this investment at September 30, 2013 was $99 million , resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax unrealized gain of $87 million in other comprehensive income. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, tradenames, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 7Intangible Assets, Net . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2013 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2013 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet but require disclosure of their fair values, including cash, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2013 , approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. 73 VISA INC.

Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2013 and 2012 , trading investment securities totaled $75 million and $66 million , respectively.

Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. On February 7, 2013 , the Company replaced the existing $500 million program with a new commercial paper program. Under the new program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the new program at September 30, 2013 . Credit facility. On January 31, 2013 , the Company entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. This credit facility, which expires on January 30, 2014 , replaced the Company's existing $3.0 billion credit facility, which would have expired on February 15, 2013 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in the new credit facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Company's class B and class C common stock and some of the Company's clients or affiliates of its clients. The new credit facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Visa also agreed to pay a commitment fee that fluctuates based on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.00% to 0.75% depending on the type of the loan, and the commitment fee is 0.05% . There were no borrowings under this facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants at September 30, 2013 . Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit pension plan benefits are based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Prior to January 1, 2011, employees hired before January 1, 2008 earned benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008, earned benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees began accruing benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased accruing benefits under any other formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Postretirement benefits plan. The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65. Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 ##TABLE_START (2)  Primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. ##TABLE_END The assumed annual rate of future increases in health benefits for the other postretirement benefits plan is 8.5% for fiscal 2014 . The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million .  Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2013 , pension plan asset allocations for the above categories were 71% , 26% and 3% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2013 and 2012 , including the impact of unsettled transactions: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measurements at September 30,   Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total            (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $          $  $ Collective investment funds     $   $        Corporate debt securities            Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies            Asset-backed securities         $  $   Equity securities            Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,055  $ ##TABLE_ENDLevel 1 assets. Cash equivalents (money market funds) and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. The fair values of government-sponsored and corporate debt securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefits plans, to invest in portfolios of stocks, bonds or other securities. A single collective investment fund, previously held by the pension plan, was ultimately invested in common stocks of companies in the SP 500 index, and as its own unit value was not directly observable, it was therefore classified as Level 2. 82 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2013 or 2012 . A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were immaterial. Cash Flows ##TABLE_START  Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits Actual employer contributions (in millions) $   $ 2012 $  $ Expected employer contributions    $  $ Expected benefit payments    $  $ 2015 $  $ 2016 $  $ 2017 $  $ 2018 $  $ 2019-2023 $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe lower contribution to pension benefits in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on the Company's plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012. Other Benefits The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, or 401(k) plan, that covers substantially all of its employees residing in the United States. Personnel costs included $44 million , $37 million and $34 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the 401(k) plan. The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to honor Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with Visa's operating regulations. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure increased to approximately $53.8 billion at September 30, 2013 , compared to $49.3 billion at September 30, 2012 , as a result of continued growth in the Company's business. Of these amounts, $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, 83 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 were covered by collateral. The decrease in covered collateral was primarily due to a change in the composition of clients required to post collateral based on the Company's settlement risk policies. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2013  September 30, 2012  (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $ Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,191  1,084 Guarantees 1,411  2,022 Total $ 3,724  $ 4,236 ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $1 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 . These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company maintains a rolling cash flow hedge program with the objective of reducing exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues derived from and payments made in non-functional currencies during the following twelve months. The aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program were $1.1 billion and $690 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The growth in the notional value of the Company's hedge program is mainly due to an increase in Visa's forecasted net exposure, combined with the Company's decision to hedge a larger percentage of those forecasted net exposures. As of September 30, 2013 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $23 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $13 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. 84 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $14 million , $16 million and $20 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $29 million pre-tax, to earnings during fiscal 2014. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2013 , the Company has posted and received collateral of $4 million and $14 million , respectively, with counterparties, which are included in prepaid and other current assets, and accrued liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2013 . Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2013  September 30, 2012  (in millions) United States $ 1,621  $ 1,539 International  Total $ 1,732  $ 1,634 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 54% , 55% and 56% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company.

As of September 30, 2013, the program had remaining authorized funds of $251 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2013 have been completed. In October 2013, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program. Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account in fiscal 2012. There were no deposits into the litigation escrow account in fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2012 (in millions, except per share and conversion rate data) July 2012  December 2011 Deposits under the retrospective responsibility plan $  $ 1,565 Effective price per share (1) $ 125.50  $ 101.75 Reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock  Conversion rate of class B common stock to class A common stock after deposits 0.4206  0.4254 As-converted class B common stock after deposits  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Effective price per share calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company's class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company's current certificate of incorporation. ##TABLE_END Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. 86 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2013 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and 125 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2013 and 2012 . Voting rights. Holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Holders of classes B and C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any consolidation, merger, combination or any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the holders of classes B and C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of classes B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends declared. In October 2013 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 3, 2013 , to all holders of record of the Companys classes A, B and C common stock as of November 15, 2013 . The Company declared and paid $864 million in dividends in fiscal 2013 at a quarterly rate of $0.33 per share.

The computation includes 2 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2013 and 3 million for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes less than 1 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2013 and 2012, and 2 million for fiscal 2011 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. ##TABLE_END Note 16Share-based Compensation  The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 59 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market 88 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost of $179 million , $147 million and $154 million , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START     Expected term (in years) (1)  6.08  6.02  5.16 Risk-free rate of return (2)  0.8 %  1.2 %  1.2 % Expected volatility (3)  29.3 %  34.9 %  33.4 % Expected dividend yield (4)  0.9 %  0.9 %  0.8 % Fair value per option granted  $ 39.03  $ 29.65  $ 27.50 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Based on a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the average of the Companys implied and historical volatility. As the Companys publicly-traded stock history is relatively short, historical volatility relies in part on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The relative weighting between Visa historical volatility and the historical volatility of the peer companies is based on the percentage of years Visa stock price information has been available since its initial public offering compared to the expected term. The expected volatilities ranged from 27% to 29% in fiscal 2013 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the Companys option activity for fiscal 2013 : ##TABLE_START  Options  Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at October 1, 2012 5,185,675  $ 59.46     Granted 579,318  $ 147.37     Forfeited (51,766 )  $ 109.35     Exercised (1,796,021 )  $ 58.56     Outstanding at September 30, 2013 3,917,206  $ 72.21  5.7  $466 Options exercisable at September 30, 2013 2,973,421  $ 57.74  4.8  $397 Options exercisable and expected to be vested at September 30, 2013 (2) 3,822,828  $ 71.08  5.6  $459 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2013 of $191.10 , less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Applies a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30, 2013 to estimate the number expected to vest in the future. ##TABLE_END For the options exercised during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the total intrinsic value was $176 million , $247 million and $77 million , respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $59 million , $86 million and $28 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2013 , there was $15 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years. 89 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $147.18 , $96.39 and $79.80 , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $146.18 , $96.97 and $79.97 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $98 million , $81 million and $55 million , respectively.

The performance condition is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $164.14 , $97.84 and $85.05 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2013 and 2012 vest approximately three years from the initial grant date. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2011 vest in two equal installments approximately two and three years from their respective grant dates. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2013 , there was $15 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 years. Note 17Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $94 million , $89 million and $76 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2013 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Marketing and sponsorships       Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDSelect sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. 91 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly in excess of the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with original terms ranging from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2013 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 2,450  $ 2,206  $ 1,802  $ 1,429  $  $ 1,447  $ 10,321 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 18Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2013 and 2012 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. Except as described below, there were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . In fiscal 2011 , the Company recognized $172 million in operating revenues from clients that were represented on the Company's board of directors. Due to changes in the board of directors made in January 2011, the Company's non-executive board members are now comprised exclusively of independent directors, and these clients are no longer considered related parties.

See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2013 and 2012 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2013 , the Company had $56 million state and $115 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2025 through 2031 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2013 , the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2 million and $21 million , respectively. The federal carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2029 . The state carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely . The Company also has federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $1 million , which do not expire . The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 differs from the rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  the decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result of changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2013 : ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011 . ##TABLE_END Current income taxes receivable were $142 million and $179 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Non-current income taxes receivable of $253 million were included in other assets at September 30, 2013 . See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2013 and 2012 , income taxes payable of $64 million and $58 million , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $453 million and $171 million , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 8Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to $3.8 billion at September 30, 2013 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2014, and may be extended through September 30, 2023, if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax incentive agreement is conditional upon certain employment and investment thresholds being met by the Company. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $158 million , $130 million and $111 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.24 , $0.19 and $0.16 in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2013 and 2012 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.0 billion and $679 million , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $1.0 billion and $679 million are $801 million and $537 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1 $  $ Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years (133 )  (445 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year  Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations (2 )  (1 ) Ending balance at September 30 $ 1,023  $ ##TABLE_END95 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 It is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income, and general and administrative expense, respectively, in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2013 , the Company recognized $9 million of interest expense, related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2012 and 2011 , the Company reversed $45 million , and recognized $7 million , of interest expense, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the Company reversed $4 million , $1 million and $2 million of penalties, respectively. At September 30, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had accrued interest of $29 million and $20 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $3 million and $7 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.  In September 2012, the IRS completed the examination of the Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns with no significant adjustments. The statute of limitations for these years is expected to expire in December of 2013. The IRS began the examination of the Company's fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns in fiscal 2013. The Company's California fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the federal and California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 to 2011 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. The Company has filed or will file notices of objection against these assessments and believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 20Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2013  Fiscal 2012  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 4,386  $ Provision for unsettled legal matters  4,100 Interest accretion on settled matters   Payments on unsettled matters (1) (4,033 )   Payments on settled matters (351 )  (140 ) Balance at September 30 $  $ 4,386 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  On December 10, 2012, the Company paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict ##TABLE_END 96 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 litigation. The settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval, which the Company cannot assure will be received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See further discussion below. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . An accrual for the covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The Company recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012, which increased its total reserve for the covered litigation from $285 million to $4.4 billion . During fiscal 2013, the Company paid approximately $4.4 billion from the litigation escrow account into settlement funds pursuant to settlement agreements with individual and class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation. The Attridge Litigation  On December 8, 2004, a complaint was filed in California state court on behalf of an alleged class of consumers asserting claims against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard. The claims in this action, Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al. , allege that Visa ' s bylaw 2.10(e) and MasterCard ' s Competitive Programs Policy, which prohibited their respective members from issuing American Express or Discover cards, constitute unlawful restraints of trade under California ' s Unfair Competition Law and the Cartwright Act. On May 19, 2006, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiff ' s Cartwright Act claims with prejudice but allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his Unfair Competition Law claims, which seek restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys ' fees and costs. On December 14, 2007, the plaintiff amended his complaint to add Visa Inc. as a defendant. In the separate \" Indirect Purchaser\" Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , also pending in California state court (see below), Visa entered into a settlement agreement on September 14, 2009 which potentially could have had the effect of releasing the claims asserted in the Attridge case, subject to the ruling of the Attridge court. On August 23, 2010, final approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement was granted. The plaintiff in Attridge and others appealed the final approval order. On February 15, 2011, the court ordered that the Attridge case be stayed until 30 days following the final resolution of the appeals in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases. On January 9, 2012, the appeals court reversed the approval of the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases settlement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. The parties in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases subsequently agreed upon a revised written settlement agreement, which was finally approved by the court on April 11, 2013. Objectors have filed notices of appeal in those cases and the Attridge case. On September 18, 2013, in light of the proceedings in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , the Attridge case was stayed until April 11, 2014. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Beginning in May 2005, approximately fifty-five complaints (all but thirteen of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International, and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa ' s and MasterCard ' s purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their \" no surcharge\" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. On October 19, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on January 29, 2009 which, together with the thirteen complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa ' s reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and 97 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. On July 1, 2007, as part of the retrospective responsibility plan, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain member financial institutions of Visa U.S.A. On February 7, 2011, Visa entered into an omnibus agreement that confirmed and memorialized the signatories ' intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company ' s retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On October 19, 2012, the Company and the individual plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated with the MDL (the \" Individual Plaintiffs \" ) signed a settlement agreement to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs ' claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan on October 29, 2012. On November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the Individual Plaintiffs ' claims with prejudice. In addition, on October 19, 2012, Visa Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the class plaintiffs ' claims. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include, among other terms: ##TABLE_START  A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion , to be paid from the Company's previously funded litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan, see  Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have been paid to issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time. The eight month period for the reduction would begin within 60 days after completion of the court-ordered period during which individual class members may opt out of this settlement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances, subject to a cap and a level playing field with other general purpose card competitors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Agreement that the Company will meet with merchant buying groups that seek to negotiate interchange rates collectively. ##TABLE_END The district court entered the preliminary approval order of the Settlement Agreement on November 27, 2012. On November 27, 2012, certain objectors filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary approval order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On December 10, 2012, the court of appeals entered an order deferring briefing for the appeal until after the district court enters an order of final approval and final judgment with respect to the settlement, or otherwise concludes the matters by entry of a final judgment. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes thereafter objected to the settlement, opted out of the damages portion of the class settlement, and/or are seeking to opt out of the rules portion of the class settlement. Details of merchants who have filed an opt-out claim may be found below (see \" Interchange Opt-out Litigation\" below). Certain competitors and other interested parties have also objected to the class settlement, including Discover, which filed a motion to intervene on May 28, 2013. Discover sought, among other things, to object to the Settlement Agreement and to file a proposed complaint challenging certain aspects of the Settlement Agreement as a restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On August 16, 2013, defendants responded to Discover's objections. On September 12, 2013, the district court held a hearing on the motion for final approval of the class settlement. Until the Settlement Agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs ' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. Under the Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement, the defendants are entitled to receive payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out (the \" takedown payments\"). The class administrator has filed an amended report stating that the administrator had received 7,953 requests to opt out of the settlement, some of which may include multiple merchants. Based on the payment card sales volume of merchants requesting to opt out, in the event of final approval, the defendants will receive takedown payments equal to an amount calculated as 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund. Visa ' s portion of the takedown payments is calculated to be approximately $1.1 billion , and would be deposited into the litigation escrow account. Interchange Opt-out Litigation Beginning in May 2013, approximately twenty opt-out cases have been filed by hundreds of merchants in various federal district courts, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A similar case has been filed by a merchant in Texas state court. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments, and one of the cases seeks an injunction against the fixed acquirer network fee. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. All but one of the cases originally filed in federal court either were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and have been assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. Visa is seeking to transfer that one case to MDL 1720, and the plaintiff in that case has filed a motion opposing such transfer. Visa has also removed the Texas state court case to federal court and is seeking to transfer it to MDL 1720; the plaintiff in that case has opposed such transfer. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 will be covered litigation for purposes of the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . On May 24, 2013, Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the MDL class settlement. On June 10, 2013, Visa filed a similar complaint in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Both complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs may seek damages under the MDL class settlement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its \" honor all cards\" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. Both cases have been assigned to the same district court judge presiding over MDL 1720. Other Litigation \" Indirect Purchaser\" Actions 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 Complaints were filed on behalf of consumers in nineteen different states and the District of Columbia against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard (and, in California, Visa International). The complaints allege, among other things, that Visa U.S.A.'s \" honor all cards\" rule and a similar MasterCard rule violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws, and common law. The claims in these class actions asserted that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs seek money damages and injunctive relief. Visa U.S.A. has been successful in the majority of these cases, as courts in eighteen jurisdictions have granted Visa U.S.A. ' s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaints. In California, in the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , the court dismissed claims brought under the Cartwright Act, but denied a similar motion with respect to Unfair Competition Law claims for unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices. On October 3, 2008, the parties agreed to confidential settlement terms to resolve the dispute. A written settlement agreement executed on September 14, 2009, was submitted to the court for approval. After the parties amended the settlement agreement in certain respects, the court entered an order granting final approval on August 23, 2010. The plaintiff in Attridge , who had filed objections to the settlement, filed a notice of appeal from the final approval order, as did other objectors to the settlement. The amount of the settlement is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. On January 9, 2012, the Court of Appeal of the State of California reversed the judgment approving the settlement agreement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. The parties subsequently agreed upon a revised written settlement agreement. On April 11, 2013, the court entered an order finally approving the settlement and entered judgment. Objectors to the settlement have filed notices of appeal. Vale Canjeable In November and December of 2006, Vale Canjeable Ticketven, C.A. filed two separate actions against Todoticket 2004, C.A., and Visa International. In the first action, the plaintiff was granted an injunction on November 29, 2006 prohibiting the defendants' use of the Vale mark in Venezuelas food voucher market (the Injunction). In the second action, plaintiffs sought damages for trademark infringement (the Trademark Action). The Injunction and Trademark Action have been litigated extensively through the Venezuelan court system. On June 5, 2013, the Supreme Tribunal's Commercial Chamber dismissed the Trademark Action in its entirety and invalidated the Injunction effective immediately. On August 7, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the Supreme Tribunal's Constitutional Chamber enjoin or annul the Commercial Chamber's judgment, and either rule directly on the merits of the Trademark Action or resubmit the cases to the Commercial Chamber for a new decision on the merits. Visa filed an opposition to the plaintiff's motion on October 29, 2013. European Competition Proceedings European Commission. On April 3, 2009, the European Commission ( \" EC\") issued a Statement of Objections ( \" SO\") to Visa Europe, Visa International and Visa Inc. alleging a breach of European competition law. Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with the Statement of Objections on June 1, 2009. The SO alleged a breach of Article 81 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the European Economic Area Agreement (the \"EEA Agreement\"). The SO was directed to Visa Inc. and Visa International with respect to the \" honor all cards \" rule, the \" no-surcharge\" rule, and certain consumer card interchange fee practices. On April 26, 2010, Visa Europe announced an agreement with the EC, subject to public consultation, to end the proceedings with respect to Visa Europe ' s debit interchange fees. After public consultation, on December 8, 2010, the EC concluded that the proposed agreement with Visa Europe addressed its competition concerns, made the agreement legally binding upon Visa Europe, and closed its investigation with regard to interchange fees for consumer debit card transactions. On July 31, 2012, the EC announced a supplementary Statement of Objections ( \" SSO\") that was sent to Visa Europe concerning interchange for consumer credit card transactions. On March 8, 2013, Visa Inc. and Visa International received a redacted version of the SSO. The SSO alleges a breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Among other things, the SSO asserts claims jointly against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International, objecting to domestic, cross-border, and inter-regional interchange, Visa Europe ' s rules relating to cross-border acquiring, and Visa Europe  s point of sale rules. 100 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 The SSO also announces the EC ' s intention to impose fines. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. Visa Europe has offered commitments addressing domestic interchange, cross-border interchange within Europe, cross-border acquiring within Europe, and other Visa Europe rules. The EC will consider whether to accept those commitments after a period of public comment. U.K. Merchant Litigation . On August 2, 2013, Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with claims filed in the High Court of Justice Queen's Bench Division Commercial Court in London on behalf of eleven merchants in the supermarket, clothing, and other retail business. Visa Europe is also named in the case. The claimants seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct relating to U.K. domestic, Irish domestic, and intra-EEA interchange fees for credit and debit cards. The claimants also assert that the alleged anticompetitive effects of interchange fees are reinforced by Visa Europe's \" honor all cards\" and \" no discrimination\" rules and rules limiting cross-border issuing and acquiring. On October 16, 2013, Visa Inc. and Visa International were served with a similar claim by a twelfth merchant that is represented by the same counsel as the other eleven merchants. The twelve merchants seek damages exceeding $825 million . Previously, on March 22, 2013, Visa Inc. learned that counsel for a separate group of merchant plaintiffs threatened to file litigation against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. On March 28, 2013, Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International entered into (1) a standstill agreement with respect to those merchants' claims, and (2) a costs agreement, which preserved the then-current recoverability rules in the United Kingdom. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, no claims have yet been filed and the full scope of the claims is not yet known. Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International in connection with the European Competition Proceedings, in our opinion, including payment of any fines that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has expressed an \"initial\" view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for any claim in the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. Visa Inc. continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify for all such claims, and has been in discussions with Visa Europe to resolve this issue. While the parties are not currently in non-binding arbitration, both parties have initiated the executive engagement aspect of the dispute resolution procedure contemplated by the Framework Agreement to resolve their dispute regarding this indemnification issue. Canadian Competition Proceedings Competition Bureau . On December 15, 2010, following a civil inquiry regarding interchange and certain Visa policies related to merchant acceptance practices, the Commissioner of Competition filed a Notice of Application against Visa Canada Corporation ( \" Visa Canada\") and MasterCard. The proceeding challenged certain Visa policies regarding merchant acceptance practices, including Visa  s \" no-surcharge\" and \" honor all cards\" policies under the Competition Act. The hearing before the Competition Tribunal on the merits of the case was held from May 8, 2012 through June 21, 2012. On July 23, 2013, the Competition Tribunal ruled in favor of Visa Canada and MasterCard, dismissing the Commissioner of Competition's challenges to Visa's \"no-surcharge\" and \"honor all cards\" policies. The Competition Tribunal found that the Commissioner failed to establish that either policy constituted resale price maintenance under Section 76 of the Competition Act. The Commissioner did not file an appeal prior to the deadline of September 30, 2013. Merchant Litigation . Beginning in December 2010, a number of purported civil follow-on cases to the Competition Bureau ' s proceeding were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and ten financial institutions on behalf of purported classes of merchants and others that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard. The purported class action lawsuits allege conduct contrary to Section 45 of the Competition Act and also assert claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiffs allege that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCard's respective \" no-surcharge \" and \" honor all cards \" policies had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. The lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. 101 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 In the British Columbia lawsuit, a hearing on class certification commenced on April 22, 2013 and concluded on May 1, 2013. The lawsuits in Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta are being held in abeyance pending further proceedings in the British Columbia lawsuit. In Saskatchewan, applications for a stay of proceedings and carriage of the lawsuits have been filed. Dynamic Currency Conversion On February 4, 2013, following an investigation into Visa ' s policies relating to the provision of Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (\"ACCC \" ) commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., V.W.P.L., and Visa AP (Australia) Pty Limited alleging that certain Visa policies related to the provision of DCC services contravened Australian competition law. DCC refers to conversion from one currency to another, either of the price of goods or services by the merchant, or of cash withdrawals by an ATM. Among other things, the ACCC alleges that: (1) from May 2010 to October 2010, Visa prohibited DCC services with respect to transactions on Visa international payment cards conducted at Australian merchant outlets that had not previously been conducting DCC transactions; and (2) from at least May 2007, Visa prohibited DCC services with respect to cash withdrawals at Australian ATMs on Visa international payment cards. The ACCC seeks declaratory relief and a monetary penalty. On June 6, 2013, Visa filed its response to the ACCC's allegations. On August 8, 2013, the ACCC filed an amended claim which, among other things, added Visa International as a respondent. On October 4, 2013, Visa filed its response to the amended claim. The potential amount of any penalty cannot be estimated at this time. Data Pass Litigation On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in federal district court in Connecticut. The plaintiff claims, among other things, that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were deceived into also incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the alleged unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction ( \" data pass \" ), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. Visa allegedly aided and abetted the conduct of the other defendants. Plaintiff seeks certification of a class of persons and entities whose credit card or debit card data was improperly accessed by Webloyalty.com since October 1, 2008, and seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. On December 23, 2010, Webloyalty.com, GameStop, and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Korean Fair Trade Commission Following a complaint lodged by a Visa client, in July 2011 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (\"KFTC\") initiated an investigation into Visa  s requirements for the processing of international transactions over VisaNet. The KFTC has the authority to issue an injunction or a fine. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A., and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa ' s rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek damages \" in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling, \" injunctive relief, and attorneys  fees. On January 10, 2012, plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint against the same defendants, also asserting that the ATM access fee rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs request treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys ' fees. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action ( Stoumbos ) was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court, and were later combined into a 102 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2013 single amended complaint ( Mackmin ). The amended complaint challenges the same ATM access fee rules and names Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. Both Stoumbos and Mackmin purport to represent classes and sub-classes of consumers in claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and also allege claims under antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes in certain states and the District of Columbia. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief, attorneys ' fees, treble damages, and restitution where available under state law. On January 30, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the defendant financial institutions filed motions to dismiss the complaints in the National ATM Council class action and the consumer class actions. On February 13, 2013, the court granted the motion to dismiss and dismissed the cases without prejudice. On March 12, 2013, plaintiffs in the National ATM Council class action and the consumer class actions moved for an order altering or amending the court's February 13, 2013 order to provide that (1) the complaints (as opposed to the cases) are dismissed without prejudice, and (2) plaintiffs may move to amend their complaints. On April 15, 2013, plaintiffs in the National ATM Council class action and the Stoumbos case moved for leave to file amended complaints. On April 18, 2013, plaintiffs in the Mackmin case moved for leave to file an amended complaint. Defendants filed responses opposing the motions on the grounds that they are not procedurally proper and would be futile in any event. On April 24, 2013, the court ordered the defendants to file further detailed responses, addressing futility in particular. Briefing on the motions is complete. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \" Division \" ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or \" CID, \" to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter On September 21, 2012, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \" Bureau \" ) requested that Visa provide on a voluntary basis documents and information regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section 920(b)(1)(B) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693o-2, and Regulation II, 12 C.F.R.  235.7(b) (commonly known as the Durbin Amendment and regulations). The request focuses on information related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. The revenue generated by the PIN Debit Gateway Service is not material to the Companys financial statements. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau and responding to its information requests. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau On February 7, 2013, Visa received a letter from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( \" CFPB \" ) seeking documents and information, on a voluntary basis, regarding Visa's practices with respect to the conversion of U.S. cardholder foreign transactions from foreign currency into U.S. dollars. On March 20, 2013, Visa met with the CFPB and provided information and materials in response to the requests. Visa is continuing to cooperate with the CFPB ' s inquiry. Note 21Subsequent Events In October 2013 , the Companys board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . In October 2013 , the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.40 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . 103 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) The following tables show selected quarterly operating results for each quarter and full year of fiscal 2013 and 2012 for the Company:  ##TABLE_START  Quarter Ended (unaudited)  Fiscal Year Visa Inc.

The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years. See Overview in Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan.

See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END 104 ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2013 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2013 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2013 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2013 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business General Business Developments Visa Inc., which we refer to as Visa or the Company, is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. It also offers fraud protection for account holders and rapid payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution clients. Visa Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa Canada Corporation and Inovant LLC became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe Limited remains owned and governed by its European member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of Visa Inc. Visa Inc. completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in March 2008. Since fiscal 2010, we have completed several acquisitions to accelerate the growth of Visa's digital, eCommerce and mobile commerce offerings. These include: CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants; PlaySpan Inc., a leading provider of digital goods transactions in online games, digital media and social networks; and Fundamo, a leading provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies. General business developments in fiscal 2014 included the following: ##TABLE_START  Product innovation . Visas fundamental approach to innovation focuses on: (i) supporting an evolving payments ecosystem; (ii) enhancing Visas network security through innovation; and (iii) developing new platforms, products and services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START i. Evolving payments ecosystem .  By providing new and existing financial institution clients and partners greater access to Visas network and payment capabilities, Visa is contributing to the evolving payments ecosystem. In 2014, Visa announced a developer center, which will enable software developers, financial institutions and new entrants to more easily access Visa payment capabilities through programing interfaces and software developer kits beginning in 2015. We also launched the Visa Ready program to enable our partners to quickly deploy Visa-compliant devices, software and services to consumers, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of innovation in payments. Finally, we established an innovation center at our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to facilitate collaboration among Visa, our financial institution clients, other partners and the Bay Area technology community to develop the next generation of global commerce solutions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ii. Network security through innovation .  In 2014, Visa made strides to enhance its network security by implementing the following programs: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Visa Token Service : Visa Token Service replaces account numbers with digital tokens for online and mobile payments. This benefits merchants and issuers by removing sensitive account information from online and mobile payments and significantly reduces fraud risk. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. EMV-chip payment technology : Visa is addressing fraud at the physical point-of-sale by working with merchants and issuers in the United States to introduce EMV-chip payment technology. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START c. Fraud and data analytics : As an industry leader in payment security, we enhanced our real-time data analytics capabilities. When combined with Visas centralized network structure, these capabilities allow financial institution clients and merchants to identify and address fraud. ##TABLE_END 4 ##TABLE_START iii. New platforms, products and services . Visa continues to develop new platforms, products and services to benefit financial institution clients, merchants and consumers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Visa Checkout : Visa Checkout is a fast, simple and intuitive payment experience that allows consumers to pay for goods online, on any device, in just a few clicks.  This service is presently available to eCommerce merchants and financial institutions in the United States, Canada and Australia. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. Visa payWave :  With Visa payWave technology, consumers are able to pay for products and services via smart phone and by using their contactless cards at physical retailers. Visa Direct : ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START c. Visa Direct :  Visa Direct simplifies the way people send and receive money both domestically and across borders. In 2014, this service had a rapid growth in use, particularly in emerging markets where there is a high demand for person-to-person payments. Visa Direct is offered through financial institutions, and takes advantage of Visas global network of 14,000 financial institutions and 2.2 billion accounts to facilitate fast and secure money transfers. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Regulation . Rules were implemented in the United States during 2011 and 2012 with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), which regulates, among other things, debit interchange reimbursements rates, the availability of debit networks, financial institutions' and merchants' choices among these networks, and transaction routing. As a result, we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients. On March 21, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed a district court ruling invalidating these rules. The appeals court agreed with the Federal Reserve, except for a single issue related to the interchange cost calculation which was referred back to the Federal Reserve for reconsideration. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiff merchants filed a petition for review of the appeals court's decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of a portion of the rules pertaining to the interchange cost calculation. The current rules remain in place while the case is ongoing. See Government Regulation below. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014 developments in Russia . U.S. and EU sanctions targeting Russias financial sector in response to the conflict in Ukraine restrict the ability of U.S. based companies, including payments networks, to supply services to certain Russian individuals and companies. On September 12, the United States, in coordination with the European Union, broadened existing sanctions on Russian financial institutions, expanded sanctions in Russias energy sector, and targeted additional energy and defense-related entities. In the financial sector, the U.S. government has imposed sectoral sanctions on the six largest Russian state banks. These sectoral measures restrict the maturity period for new debt issued by the six Russian state banks to 30 days. In 2014, they have not restricted Visas ability to supply electronic payment services to Russian banks. However, in response to the U.S. and EU sanctions, the Russian government has modified its National Payments Systems laws that will in essence require international payments networks to process Russian domestic transactions on the government-owned payment system in 2015. See Government Regulation  Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions below. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Interchange multidistrict litigation settlement . In fiscal 2014, we obtained final court approval of a settlement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, subject to any appeals. We believe that this settlement supports the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States. A number of objectors to the settlement, however, have appealed the final judgment, and a number of opt-out cases have been filed by merchants. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. ##TABLE_END Nature of Operations Visa's mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce. We operate an open-loop payments network, VisaNet, through which Visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between: (i) issuers  financial institutions that issue Visa-branded cards or payment products to account holders, and (ii) acquirers  financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. The issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders. 5 Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. The acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. A typical Visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her Visa-branded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the acquirer and routed through VisaNet to the issuer for authorization. Following authorization, a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer. The following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on VisaNet. Our operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues, and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. ##TABLE_START  Service revenues. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Service revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues. Data processing revenues  consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily generated from the number of transactions we process. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues. International transaction revenues consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Client incentives. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card ##TABLE_END 6 and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. U.S. dollar settlements with our financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. In order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network, we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The settlement indemnification applies to the amount of Visa payment transactions that have occurred, but have not yet settled. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. We have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years . Core Products and Services Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: (i) pay now with debit; (ii) pay ahead with prepaid; or (iii) pay later with credit products. Visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital, eCommerce and mobile products and services. These services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. ##TABLE_START  Debit . Our debit payment solutions support issuers' payment products that draw on demand deposit accounts, such as checking accounts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Prepaid. Our prepaid payment solutions support issuers' payment products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing account holders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Credit. Our credit payment solutions support issuers' deferred payment and customized financing products. ##TABLE_END Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added services, including information products, such as risk scoring and loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our network. Visa's processing services continue to expand to address the needs of all participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa Debit Processing Services (\"DPS\"). Merchant gateway services provided through our CyberSource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online. DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. These and other services support our financial institution clients and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network. Processing Infrastructure VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the United States, which are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement among Visa Inc., Visa Europe Limited and others, Visa Europe's processing centers in the United Kingdom must maintain interoperability with Visa's synchronized system. Intelligent access points around the world complete the VisaNet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. 7 Visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the United States and internationally, including those we added with our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan. These facilities enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders, our financial institution clients and our processing partners. Intellectual Property Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our family of Visa marks, our Plus mark and our Dove design mark, are important to our business. Through agreements with our financial institution clients, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. Seasonality We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. Working Capital Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Concentration of Business and Financial Information About Geographic Areas For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business included elsewhere in this report. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment. These include: ##TABLE_START  paper-based payments, principally cash and checks; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid and private-label products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  eCommerce and mobile payments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house (\"ACH\"), and electronic data interchange. ##TABLE_END Based on payments volume, total volume and number of transactions, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network widely used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payments network competitors for calendar year 2013: ##TABLE_START Company (1)  Payments Volume  Total Volume  Total Transactions  Cards   (billions)  (billions)  (billions)  (millions) Visa Inc. (2)  $ 4,383  $ 6,970  89.7  2,219 MasterCard (3)  $ 2,991  $ 4,103  52.7  1,281 American Express (3)  $  $  6.4  Discover (3)  $  $  2.2  JCB (3)  $  $  1.9  Diners Club (3)  $  $  0.2  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table because Visa is not allowed to compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. Visa Europe data are not included. ##TABLE_END 8 ##TABLE_START (3)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB, and Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1037 (March 2014) and Discover data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1034 (February 2014). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.  Certain general purpose payments network competitors are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. Our competitors also have leading positions in certain countries. For example, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. ##TABLE_END In the global debit network market segment, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands, including STAR, NYCE and PULSE in the United States, EFTPOS in Australia, NETS in Singapore and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands provide the primary network, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume. The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. We may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model. The emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal and Alipay are examples. These providers compete with us directly in some cases, yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours.  We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience, interoperability, accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate. We do so by partnering with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. Employees At September 30, 2014, we employed approximately 9,500 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Government Regulation Interchange reimbursement fees . We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the United States and many other geographies. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve implemented new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, setting a cap on the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions. These rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues. As a result, we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients. In July 2013, a federal court invalidated the newly implemented rules, finding that the Federal Reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction, regardless of authorization method. On March 21, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's ruling and agreed with the Federal Reserve, except for a single issue related to the interchange cost calculation which was referred back to the Federal Reserve for reconsideration. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiff merchants filed a petition for review of the appeals court's decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of a portion of the rules pertaining to the interchange cost calculation. The current rules remain in place while the case is ongoing. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business and Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview included elsewhere in this report. Certain jurisdictions outside the United States also regulate debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates. In some jurisdictions, such as India, the governing authorities have begun to regulate other rates or practices such as the 9 merchant discount rate. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Network exclusivity and routing . We have historically had agreements under which issuers received incentives if they agreed to issue Visa-branded cards or payment products that are processed through VisaNet. Historically, issuers of some debit products outside the United States have chosen to include only our network. These various practices are referred to as network exclusivity. The Dodd-Frank Act limits the issuers' and our ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the U.S. debit network market segment. Other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business included elsewhere in this report. U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The CFPBs future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers, acquirers, consumers and merchants. No-surcharge rules . We have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their Visa-branded card or payment product instead of other means. As part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation, however, Visa has agreed to modify our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances. See  Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Ten U.S. states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the United States have taken steps to prohibit surcharging. In October 2013, a federal court granted declaratory relief and issued an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of New York's no-surcharge law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law section 518, in a case brought by five retailers challenging the constitutionality of that law. Data protection and information security . In accordance with governing law, we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstances, to provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council periodically reviews aspects of our operations in the United States to examine our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctioned countries . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We have policies, procedures, systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions. Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions . Our market reach remains limited by certain governments' influence on their domestic payments competition and/or their protection of domestic issuers or payments network processors. Regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries. For instance, in response to the U.S. and EU sanctions, the Russian government has modified their National Payments Systems laws to require, among other things: (i) on-shore processing for transactions between Russian cardholders and merchants; (ii) a material guarantee deposit and significant fines for domestic transactions not processed by a nationally significant payment system; and (iii) the creation of a new domestic payment processor. As a result, international payment brands are mandated to process Russian domestic transactions on the government-owned payment system. Regulation of Internet, mobile payment and other types of transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants, including our financial institution clients and us, to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions. For example, U.S. federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify Internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such 10 transaction requests. State governments have been interested in the potential blocking of Internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol, or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such Internet purchases. Implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us, and may reduce merchant acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products for these purchases. The U.S. Congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including mobile payment transactions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients' ability to offer existing products and services, extend credit via payment cards and products, and offer new types of payment programs, which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and overall payments volume. We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the United States and many other geographies. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act has limited our ability to establish default debit interchange reimbursement rates. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Interchange reimbursement rates have also become subject to continued or increased government regulation elsewhere, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates. In certain jurisdictions, interchange reimbursement rates, our operating regulations and related practices, are subject to continuing or increased government regulation. These jurisdictions include, for example, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Europe, India, Mexico, Malaysia, Russia and South Africa. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. It may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. In addition, as a result of such regulations, we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers. In certain instances, 11 some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the level of Visa interchange reimbursement rate, leading merchants not to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems or forms of payment. In addition, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the rates that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs. For these reasons, additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may make Visa-branded cards and payment products less desirable, reduce our overall transaction volumes, and have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network, may decrease the number of transactions we process, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . In order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into VisaNet, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, Visa's operating regulations require that all authorization, clearance and settlement of international transactions must be done through VisaNet. These are commonly referred to as routing rules. The Dodd-Frank Act already limits our and issuers' ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . Additional regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process. In order to retain that transaction volume, we may reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers, acquirers or merchants. Any of these outcomes could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. On March 21, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed a district court ruling invalidating these rules and agreed with the Federal Reserve, except for a single issue related to the interchange cost calculation which was referred back to the Federal Reserve for reconsideration. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiff merchants filed a petition for review of the appeals court's decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of a portion of the rules pertaining to the interchange cost calculation. The rules , described above , remain in place while the case is ongoing. These regulations have adversely affected our U.S. debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing, reduced the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminished associated revenues. Although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the regulations as issued in October 2011, our business could continue to be affected, including if the Federal Reserve issues new regulations. These pressures have arisen through various channels. Other debit networks may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reductions to win routing preference, which in turn puts more pressure on the business terms offered by Visa. A number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some clients elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks or reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs, while others 12 imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other debit networks based on lower cost or other factors. Other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. These actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to issuers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules. Our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, the regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. New laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings . Regulators around the world increasingly note each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Dodd-Frank Act and the European Union Commission ' s draft interchange regulation are developments with such potential. See Note 20  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report . Similarly, new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments. The risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings. As a result, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, network exclusivity, preferred routing, dynamic currency conversion, point of sale transaction rules and practices, and operating regulations that may differ from country to country or by product offering. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions. In addition, adverse developments, regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands . Governments in some countries provide resources to or protection for their domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country. In China, for example, UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. In light of the U.S. and EU sanctions targeting Russia  s financial sector, the Russian government has modified its National Payments Systems laws that require, among other things, the creation of a national payment system and local storage of certain transaction data. As a result, international payment brands could be mandated to process Russian domestic transactions on the government-owned payment system. Additional laws or mandates may be put into place without sufficient notice which may increase our costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded cards issued or processed in Russia. These actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there. These actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets. Although we are trying to effect change in these countries, we may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands. 13 Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of Visa-branded cards issued, our payments volume and our revenues . Privacy, data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions who have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices. Our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. These measures may increase Visa  s and our clients' costs, decrease the number of Visa-branded cards our clients issue, and decrease our payments volume and revenue. Evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us, leading to increased costs, decreased payments volume and a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for further growth and overall business . Regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly. Examples include: ##TABLE_START  Data protection and information security . Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients around the globe are subject to similar requirements under privacy laws and bank regulatory regimes. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulatory compliance . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. An increase in the number of OFAC sanctions, such as those issued in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, may affect the issuance, acceptance, reputation, and revenues of Visa-branded cards. In addition, some of our clients located outside of the United States may not be subject to these same laws, regulations and sanctions, and, as a result, may initiate transactions that, while permissible in their countries, are not permissible in the United States. We have policies, procedures, systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions. Regulation of the price of credit . Many jurisdictions in which Visa-branded cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act of 2009 in the United States and other proposed regulations under it, and proposed changes to regulations under the Truth in Lending Act of 1968.  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Increased CFPB scrutiny. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\") has primary oversight and rule-writing authority over consumer financial products in the United States, including the regulations that apply to credit, debit, and prepaid cards. Regulatory changes that impose new requirements on or restrict the terms under which financial products can be offered could increase our clients  costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded payment cards our clients issue. The CFPB also has supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority over certain financial institutions , their service providers,  and other entities , which could include us due to our processing of credit, debit, and prepaid transactions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Increased central bank oversight. Several central banks around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry, in some cases considering designating them as \"systemically important payment systems\" or \"critical infrastructure.\" Any such oversight may lead to additional regulations by central banks and other government regulators. These could include new settlement procedures, cyber security requirements or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for financial institution client participation and merchant access to our payments system. ##TABLE_END 14 ##TABLE_START  Safety and soundness regulation . Recent banking regulations enacted in the United States and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less likely to become an issuer of Visa-branded cards, because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulation of Internet and mobile transactions . Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using Visa-branded cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the laws that govern the transactions, their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property rights. In addition, new mobile regulatory requirements could impact our business practices. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Money transfer regulations. As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. state money transfer regulations, as well as international payments laws, which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance costs. ##TABLE_END Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Our programs and policies are designed to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, sanctions regulations, and other laws, and we continue to enhance them. But, as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal money penalties, litigation and damage to our global brand reputation. The impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which Visa-branded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept Visa-branded cards. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our overall business, revenues, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation Risks Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments . Our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation, which is described in Note 3  Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. The retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our IPO and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings). They also include a loss sharing agreement, a judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended. In addition, our U.S. financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. The principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates. See Note 20  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report . Beginning in 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain Visa member financial institutions. We refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation or MDL 1720. Among other allegations, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa's setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in MDL 1720 seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages would be trebled. The allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011, and amended August 26, 2014. See Note 3  Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Visa's portion of a settlement or judgment 15 covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan. We signed settlement agreements in connection with MDL 1720, which included an agreement to pay approximately $4.0 billion to the class plaintiffs. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. A number of merchants have filed opt-out cases in various federal district courts. All of the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that MDL 1720 includes: (i) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings; and (ii) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 are covered litigation for purposes of the retrospective responsibility plan. It is possible that some opt-out cases may not be transferred or otherwise included in MDL 1720 and will not be covered litigation . Failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent. The retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation. The plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our IPO that are transferred for pre-trial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation. See  If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages . In addition, non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business. See  Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability . Therefore, even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of, and judgments in, the covered litigation, it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation. If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages . Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition/antitrust law, consumer protection law or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 20  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. Particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers, private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business. If we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit, such as the U.S. or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be significant. See Note 20  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material pending or future legal proceedings, we may have to pay substantial damages.  This could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition and could even cause us to become insolvent. Limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability . Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. We may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation. For example, under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, we have agreed, among other things, to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances. These and other settlements of, or judgments in, past, pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we charge, revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use Visa-branded payment products, or 16 make other modifications to our business. These modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume, revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws applicable to us, could materially increase our tax payments . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material, adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19  Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. We have limited rights to enforce our agreement with Visa Europe, which includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities . The relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by the Framework Agreement. In the event Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations under the Framework Agreement, our remedies are limited. We are unable to terminate the agreement even upon Visa Europe's material, uncured breach. We also have a call option to acquire Visa Europe, which can be triggered only under extremely limited circumstances. See Note 2  Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Under the Framework Agreement, we may be required to indemnify Visa Europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions giving rise to such claims. The indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International Service Association (Visa International) in connection with the European Competition Proceedings, in our opinion, including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed us of its position that it is not obligated to indemnify us or Visa International for any claim in the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in either the European Commission matter or the filed or unfiled claims in the U.K. Merchant Litigation. If Visa Europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity, we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 20  Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Business Risks The intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits . Pressure on client pricing poses challenges for our business. In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their Visa-branded card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments. We have continued to increase the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the United States. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where our products co-reside with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Dodd-Frank Act have also increased our use of incentives. See  The Dodd-Frank Act may continue to have a material, adverse impact on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . As a result, the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or unprofitable, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly, in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms. We may also 17 have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. While we may implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, we may not be successful in our efforts or they may not offset the decreases in our revenues. Intense competition in our industry may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth to suffer . The global payments industry is intensely competitive and, as a result, our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks, electronic, eCommerce, and mobile payments, as well as traditional general purpose card networks. In addition, our open-loop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closed-loop payment systems. The Dodd-Frank Act increased this competitive pressure. Some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resources. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services than we do, including more innovative ones. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. These include domestic networks in the United States, China, Canada and Australia. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. Traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients' long-term commitments to our products increased with the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. We do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice without significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of these clients. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 13  Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with, impair or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, eCommerce payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new players and intermediaries in the payments value chain may redirect transactions or steer account holders away from our network; or ##TABLE_END 18 ##TABLE_START  new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industry-wide solutions and standards set by organizations such as EMVCo, related to EMV-chip payment technology, tokenization, or other technologies. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Disintermediation from the payments value chain could harm our business . Our position in the payments value chain is key to our business. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. Regulatory actions such as the Dodd-Frank Act may provide them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in us losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth . Additional consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors or with one of our competitors directly. This could result in the acquired financial institution's Visa business shifting to a competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. Additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of new and existing clients, who may seek and obtain greater pricing discounts or other incentives from us. In addition, more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and prospects for future growth. Merchants' continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation, regulation, regulatory enforcement, incentive arrangements and other initiatives . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa-branded payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits. If they continue, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses. We also face competitive pressures on pricing. We and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of Visa-branded payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain large merchants. Some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions, using both traditional and new technology platforms.  Examples include closed-loop payment systems  that are specific to a single merchant  or multi-merchant solutions like the Merchant Customer Exchange, which is designed for a mobile platform and has many merchant participants.  Such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers, including discounts or customized offers.  If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our transaction volume. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives. 19 Certain financial institutions or merchants have exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards, and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues . Certain financial institutions or merchants have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. In addition, these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business and revenues. Failure to maintain relationships with issuers, acquirers, merchants and account holders, and the failure of our financial institution clients or third parties to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business . We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the network exclusivity rules, we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants, acquirers and processors. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with merchants, who directly receive incentives from us. We also engage with merchants, acquirers and processors and provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. Outside the United States, some governments only permit local providers to complete domestic processing, which prohibits us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of the transactions. Therefore, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving Visa-branded cards. Our inability to oversee the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and to the extent that such third-party vendors or our financial institution clients fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be impaired. Negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation, which are key assets of our business . Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry's quality of service, use and protection of account holder data, regulatory compliance, financial condition, corporate responsibility and other factors. Negative perception or publicity, particularly in light of the rapid, widespread use of social media channels, could cause damage to our brands and reputation. Our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients or other third parties, or by circumstances that are outside of our control: ##TABLE_START  Our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as aggressive creditor practices. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brands in Europe could affect our brands and reputation globally. While Visa Europe has very broad latitude to use our brands and technology within its region, Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance, promoting or maintaining the strength of our brands. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  We may be associated with adverse developments with respect to our industry, and with new rules and regulations concerning human rights conditions, our corporate responsibility regarding those conditions and resulting disclosure requirements. ##TABLE_END 20 ##TABLE_START  Any negative perception of the United States arising from its political, economic, social or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brands globally by associating Visa with those positions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could turn clients and consumers away from our brand and products, require us to take on additional liabilities and costs, result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, and materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business. Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have affected and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and account holders, and may potentially impact our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business . The current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and other oil producing countries, which could affect oil prices, economic fragility in the Eurozone and in the United States, higher interest rates hurting the housing market, sluggish job creation, political discord, spending cuts and debt defaults. While there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies, emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth. Consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels, elevated housing inventory, deflation, changes in savings rates, continued equity market volatility, decreased export activity, lowered government spending and additional government intervention. Furthermore, continued challenges in the credit environment, bank instability, downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt, political issues affecting the handling of national debt, and the uncertainty arising from new government policies could also impact our clients, merchants and account holders. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world. These include defaults on government debt, exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps. Most recently, the economic situations in various countries in Europe have been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of debt defaults. If such defaults occur, or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability, economic turmoil is likely to result, and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant. The volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones. These include the following: ##TABLE_START  Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budgets or increase requests for greater incentives or reduced fees from us. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, which could reduce account holders' desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may increase account holder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing their value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business in those regions with our financial institution clients. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  The U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in the U.S. debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are in U.S. treasury and government securities. ##TABLE_END 21 ##TABLE_START  Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage loan commitments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Declines in stock prices or significant instability in the securities markets worldwide could cause consumer spending to decline materially. ##TABLE_END Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, growth, revenue, profitability and overall business. A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions . ##TABLE_START  We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions, and our clients pay us fees in connection with them. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. Some of these cross-border transaction fees vary depending on whether the transaction currency is different than the account holder's billing currency as provided to Visa by his or her issuer. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result when our clients settle transactions in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as a result of regulation, changes to tax policy, litigation, competitive pressures, reduced volatility in currency markets, or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical, economic, social and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, social or political instability, natural disasters, effects of climate change and outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases. The need for conversion of currencies declines as cross-border travel is impacted. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Moreover, if our financial institution clients decide to change practices (e.g., prohibit certain transactions or increase account holder fees associated with cross-border transactions) there could be a decline in account holder spending because the value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. ##TABLE_END Transactions outside the United States represent an increasingly important part of our strategy, which we hope will continue to grow. However, a decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and multi-currency transactions will decrease the number of cross-border transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. While the amount of our indemnification obligations has no limit, our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial 22 resources. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We estimate settlement exposure under the indemnity based on the sum of three inputs. The first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin. The second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume. The third is the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. We generally guarantee the payment of any validly issued Visa Travelers Cheque that has been negotiated in good faith and properly presented for payment in the event that the Cheque is not honored by its issuing institution. Additionally, from time to time, we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary. See Note 11  Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Some of our clients are considered group members under Visa's operating regulations. As a result, some of these group members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flow. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or comply with new laws and regulations, the use of our products, our revenues and net income could decline . Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry. These include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile, and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties' intellectual property rights. If we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, it could materially and adversely affect the use of our products, our revenues and net income . If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised, the perception of our brands, and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected . Our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunctions, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, effects of climate change or other catastrophic events. In addition, our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computer-based attacks. The latter could include computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. See  Account data breaches involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues . If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.  Finally, potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs, both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and materially reduce our revenues or operating results. 23 Account data breaches involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues . Our clients, merchants, other service providers and we process, store or transmit account holder information in connection with Visa-branded cards and payment products. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. Breach of the systems processing, storing or transmission of sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, reputational damage and claims against us. A breach may subject Visa to governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in fines or enforcement actions against the company. If we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any material data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards, which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, any data security breach could result in additional regulation, which could materially increase our compliance costs. An increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards or payment products . Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder information. They use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving our payment products. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using Visa-branded cards or payment products. A rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products, or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs and materially and adversely affect our payments volume and revenues. Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands . Visa and Visa Europe maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and us could negatively affect account holders from Visa Europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in Visa Europe's region. Failure to authorize, clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands. Structural and Organizational Risks Due to the nature of our relationship and the terms we have agreed to with Visa Europe, we have little ability to control its operations in its region, and as a result, we may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business . Visa Europe's exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the Framework Agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee Visa Europe's operations in its region. If we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to Visa Europe and its members, Visa Europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation costs. This may result in added costs and expenses to our business. Furthermore, the licenses granted under the Framework Agreement may raise licensing, payment and associated tax treatment concerns. Visa Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region. If the acquired business has operations in Visa Europe's region, Visa Europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there. Finally, Visa Europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies, including, but not limited to, our ongoing litigation in the U.K. and our ongoing case with the European Commission, that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally. 24 If Visa Europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock under its put option, we are likely to incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income . We have granted Visa Europe a put option, which Visa Europe can exercise at any time and which would require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from Visa Europe's members within 285 days. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option could likely be in excess of $10 billion dollars and we may need to obtain third-party financing in order to meet our obligation through the issuance of either debt or equity. An equity offering, or the payment of part of the exercise price with our stock, would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. See  Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B common stock, could result in dilution to holders of our existing class A common stock, which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class A common stock .  Sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms. See Note 2  Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. In addition, we are required to assess any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary on our consolidated statements of operations. Consequently, the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share. These quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant. The existence of these changes in the fair value of the put option could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and increase any associated costs. If we acquire Visa Europe, we may also encounter difficulties in integrating Visa Europe's business and systems into our existing operations. If we cannot do so quickly and cost-effectively, the integration could divert the time and resources of senior management and other key resources, disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we would become subject to any ongoing or future regulatory disputes as a result of EU regulations that govern the operations of Visa Europe. We may also be required to assume any ongoing or future litigation involving Visa Europe. If we cannot remain organizationally effective, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment . For us to remain organizationally effective, we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resources, and incorporate both global and local perspectives into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand quickly, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, if we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, execute our strategy, and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes, as needed, we may not be successful in this increasingly dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment. We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees . Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. Acquisitions, strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations . Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. We are also subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in Visa Europe's territory, which will impact our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that they will be successful. 25 With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisitions or through organic development. These include digital, eCommerce and mobile payments. Our recent entry into these businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B common stock, could result in dilution to holders of our existing class A common stock, which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Future offerings of our class A common stock or the end of the transfer restrictions on our class B common stock would increase the number of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class  A common stock. The market price of our class  A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class A common stock outstanding could occur in the future. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted . Under our retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class  B common stock will become convertible into shares of class A common stock, benefiting the holders of class  B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class  A common stock. The amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution. Holders of our class B and C common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions, and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class A common stock . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class A common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control . Provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation, in our current bylaws and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to Visa Members, as defined in our current certificate of incorporation, no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows . Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. The payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If, as a result of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends to all of our stockholders. Specifically, if a dividend is declared or paid, an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock. 26 ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding class A, B and C common stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole 28 discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Certain merchants in the settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the litigation escrow account.The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, an additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded and payments totaling $57 million were made from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $1.4 billion related to covered litigation as of September 30, 2014. See  Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  During fiscal 2012, we recorded: a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities; a covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits; and the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and interest, which increased net income by $326 million. ##TABLE_END 30 ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2014 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. Financial highlights. During fiscal 2014, we recorded net income of $5.4 billion or $8.62 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 9% and 14% over the prior year, respectively. For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 5,721  $ 4,980  $ 4,203  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 9.07  $ 7.59  $ 6.20  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 and 2012 exclude the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END We recorded net operating revenues of $12.7 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of 8% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $5.0 billion, and included $450 million of litigation provision related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. Excluding this provision, adjusted operating expenses remained flat at $4.6 billion over prior year operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in professional fees and personnel expenses, offset by continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support our global growth initiatives. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. 31 The following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014 (in millions, except for percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Net Income Attributable to Visa Inc.

Operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  During fiscal 2014 and 2012, we recorded litigation provisions of $450 million and $4.1 billion , respectively, and related tax benefits, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision.  Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This resulted in a non-recurring increase in net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million. Additionally, our reported financial results benefited from a non-recurring, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. See Note 19Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Interchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received on January 27, 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued 32 litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account and recorded an additional accrual of $450 million associated with the opt-out claims, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2014 . See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion , $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013 . As of September 30, 2014 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the United States gained momentum over the prior year, with sustained double-digit growth in consumer credit, elevated growth in consumer debit, which had been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012, and double-digit growth in commercial products. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 is 15% compared to 14% for the prior year comparable period. Continued double-digit growth in the number of processed transactions accelerated modestly over the prior year, reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 33 The following tables present nominal payments volume.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 35 Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Non-operating Income Non-operating income mainly includes income, gains and losses earned on investments, accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 6,847  $ 6,379  $ 5,720  $  $  %  % International 5,629  5,177  4,478    %  % Visa Europe     (1 )  %   % Total operating revenues $ 12,702  $ 11,778  $ 10,421  $  $ 1,357  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END 36 The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to prior year due to the negative impact of lower foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2014, combined with the absence of pricing modifications that benefited fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2014, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two percentage points in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2013. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2015 , a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2015, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 5,797  $ 5,352  $ 4,872  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 5,167  4,642  3,975    %  % International transaction revenues 3,560  3,389  3,025    %  % Other revenues      %  % Client incentives (2,592 )  (2,321 )  (2,155 )  (271 )  (166 )  %  % Total operating revenues $ 12,702  $ 11,778  $ 10,421  $  $ 1,357  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Service revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily due to 9% and 8% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% and 10% , respectively. Fiscal 2013 also benefited from the full-year impact of pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily reflecting 8% and 10% growth in nominal cross-border payments volume, respectively. The fiscal 2014 growth in international transaction revenues was slower than the growth in nominal cross-border payments volume for the comparable period mainly due to lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to an increase in license fees as well as increases in optional service or product enhancements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2014 and 2013, as well as overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% for the full 2015 fiscal year. ##TABLE_END 37 Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,875  $ 1,932  $ 1,726  $ (57 )  $  (3 )%  % Marketing      %   % Network and processing      %  % Professional fees    (84 )   (20 )%  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative       %   % Litigation provision   4,100   (4,097 )  NM  NM Total operating expenses (2) $ 5,005  $ 4,539  $ 8,282  $  $ (3,743 )  %  (45 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excluding the litigation provisions of $450 million recorded in fiscal 2014 and $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012 associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2014 and 2012 were $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the percentage change of fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 is flat and fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 is an increase of 8%. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal 2013 . These decreases were partially offset by a continued increase in headcount throughout the organization reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2013 is primarily due to increases in headcount and higher severance charges as a result of organizational restructuring that aligns with our strategic priorities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to elevated spend supporting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup campaigns, combined with increased spend in the second half of the year to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout. Marketing in fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting strategies to promote our products in each of those years and spend on specific campaigns, such as the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and preparation for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in fiscal 2013 and the 2012 London Summer Olympics in fiscal 2012 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing in fiscal 2014 and 2013 increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional fees decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal 2013 as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses in support of our business growth and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities. General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision in  fiscal 2014  and 2012  reflects $450 million and $4.1 billion accruals, respectively, related to the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END 38 Non-operating Income Non-operating income in fiscal 2014 of $27 million increased from $18 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2013 from $68 million in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012  of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19Income Taxes and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  a $264 million tax benefit related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million related to prior fiscal years, as a result of the completion of a study in the second quarter of fiscal 2014; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2014: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013, as mentioned above; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2013: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision. ##TABLE_END Adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 . Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate  (in millions, except for percentages) As reported $ 2,207  $  % Reversal of tax reserves (43 )    Litigation provision 4,098  1,505   Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities     Adjusted $ 6,262  $ 2,061  % ##TABLE_END39 We expect our effective tax rate for the full 2015 fiscal year to be in the low 30s. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:  ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 7,205  $ 3,022  $ 5,009 Investing activities (941 )  (1,164 )  (2,414 ) Financing activities (6,478 )  (1,746 )  (2,655 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1 )    (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (215 )  $  $ (53 ) ##TABLE_ENDOperating activities. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including: ##TABLE_START  the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid. ##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.5 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in both years. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by a decrease in proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. We also used cash on hand to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest ownership. Cash used in investing activities was 40 lower during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above under operating activities as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2012, respectively. Absent all of the above impacts, which are related to the interchange litigation, cash used in financing activities was $5.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $940 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2014 and increase in fiscal 2013 are primarily due to changes in cash used to repurchase shares of our class A common stock in the open market. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan , Note 14Stockholders' Equity and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $5.5 billion at September 30, 2014 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $5.0 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.0 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1ARisk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2014 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit facility. On January 29, 2014 , we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 28, 2015 , replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 29, 2014 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2014 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. 41 Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2014 , was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2014 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2014 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $261 million. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013 , we made $4.4 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants was received in January 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. Receipt of the takedown payments increases our current taxable income by approximately $1.1 billion, and income tax payable by about $368 million, which was fully paid by the end of fiscal 2014. At September 30, 2014 , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion . See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  and  Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion , $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. 42 The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013 . As of September 30, 2014 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2014 , we paid $1.0 billion in dividends. In October 2014 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.48 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $297 million in connection with this dividend on December 2, 2014 . See Note 14Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the \"P/E ratio\" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the \"adjusted sustainable income\" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2014 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2014 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2014 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2014 , the spot P/E ratio was 20.6 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 2.0 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. 43 ##TABLE_START  Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $500 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $100 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $500 million     (in millions)  (in millions)    $12,500  $2,500    $10,000  $2,000    $7,500  $1,500  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. ##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $14 million , $4 million , and $88 million , respectively. The lower contributions in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , as compared to fiscal 2012, were driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets and an increase in the discount rate. In fiscal 2015 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $10 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2014 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. During fiscal 2014 , we acquired a business in which we previously held a minority interest using $134 million of cash on hand. This amount primarily reflects the purchase price of $170 million less cash received. The acquisition extends our processing capabilities internationally. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2014 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $7.3 billion of assets and $151 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million , and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if 44 certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2014. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $  $  $  $   $ 1,038 Leases (2)     Client incentives (3) 3,444  4,613  2,875  1,487  12,419 Marketing and sponsorship (4)     Dividends (5)        Total (6,7,8) $ 4,732  $ 5,000  $ 3,098  $ 1,735  $ 14,565 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes expected dividend amount of $297 million as dividends were declared in October 2014 and will be paid on December 2, 2014 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 14, 2014 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $855 million . At September 30, 2014, we had also accrued $39 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would ##TABLE_END 45 likely be in excess of $10 billion. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2014 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START (8)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2014 , client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value  Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is 46 exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2014 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. 47 Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2014 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. In fiscal 2014, we recorded litigation accruals totaling $1.5 billion for covered litigation, reflecting $1.1 billion of take-down payments received and an additional provision of $450 million. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. 48 Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.3 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2014 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $90 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2014 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2014 and 2013 were $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $32 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2014 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe, which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2014 . We are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis, and record adjustments as necessary. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an 49 increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion , and projected benefit obligations were $983 million and $897 million , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2015 , if any, which would be made in September 2015. 50 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ##TABLE_START    Page As of September 30, 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_END51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Visa Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2014 . We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP Santa Clara, California November 20, 2014  52 VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2014 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\") and Inovant LLC (\"Inovant\") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the retrospective responsibility plan (the \"October 2007 reorganization\" or \"reorganization\"). See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Beginning in fiscal 2013, current income tax receivable is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Previously, it had been included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line. The Company also combined the interest income (expense), investment income and other lines on the consolidated statements of operations into one line entitled, \"Non-operating income.\" All prior period information has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters for a discussion of the covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on 63 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities include auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. 64 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.

The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, and the Visa Europe put option. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with the Company's operating regulations. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17Commitments and Contingencies . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network and CyberSource platform. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and tradenames obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2014 . See Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradename, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2014 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2014 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2014 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2014 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters . 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see  Note 2Visa Europe ), fees from account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a \"bond duration matching\" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 8 years for plans in the United States. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2014, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with Visa's operating regulations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company  indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region, as described in Note 2Visa Europe . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2013-01, which clarifies the scope of ASU 2011-11. As amended, ASU 2011-11 requires disclosure of the effect or potential effect of offsetting arrangements on a Company's financial position as well as enhanced disclosure of the rights of offset associated with a Company's recognized derivative instruments, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The amended standard impacts presentation only. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2013. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, which established the effective date for the requirement to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income. The standard impacts presentation only and does not impact the underlying components of other comprehensive income or net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2013. Beginning with fiscal 2014, the components related to pension and postretirement benefit plans are presented on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. All prior period information has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the full effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 Note 2Visa Europe  As part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa common stock , a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the put option. The put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company's estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put option agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's-length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. The estimated fair value of the put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The valuation of the put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. The Company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . In determining the fair value of the put option on these dates, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 1.9 x. Changes in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2014 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. Visa call option agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATM's in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these events occurring is remote. The Framework Agreement. The relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed-upon circumstances. The base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately $143 million per year for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . This fee is eligible for adjustment annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the annual fee below $143 million . The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. In addition to the licenses, Visa provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed-upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa's systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. Under the Framework Agreement, the Company indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region; and Visa Europe likewise indemnifies the Company for such claims brought within Visa Europes region. However, Visa Europe has expressed an initial view that it is not obligated to indemnify the Company for any claim relating to the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. The Company continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify the Company for all such claims. See Note 20Legal Matters . The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be insignificant at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan  The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation.\" These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of a litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement, and an omnibus agreement, as amended. Covered litigation consists of: ##TABLE_START  the Discover Litigation . Discover Financial Services Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., Case No. 04-CV-07844 (S.D.N.Y) (settled); ##TABLE_END 71 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 ##TABLE_START  the American Express Litigation . American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al., No. 04-CV-0897 (S.D.N.Y.), which the Company refers to as the American Express litigation (settled); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the Attridge Litigation . Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al., Case No. CGC-04-436920 (Cal. Super.); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company's IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction and Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc. et al., Case No. CO4-4276 JSW (N.D. Cal.); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction. ##TABLE_END Litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the litigation escrow account: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $  $ 4,432 Return of takedown payments from settlement fund into the litigation escrow account 1,056   Deposits into the litigation escrow account   Payments to opt-out merchants (1) (57 )   Payments to class plaintiff settlement fund (1)   (4,033 ) Payments to individual plaintiff settlement fund (1)   (350 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,498  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The settlement with the class plaintiffs in these proceedings is subject to the adjudication of appeals. See Note 20Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END An accrual for the covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company recorded an additional $450 million accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2014. See Note 20Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class Settlement Agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the Settlement Agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. 73 VISA INC.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The increase in the Company's Level 1 assets primarily reflects the receipt of takedown payments related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, which were deposited into the Company's litigation escrow account. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters . Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Commercial paper and foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2014 . Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There 74 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2014 . Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company has granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which is carried at fair value in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the put option was $145 million at September 30, 2014 and 2013 . Changes in fair value are recorded as non-cash, non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2Visa Europe . The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the put option. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The Company recognized a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss related to these investments during fiscal 2013 . There were no significant impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2014 and 2012 . At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , these investments totaled $35 million and $30 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . Due to a change in the Company's relationship with one of its investees during fiscal 2013, the Company reclassified equity securities previously accounted for as an equity method investment, with a carrying value of $12 million , to long-term available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of this investment at September 30, 2014 and 2013 was $53 million and $99 million , respectively. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, tradenames, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2014 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2014 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2014 , but require disclosure of their fair values: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2014 , approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 75 VISA INC.

Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2014 . Credit facility. On January 29, 2014 , the Company entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit Facility, which expires on January 28, 2015 , replaced the Company's previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 29, 2014 . The Credit Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. This facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. The participating lenders in the Credit Facility include certain holders of the Company's class B and class C common stock, certain of the Company's clients, and their affiliates. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Visa also agreed to pay a commitment fee, which will fluctuate based on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.00% to 0.75% depending on the type of the loan, and the commitment fee is 0.07% . There were no borrowings under either facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended and as of September 30, 2014 . Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations, which are not presented below as they are not material. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under the current defined benefit pension plan are earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Postretirement benefits plan. The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 80 VISA INC.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million . Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to 83 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2014 , pension plan asset allocations for the above categories were 69% , 29% and 2% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges.

Cash equivalents (money market funds) and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. The fair values of government-sponsored and corporate debt securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2014 or 2013 . A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were immaterial. 84 VISA INC.

The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with Visa's operating regulations. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure increased to approximately $56.9 billion at September 30, 2014 , compared to $53.8 billion at September 30, 2013 , as a result of continued growth in the Company's business. Of these amounts, $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. 85 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2014  September 30, 2013  (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $ Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,242  1,191 Guarantees 1,554  1,411 Total $ 3,905  $ 3,724 ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company maintains a rolling cash flow hedge program with the objective of reducing exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues derived from and payments made in non-functional currencies during the following twelve months. The aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of September 30, 2014 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $39 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $6 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $27 million , $14 million and $16 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted 86 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $41 million pre-tax, to earnings during fiscal 2015. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2014 , the Company has received collateral of $29 million from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2014 . Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2014  September 30, 2013  (in millions) United States $ 1,798  $ 1,621 International  Total $ 1,892  $ 1,732 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 54% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , and 55% in fiscal 2012 . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Note 14Stockholders' Equity  The number of shares of each class and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2014 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except conversion rate) Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1) Class A common stock    Class B common stock  0.4121  Class C common stock  1.0000  Total     ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. As-converted class A common stock is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END 87 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion , $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, the Company deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The following table presents share repurchases in the open market during the following fiscal years: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data)  Shares repurchased in the open market (1)  Average repurchase price per share (2) $ 208.50  $ 161.94 Total cost $ 4,118  $ 5,365 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in table may not recalculate due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END  The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Company's board of directors in October 2013 . As of September 30, 2014 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014 , the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014 . There were no deposits into the litigation escrow account in fiscal 2013 . ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014 (in millions, except per share and conversion rate data) September 2014 Deposits under the retrospective responsibility plan $ Effective price per share (1) $ 215.33 Reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock Conversion rate of class B common stock to class A common stock after deposits 0.4121 As-converted class B common stock after deposits ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Effective price per share calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company's class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company's current certificate of incorporation. ##TABLE_END Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the 88 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2014 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and 129 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013 . Voting rights. Holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Holders of classes B and C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any consolidation, merger, combination or any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the holders of classes B and C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of classes B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $1.0 billion in dividends in fiscal 2014 at a quarterly rate of $0.40 per share. In October 2014 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 2, 2014 , to all holders of record of the Companys classes A, B and C common stock as of November 14, 2014 .

The weighted-average numbers of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were 103 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013 , and 108 million  for fiscal 2012 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 2 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2014  and 2013 , and 3 million for fiscal 2012 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes less than 1 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. ##TABLE_END Note 16Share-based Compensation  The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 59 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost of $172 million , $179 million and $147 million , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. 90 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 During fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START     Expected term (in years) (1)  4.80  6.08  6.02 Risk-free rate of return (2)  1.3 %  0.8 %  1.2 % Expected volatility (3)  25.2 %  29.3 %  34.9 % Expected dividend yield (4)  0.8 %  0.9 %  0.9 % Fair value per option granted  $ 44.11  $ 39.03  $ 29.65 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Beginning in fiscal 2014, assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2014 was approximately 58% and 42% , respectively. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, assumption was fully based on peer companies' data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility.

The relative weighting between Visa historical volatility and the historical volatility of the peer companies was based on the percentage of years Visa stock price information is available since its initial public offering compared to the expected term. The expected volatilities ranged from 22% to 26% in fiscal 2014 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the Companys option activity for fiscal 2014 : ##TABLE_START  Options  Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at October 1, 2013 3,917,206  $ 72.21     Granted 435,025  $ 201.37     Forfeited (116,261 )  $ 150.56     Exercised (1,323,544 )  $ 68.45     Outstanding at September 30, 2014 2,912,426  $ 90.08  5.4  $359 Options exercisable at September 30, 2014 2,181,759  $ 63.03  4.3  $328 Options exercisable and expected to vest at September 30, 2014 (2) 2,832,053  $ 87.79  5.3  $356 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2014 of $213.37 , less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Applies a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30, 2014 to estimate the number expected to vest in the future. ##TABLE_END For the options exercised during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the total intrinsic value was $187 million , $176 million and $247 million , respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $65 million , $59 million and $86 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2014 , there was $17 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. 91 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $199.91 , $147.18 and $96.39 , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $197.76 , $146.18 and $96.97 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $126 million , $98 million and $81 million , respectively.

The performance condition is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $225.46 , $164.14 and $97.84 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 vest approximately 3 years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2014 , there was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.6 years. Note 17Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $134 million , $94 million and $89 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. 93 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2014 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 2,924  $ 2,548  $ 2,117  $ 1,662  $ 1,162  $ 1,272  $ 11,685 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 18Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. There were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Note 19Income Taxes  The Companys income before taxes by fiscal year consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START     (in millions) U.S. $ 6,140  $ 5,992  $ 1,030 Non-U.S. 1,584  1,265  1,177 Total income before taxes and non-controlling interest $ 7,724  $ 7,257  $ 2,207 ##TABLE_ENDU.S. income before taxes included $2.3 billion , $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion of the Company's U.S. entities' income from operations outside of the U.S. for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 94 VISA INC.

See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20Legal Matters . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2014 and 2013 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2014 , the Company had $16 million state and $154 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2031 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2014 , the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2 million and $21 million , respectively. The federal carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2029 . The state carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely . The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years. The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% to pretax income, as a result of the following:  ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate $ 2,704  %  $ 2,540  %  $  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  %   %   % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit (278 )  (4 )%  (328 )  (5 )%  (257 )  (12 )% Prior years U.S. domestic production activities deduction (191 )  (2 )%     %     % Reversal of tax reserves related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense    %     %  (299 )  (14 )% Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to California state apportionment rule changes    %     %  (208 )  (9 )% Other, net (78 )  (1 )%    %   % Income tax provision $ 2,286  %  $ 2,277  %  $  % ##TABLE_END96 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  a $264 million tax benefit related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million related to prior fiscal years, as a result of the completion of a study in the second quarter of fiscal 2014; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2014: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013, as mentioned above; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2013: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision. ##TABLE_END Current income taxes receivable were $91 million and $142 million at September 30, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Non-current income taxes receivable of $597 million were included in other assets at September 30, 2014 . See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , income taxes payable of $73 million and $64 million , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $855 million and $453 million , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 8Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to $5.0 billion at September 30, 2014 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $168 million , $158 million and $130 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.27 , $0.24 and $0.19 in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740Income Taxes , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.3 billion and $1 billion , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $1.3 billion and $1 billion are $1.1 billion and $801 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. 97 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1 $ 1,023  $ Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years (54 )  (133 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year  Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations (4 )  (2 ) Ending balance at September 30 $ 1,303  $ 1,023 ##TABLE_ENDIt is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income in its consolidated statements of operations. In fiscal 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized $10 million and $9 million of interest expense, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2012 , the Company reversed $45 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2014 , the Company accrued $2 million of penalties related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2013 and 2012 , the Company reversed $4 million and $1 million of penalties, respectively. At September 30, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had accrued interest of $39 million and $29 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $5 million and $3 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.  The Company's fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") examination. The Company has filed federal refund claims, mostly related to foreign tax credits, for fiscal years 2002 through 2008, which are also currently under IRS examination. Except for such refund claims, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2009. The Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 California tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\") completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of the examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments on the Company's fiscal 2010 through 2013 Canadian tax returns. The Company has filed notices of objection against these assessments and believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 20Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $  $ 4,386 Reestablishment of obligation related to interchange multidistrict litigation 1,056   Additional provision for legal matters  Payments on legal matters (58 )  (4,384 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,456  $ ##TABLE_ENDCovered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . An accrual for the covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the activity related to covered litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $   $ 4,383 Reestablishment of obligation related to interchange multidistrict litigation 1,056   Additional provision for interchange opt-out litigation   Payments on covered litigation (57 )  (4,383 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,449  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012, which increased its accrued balance for the covered litigation from $285 million to $4.4 billion . During fiscal 2013, pursuant to settlement agreements with the class and individual plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation, the Company paid approximately $4.0 billion and $350 million , respectively, from the litigation escrow account into settlement funds. Under the class settlement agreement, if class members opt-out (the opt-out merchants) of the damages portion of the class settlement, the defendants are entitled to receive payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out (the \"takedown payments\"). On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion were received on January 27, 2014, and deposited into the Companys litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, an additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded and payments totaling $57 million were made from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $1.4 billion related to covered litigation as of September 30, 2014. See further discussion below under Interchange Opt-out Litigation and Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . The Attridge Litigation  On December 8, 2004, a complaint was filed in California state court on behalf of an alleged class of consumers asserting claims against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and MasterCard. Visa Inc. was later added as a defendant. The remaining claims in this action, Attridge v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., et al. , allege that Visa's bylaw 2.10(e) 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 and MasterCard's Competitive Programs Policy, which prohibited their respective members from issuing American Express or Discover cards, constitute unlawful restraints of trade under California's Unfair Competition Law, and seek restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. In the separate \"Indirect Purchaser\" Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases , also pending in California state court (see below), an appeals court reversed the trial courts approval of a settlement agreement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. The trial court subsequently granted final approval of a revised written settlement agreement. Objectors filed notices of appeal in the Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases and the Attridge case. An appeals court affirmed the judgment approving the revised written settlement agreement. Certain objectors filed petitions for rehearing. The Attridge case has been stayed pending final resolution of those appeals. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their \"no surcharge\" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which, together with the complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. The Company and the individual merchants whose claims were consolidated with the MDL (the \"Individual Plaintiffs\") signed a settlement agreement to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the litigation escrow account on October 29, 2012, and the court has dismissed those claims with prejudice. In addition, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include, among other terms: ##TABLE_START  A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have been paid to issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time. The eight month period for the reduction would begin within 60 days after completion of the court-ordered period during which individual class members may opt out of this settlement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances, subject to a cap and a level playing field with other general purpose card competitors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Agreement that the Company will meet with merchant buying groups that seek to negotiate interchange rates collectively. ##TABLE_END 100 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. On January 27, 2014, Visa's portion of the takedown payments related to the opt-out merchants (referenced above), which was calculated to be approximately $1.1 billion , was deposited into the litigation escrow account. Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 16, 2013, a putative class action was filed in federal district court in California against certain financial institutions alleging that they conspired to fix interchange fees and imposed other alleged restraints on competition. The complaint was filed on behalf of an alleged class of all Visa and MasterCard payment cardholders in the United States since January 1, 2000. Although no Visa entity is named as a defendant, the complaint identifies Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, and certain non-defendant financial institutions as co-conspirators, and plaintiffs assert that they may seek leave to amend the complaint to add the co-conspirators as defendants. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and treble damages allegedly to compensate the purported class for more than $54.0 billion dollars in purported overcharges imposed on them each year by defendants and their alleged co-conspirators. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss. The case has been transferred to MDL 1720. Interchange Opt-out Litigation Beginning in May 2013, more than 35 opt-out cases have been filed by hundreds of merchants in various federal district courts, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments, and one of the cases seeks an injunction against the fixed acquirer network fee. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries have filed an opt-out complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants. Visa has acknowledged and confirmed its obligations to indemnify Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. with respect to the claim against them in Wal-Marts complaint. Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the Settlement Agreement. In addition, Visa filed three more similar complaints in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; against The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A.; and against Sears Holdings Corporation. All four complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs may seek damages under the Settlement Agreement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its \"honor all cards\" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. Visa and the other defendants in the opt-out cases in MDL 1720 filed a motion to dismiss the then-pending opt-out complaints in MDL 1720. Wal-Mart and the named class representatives that are defendants in the declaratory judgment cases in MDL 1720 filed motions to dismiss the declaratory judgment complaints, and Visa filed a motion to dismiss Wal-Mart's complaint. All of these motions to dismiss were denied. All the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or 101 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 otherwise included in MDL 1720 are covered litigation for purposes of the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3Retrospective Responsibility Plan . Visa has reached settlement agreements with a number of merchants representing approximately 10% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out. The amount of the settlements is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. A similar case has been filed by merchants in Texas state court, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On September 19, 2014, the plaintiffs in that case filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding standing. While the Company believes that it has substantial defenses in these matters, the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of individual opt-out claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Other Litigation \"Indirect Purchaser\" Actions From 2000 to 2004, complaints were filed on behalf of consumers in nineteen different states and the District of Columbia against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard (and, in California, Visa International). The complaints allege, among other things, that Visa U.S.A.'s \"honor all cards\" rule and a similar MasterCard rule violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws, and common law. The claims in these class actions asserted that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs seek money damages and injunctive relief. Visa has been successful in the majority of these cases, and has resolved the cases in all jurisdictions but California. In California, in the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases, the court dismissed claims brought under the Cartwright Act, but denied a similar motion with respect to Unfair Competition Law claims for unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices. The parties agreed to settlement terms to resolve the dispute, which was granted final approval. The plaintiff in Attridge filed a notice of appeal from the final approval order, as did other objectors to the settlement. An appeals court reversed the judgment approving the settlement agreement, and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in light of the inclusion of the Attridge claims in the release. The parties subsequently agreed upon a revised written settlement agreement, which was granted final approval. An appeals court affirmed the judgment approving the revised written settlement agreement, and certain objectors filed petitions for rehearing. European Competition Proceedings European Commission. On April 3, 2009, the European Commission (\"EC\") issued a Statement of Objections (\"SO\") to Visa Europe, Visa International and Visa Inc. alleging a breach of European competition law, namely Article 81 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the European Economic Area Agreement (the \"EEA Agreement\"). The SO was directed to Visa Inc. and Visa International with respect to the \"honor all cards\" rule, the \"no-surcharge\" rule, and certain consumer card interchange fee practices. In 2010, Visa Europe announced an agreement with the EC to end the proceedings with respect to Visa Europe's debit interchange fees. The EC concluded that the proposed agreement with Visa Europe addressed its competition concerns, made the agreement legally binding upon Visa Europe, and closed its investigation with regard to interchange fees for consumer debit card transactions. On July 31, 2012, the EC announced a supplementary Statement of Objections (\"SSO\") that was sent to Visa Europe concerning interchange for consumer credit card transactions; and, on March 8, 2013, a redacted version of the SSO was served on Visa Inc. and Visa International. The SSO alleges a breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Among other things, the SSO asserts claims jointly against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International, objecting to domestic, cross-border, and inter-regional interchange, Visa Europe's rules relating to cross-border acquiring, and Visa Europes point of sale rules. 102 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 The SSO also announces the EC's intention to impose fines. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. On February 26, 2014, the EC adopted a formal decision accepting Visa Europes commitments addressing domestic interchange, cross-border interchange for credit card transactions within Europe, and cross-border acquiring within Europe, and made the commitments legally binding on Visa Europe. The EC continues the proceedings in respect of inter-regional interchange fees that apply to transactions involving a Visa credit cardholder from outside the Visa Europe territory and a merchant in the European Economic Area (EEA). These interchange fees are set by Visa Inc. U.K. Merchant Litigation . Since July 2013, approximately 20 merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe (used in this U.K. Merchant Litigation section to denote Visa Europe Limited and/or relevant subsidiary/affiliate companies), Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct primarily in relation to U.K. domestic and/or Irish domestic and/or intra-EEA interchange fees for credit and debit cards. After a successful application for summary judgment, the claims of most merchants were limited to the 6 year period immediately preceding the issuance of each claim. These merchants intend to apply for permission to appeal. In addition, since March 2013, approximately 20 additional merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have threatened to commence proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International entered into standstill agreements with respect to a majority of those merchants claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. Altogether, therefore, merchants accounting for more than 50% of U.K. retail sales have either filed claims or preserved their right to do so. The amount of interchange being challenged is substantial. Although not all of the merchant claims have been served and thus the full scope of the claims is not yet known, and there are substantial defenses to these claims, the total damages sought in the claims that have been served exceed several billion dollars. Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International in connection with the European Competition Proceedings, in our opinion, including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed Visa Inc. of its position that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for any claim in the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in either the European Commission matter or the filed or unfiled claims in the U.K. Merchant Litigation. Visa Inc. continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify for all such claims. While the parties are not currently in non-binding arbitration, both parties have initiated the executive engagement aspect of the dispute resolution procedure contemplated by the Framework Agreement to resolve their dispute regarding this indemnification issue. Canadian Competition Proceedings Merchant Litigation . Beginning in December 2010, a number of purported civil follow-on cases to the Competition Bureau's proceeding were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and ten financial institutions on behalf of purported classes of merchants and others that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard. In Saskatchewan, a separate action was filed against Visa Canada Corporation and Visa Inc., two MasterCard entities, and a number of smaller Canadian issuing banks that are not named as defendants in any of the existing proceedings. The purported class action lawsuits allege conduct contrary to Section 45 of Canada's Competition Act and also assert claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiffs allege that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCard's respective \"no-surcharge\" and \"honor all cards\" policies had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. On March 26, 2014, the British Columbia Supreme Court, in Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. , granted the plaintiffs' application for class certification in part, allowing plaintiffs to proceed as a class on, among other claims, claims for price fixing under Canada's Competition Act. Both plaintiff and defendants are appealing aspects of the certification decision to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The lawsuits in Quebec, Ontario, 103 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 Alberta, and Saskatchewan are either being held in abeyance or are effectively stayed pending further proceedings in the British Columbia lawsuit. The pending Canada Merchant Litigation lawsuits largely seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief, but some allege substantial damages. Dynamic Currency Conversion On February 4, 2013, following an investigation into Visa's policies relating to the provision of Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (\"ACCC\") commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., VWPL, and Visa AP (Australia) Pty Limited alleging that certain Visa policies related to the provision of DCC services contravened Australian competition law. The ACCC later filed an amended claim adding Visa International as a respondent. DCC refers to conversion from one currency to another, either of the price of goods or services by the merchant, or of cash withdrawals by an ATM. Among other things, the ACCC alleges that: (1) from May 2010 to October 2010, Visa prohibited DCC services with respect to transactions on Visa international payment cards conducted at Australian merchant outlets that had not previously been conducting DCC transactions; and (2) from at least May 2007, Visa prohibited DCC services with respect to cash withdrawals at Australian ATMs on Visa international payment cards. The ACCC seeks declaratory relief and a monetary penalty. The potential amount of any penalty cannot be estimated at this time. Data Pass Litigation On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in federal district court in Connecticut. The plaintiff claims, among other things, that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were deceived into also incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the alleged unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (\"data pass\"), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. Visa allegedly aided and abetted the conduct of the other defendants. Plaintiff seeks certification of a class of persons and entities whose credit card or debit card data was improperly accessed by Webloyalty.com since October 1, 2008, and seeks damages, restitution, and injunctive relief. Webloyalty.com, GameStop, and Visa each filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court granted as to the claims that are grounded in fraud. The court reserved decision on whether all of the claims in the amended complaint are grounded in fraud, and granted plaintiff leave to file a further amended complaint. On August 15, 2014, plaintiff filed a second amended class action complaint against the same defendants as in the amended complaint, asserting the same claims. Korean Fair Trade Commission Following a complaint lodged by a Visa client, in July 2011 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (\"KFTC\") initiated an investigation into Visas requirements for the processing of international transactions over VisaNet. The KFTC has the authority to issue an injunction or a fine. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A., and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek damages \"in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling,\" injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint against the same defendants, also asserting that the ATM access fee rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs request treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer 104 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2014 class actions were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court, and were later combined into a single amended complaint which challenges the same ATM access fee rules and names Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. These consumer class actions purport to represent classes and sub-classes of consumers in claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and also allege claims under antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes in certain states and the District of Columbia. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, treble damages, and restitution where available under state law. On February 13, 2013, the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss the complaints in the National ATM Council class action and the consumer class actions, and dismissed the cases without prejudice. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia subsequently denied plaintiffs motions for leave to file amended complaints in the National ATM Council class action and the consumer class actions, and denied plaintiffs motions for an order altering or amending the court's February 13, 2013 judgment. Plaintiffs filed notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \" Division \" ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or \" CID, \" to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter On September 21, 2012, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \" Bureau \" ) requested that Visa provide on a voluntary basis documents and information regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section 920(b)(1)(B) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693o-2, and Regulation II, 12 C.F.R.  235.7(b) (commonly known as the Durbin Amendment and regulations). The request focuses on information related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. The revenue generated by the PIN Debit Gateway Service is not material to the Companys financial statements. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau and responding to its information requests. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau On February 7, 2013, Visa received a letter from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( \" CFPB \" ) seeking documents and information, on a voluntary basis, regarding Visa's practices with respect to the conversion of U.S. cardholder foreign transactions from foreign currency into U.S. dollars. On November 6, 2014, the CFPB notified Visa that it had completed its investigation and did not intend to recommend taking enforcement action against Visa. Target Data Breach On March 3, 2014, a purported class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against Target, Visa and MasterCard alleging, among other things, violations of Utah unfair competition law, invasion of privacy, negligence and breach of contract as a result of unauthorized access in November and December 2013 to certain personal information and payment card data stored by Target. The complaint also alleges that Visa and MasterCard unlawfully failed to implement chip technology in the United States. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. On April 4, 2014, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order conditionally transferring the action to an existing MDL related to the Target data breach where Visa has not been a party in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, In re Target Corp. Customer Data Security Breach Litigation , MDL No. 2522. Visa and MasterCard filed a motion to separate and remand the claims against them, or alternatively, to remand the action in its entirety. The motion was granted, and the claims against Visa and MasterCard were severed and remanded to the District of Utah. The case remains stayed. 105 VISA INC.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2014 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2014 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2014 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2014 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business General Business Developments Visa Inc., which we refer to as Visa or the Company, is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. It also offers fraud protection for account holders and rapid payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution clients. Visa Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2007. In October 2007, we undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association, Visa Canada Corporation and Inovant LLC became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Visa Europe Limited remains owned and governed by its European member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of Visa Inc. Visa Inc. completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in March 2008. General business developments in fiscal 2015 included the following: ##TABLE_START  Product innovation . Visas fundamental approach to innovation focuses on: (i) supporting an evolving payments ecosystem; (ii) enhancing payment system security through innovation; and (iii) developing new platforms, products and services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START i. Evolving payments ecosystem .  By providing new and existing clients and partners greater access to Visas network and payment capabilities, Visa is contributing to the evolving payments ecosystem. Through Visa's new developer center, financial institutions, software, cloud computing and other technology companies and new entrants will be able to more easily access Visa payment capabilities through programing interfaces and software developer kits beginning in 2016. The Visa Ready program also is intended to enable our partners to quickly deploy devices, software and services to consumers that meet Visa's standards, with a goal of significantly accelerating the pace of innovation in payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ii. Enhancing payment system security through innovation .  During 2015, Visa continued to make strides to enhance the security of the broader payments ecosystem with the following programs: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Tokenization : Tokenization replaces account numbers with digital tokens for online and mobile payments. This benefits merchants and our financial institution clients by removing sensitive account information from online and mobile payments and has the potential to reduce fraud risk. Visa has been working with several partners, including Apple, Google and Samsung, who are using our tokenization service to offer mobile payment solutions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. EMV chip payment technology : Visa is addressing fraud at the physical point-of-sale by working with merchants and our financial institution clients in the U.S. to introduce EMV-chip payment technology. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START c. Fraud and data analytics : As an industry leader in payment security, we enhanced our real-time data analytics capabilities. When combined with Visas centralized network structure, these capabilities help our financial institution clients and merchants identify and address fraud. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START iii. New platforms, products and services . Visa continues to develop new platforms, products and services to benefit clients, merchants, consumers and other partners. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. Bangalore Technology Center: We are investing in internal technology resources and have recently opened a new technology development center in Bangalore, India that will play a central role in the Companys efforts to accelerate digital commerce globally. The new technology center, a combination of office and collaboration space for more than 1,000 Visa developers, is Visas largest outside the U.S. ##TABLE_END 5 ##TABLE_START b. Visa Checkout : Visa Checkout is a fast, simple and intuitive payment experience that allows consumers to pay for goods online on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop, in just a few clicks.  This service is presently available for eCommerce merchants and financial institutions in 16 countries around the world including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and the U.S. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START c.

Visa Direct :  Visa Direct provides a fast, secure and convenient solution for Visas ecosystem of clients and partners. It enables customers to send and receive person-to-person payments and funds disbursements, and facilitates business to business settlements directly to eligible Visa account holders quickly and securely. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START e. mVisa: In August 2015, Visa and several banks in India launched a pilot program testing mVisa, a mobile application, in India. The service extends the utility of existing Visa accounts by linking a consumers Visa debit, credit or prepaid accounts to the mVisa mobile application that enables purchases in store, online and person-to-person through his or her mobile device . ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  U.S. Regulation . Rules were implemented in the U.S. during 2011 and 2012 with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), which regulates, among other things, debit interchange reimbursements rates, the availability of debit networks on a debit card and merchant transaction routing choice. The Federal Reserve's interpretation of the debit interchange provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act was upheld in March 2014 by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. After the Supreme Court declined to review the ruling, the Federal Reserve on August 10, 2015 confirmed its position on the sole remaining issue related to the interchange cost calculation, leaving the debit interchange rules in effect as originally adopted. See Government Regulation below. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015 developments in Russia . In response to U.S. and EU sanctions targeting Russia's financial sector, the Russian government modified its National Payments Systems laws to require that all payment transactions in the Russian Federation be processed within the country. We agreed in February 2015 to transfer processing of Russian domestic transactions to the government-owned processor. Additionally, a new Russian law requiring all personal data of its citizens to be stored in Russia went into effect on September 1, 2015. Authorities have also indicated that Russia will issue a new national payment card called the \"MIR\" card. See Government Regulation  Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions  below. ##TABLE_END On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. Closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See Note 2Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Nature of Operations Visa's mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce. We operate an open-loop payments network, VisaNet, through which Visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between: (i) issuers  financial institutions that issue Visa-branded cards or payment products to account holders, and (ii) acquirers  financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. The issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. The acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. A typical Visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her Visa-branded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction information is then transmitted 6 electronically to the acquirer and routed through VisaNet to the issuer for authorization. Following authorization, a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer. The following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on VisaNet. Our operating revenues are principally comprised of service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues, and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. ##TABLE_START  Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Service revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily generated from the number of transactions we process. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. ##TABLE_END U.S. dollar settlements with our financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. 7 In order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network, we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The settlement indemnification applies to the amount of Visa payment transactions that have occurred, but have not yet settled. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. We have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years . Core Products and Services Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: (i) pay now with debit; (ii) pay ahead with prepaid; or (iii) pay later with credit products. Visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital, eCommerce, person-to-person payments and mobile products and services. These services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. ##TABLE_START  Debit . Our debit payment solutions support issuers' payment products that draw on demand deposit accounts, such as checking accounts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Prepaid. Our prepaid payment solutions support issuers' payment products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing account holders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Credit. Our credit payment solutions support issuers' deferred payment and customized financing products. ##TABLE_END Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide value-added services, including information products, such as risk scoring and loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our network. Visa's processing services continue to expand to address the needs of participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa Debit Processing Services (\"DPS\"). Merchant gateway services provided through our CyberSource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for eCommerce merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online. DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. These and other services support our issuers and acquirers and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network. Processing Infrastructure VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers, including two data centers in the U.S. that are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement among Visa Inc., Visa Europe Limited and others, Visa Europe's processing centers in the United Kingdom must maintain interoperability with Visa's synchronized system. Intelligent access points around the world complete the VisaNet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institution clients worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services. Visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the U.S. and internationally that enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders, our financial institution clients and our processing partners. Intellectual Property Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our family of Visa marks, our PLUS mark and our Dove design mark, are important to our business. Through agreements with our issuers, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. 8 Seasonality We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. Working Capital Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Concentration of Business and Financial Information About Geographic Areas For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business included elsewhere in this report. Competition We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment. These include: ##TABLE_START  paper-based payments, principally cash and checks; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid and private-label products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  eCommerce, mobile wallets and mobile payments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house (\"ACH\") and electronic data interchange. ##TABLE_END Based on payments volume, total volume and number of transactions, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major competitors for calendar year 2014: ##TABLE_START Company (1)  Payments Volume  Total Volume  Total Transactions  Cards   (billions)  (billions)  (billions)  (millions) Visa Inc. (2)  $ 4,761  $ 7,360  98.4  2,402 MasterCard (3)  $ 3,281  $ 4,499  60.1  1,437 American Express (3)  $ 1,011  $ 1,023  6.7  JCB (3)  $  $  2.4  Discover/Diners Club (3)  $  $  2.4  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table because Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. Visa Europe data are not included. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB, and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1060 (March 2015). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.  Certain general purpose payments network competitors are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the U.S. Our competitors also have leading positions in certain countries. For example, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. ##TABLE_END In the global debit network market segment, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands, including STAR, NYCE and PULSE in the U.S., EFTPOS in Australia, NETS in Singapore and Interac in Canada. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands provide the primary network, and our brands are used 9 primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume. The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. We may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space, many of which are non-financial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model. The emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on eCommerce and/or mobile technologies. PayPal and Alipay are examples. These providers compete with us directly in some cases, yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours.  We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience, interoperability, accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate. We do so by partnering with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. Employees At September 30, 2015, we employed approximately 11,300 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Government Regulation  Interchange reimbursement fees . We have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the U.S. and many other geographies. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve implemented new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, setting a cap on the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions. These rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  The Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act may continue to harm our overall business included elsewhere in this report. Certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. also regulate or have the power to regulate debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates and the governing authorities in India regulate the merchant discount rate . In May 2015, the EU published a regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions, and interchange caps for intra-regional debit and credit card transactions will take effect on December 9, 2015. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Network exclusivity and routing . The Dodd-Frank Act limits the issuers' and our ability to impose rules for, or choose various forms of, network exclusivity and preferred routing in the U.S. debit and prepaid network market segments. Other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations. U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues, including those pertaining to us to some extent. The CFPBs future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers, acquirers, consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures, payment card practices, fees, routing and other matters with respect to credit, debit and prepaid cards. No-surcharge rules . We have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their Visa-branded card or payment product instead of other means. As part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation, however, Visa has agreed to modify our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances. See  Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. A number of U.S. states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. have taken steps to prohibit surcharging. Following court challenges, some of these laws have been invalidated by federal courts in certain states and upheld in others. 10 Data protection and information security . Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions globally . In accordance with governing law, we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstances, to provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach. In addition, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council periodically reviews aspects of our operations in the U.S. to examine our compliance with data integrity, security and operational requirements and standards, as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. Regulators around the globe are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection due to the evolving nature and handling of data. The interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws around the globe are often uncertain and in a state of flux. Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctioned countries . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We have policies, procedures, systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions. Government-imposed market participation influences and restrictions . Our market reach remains limited by certain governments' influence on their domestic payments competition and/or their protection of domestic issuers or payments network processors. Regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries. Regulation of Internet, mobile payment and other types of transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants, including our financial institution clients and us, to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions. For example, U.S. federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify Internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such transaction requests. State governments have been interested in the potential blocking of Internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol, or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such Internet purchases. Implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us, and may reduce merchant acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products for these purchases. The U.S. Congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us. Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including mobile payment transactions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly. These new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients' ability to offer existing products and services, extend credit via payment cards and products, and offer new types of payment programs, which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business . We generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers. They are, however, a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and overall payments volume. We have historically set default interchange reimbursement rates in the U.S. and many other geographies. Interchange reimbursement rates, our operating rules and related practices have become subject to continued or increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates and practices. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. It may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. In addition, as a result of such regulations, we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers. In certain instances, some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants, regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept Visa-branded cards or payment products or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems or forms of payment. In addition, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs. For these reasons, additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may make Visa-branded cards and payment products less desirable, reduce our overall transaction volumes, and harm our overall business. We are subject to regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network, or that deny them the option of selecting only our network . In order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into VisaNet, we promote certain practices to ensure that Visa-branded cards are processed over our network. We have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the Visa network or receive incentives if they do so. In addition, certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network. We refer to these various practices as network exclusivity. In addition, certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks co-reside on Visa debit cards. For example, the Visa Rules require that all authorization, clearance and settlement of international transactions must be done through VisaNet. These are commonly referred to as routing rules. The Dodd-Frank Act already limits our and issuers' ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area. Additional legislation or regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process. In order to retain transaction volume, we may reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers, acquirers or merchants. Any of these outcomes could harm our overall business. The Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act may continue to harm our overall business . As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, with a possible fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction in the average system-wide fees previously charged. The Federal Reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules 12 also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. These regulations have adversely affected our U.S. debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing, reduced the volume and number of U.S. debit payments we process, and diminished associated revenues. Although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the October 2011 regulations, our business could continue to be affected, including if the Federal Reserve issues new or revised regulations. Negative pressures have arisen through various channels. Other debit networks may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reductions to win routing preference, which in turn puts more pressure on the business terms offered by Visa. A number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some clients elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks or reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs, while others imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other debit networks based on lower cost or other factors. Other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future. Some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules. Our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors. Overall, the regulations and developments arising from the Dodd-Frank Act could harm our overall business. New laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings . Regulators around the world increasingly note each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. The Dodd-Frank Act and the European Union interchange regulation are developments with such potential. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report . Similarly, new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments. The risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings. We may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point of sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, and data use or protection. As a result, the Visa Rules may differ from country to country or by product offering. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions. In addition, adverse developments, regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation and result in greater regulatory and legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Any of these factors could harm our overall business. Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries . Governments in some countries provide resources to or protection for their domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country. In China, for example, UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa, would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, legislation and implementation guidelines for BCCIs have yet to be published and finalized. Meanwhile in Russia, National Payment Legislation has effectively prevented Visa from processing in the domestic market and has mandated that Visa migrate its domestic processing business to the state owned NSPK, which is the only entity allowed to process domestically. National laws that mandate domestic processing may increase our costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded cards issued or processed in those regions. These actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there and in 13 other countries that may adopt similar practices. These actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets. Although we are trying to effect change in these countries, we may not succeed. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands. We are subject to regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security . Privacy, data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions that have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices. These laws and regulations can impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services, and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. Our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands. These laws and regulations may increase Visa  s and our clients' costs, decrease the number of Visa-branded cards our clients issue and decrease our payments volume and revenue. Evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us . Regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly. Examples include: ##TABLE_START  Data protection and information security . Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the U.S. and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients around the globe are subject to similar requirements under privacy laws and bank regulatory regimes. For example, as of September 1, 2015, Russia amended its personal data law to require personal data operators to store personal information of Russian citizens in databases located in Russia. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulatory and sanctions compliance . We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. An increase in the number of OFAC sanctions may affect the issuance, acceptance, reputation, and revenues associated with Visa-branded cards. Some of our clients located outside of the U.S. may not be subject to these same laws, regulations and sanctions, and, as a result, may initiate transactions that are permissible in their countries but that may not be permissible were the transaction to take place in the U.S. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulation of the price of credit . Many jurisdictions in which Visa-branded cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. In the U.S., these include regulations issued under the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, as amended by the Credit CARD Act of 2009.  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Increased U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau scrutiny. Regulatory changes by the CFPB that impose new requirements on or restrict the terms under which financial products can be offered could increase our clients  costs and decrease the number of Visa-branded payment cards our clients issue. The CFPB also has supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority over certain financial institutions , their service providers  and other entities , which could include us due to our processing of credit, debit and prepaid transactions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Increased central bank oversight. Several central banks and similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry, and in some cases have already designated certain payment systems as \"systemically important payment systems\" or \"critical infrastructure.\" For example, Visa Europe was recently designated as systematically important by the Bank of England. Any such oversight may lead to additional regulations by central banks and other government regulators. These could include new settlement procedures, cyber security requirements or other policies or operational rules to address settlement and operational risks. Increased central bank oversight could also include new criteria for financial institution client participation and merchant or other non-bank access to our payments system. For example, in China, draft cyber security legislation may prevent companies like Visa from bringing international best practice standards for fraud and risk management when the market is open. ##TABLE_END 14 ##TABLE_START  Safety and soundness regulation . Banking regulations enacted in the U.S. and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less likely to become an issuer of Visa-branded cards because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Regulation of Internet and mobile transactions . Legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using Visa-branded cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the laws that govern the transactions, their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property rights. In addition, new mobile regulatory requirements could impact our business practices, for instance in China where new regulation may prevent companies like Visa from introducing new technologies when the market opens to them. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Money transfer regulations. As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. federal and state money transfer regulations, international payments laws and other existing, new or evolving regulations which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance costs. ##TABLE_END Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Our programs and policies are designed to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-corruption and sanctions regulations and other laws, and we continue to enhance them. But, as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal money penalties, litigation and damage to our global brand reputation. The impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which Visa-branded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept Visa-branded cards, thereby harming our overall business. Litigation Risks Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments . Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation, which is described in Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. The U.S. retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the U.S. covered litigation. These include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our IPO and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class A common stock (or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings). They also include a loss sharing agreement, a judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended. In addition, our U.S. financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to Visa U.S.A. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. These mechanisms are unique, complicated and tiered, and if we cannot use one or more of them, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. The principal remaining U.S. covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report . Beginning in 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed on behalf of merchants against us, MasterCard and/or other defendants, including certain Visa member financial institutions. We refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation or MDL 1720. Among other allegations, the plaintiffs alleged that Visa's setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in MDL 1720 seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief. The consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars. Because these lawsuits were brought under the U.S. federal antitrust laws, any actual damages would be trebled. The allocation of any monetary judgment or certain settlements among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated February 7, 2011, and amended August 26, 2014 and October 22, 2015. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities to our consolidated financial statements 15 included in Item  8 of this report. Visa's portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement, as amended, would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. We signed settlement agreements in connection with MDL 1720, which included an agreement to pay approximately $4.0 billion to the class plaintiffs. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. A number of merchants have filed opt-out cases in various federal district courts. All of the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that MDL 1720 includes: (i) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings; and (ii) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 or that are brought after October 22, 2015, by an opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . Failure of our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent. The U.S. retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the U.S. covered litigation. The plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future, except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our IPO that are transferred to or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation or that are brought by a Rule 23(b)(3) opt out and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720. In addition, non-monetary settlement terms and judgments in the U.S. covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business. Therefore, even if our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of, and judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation, it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation. As described in Note 2Visa Europe  and  Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report, on November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. The closing is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates are, or may become, a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition terms, the Company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from such existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the U.K. loss sharing agreement. If claims are not covered by these transactional protections, Visa Europe may have recourse under its membership documents against members under the terms of the existing indemnity arrangements (other than in respect of certain claims relating to U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees). However, similar to the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, failure of these protections to insulate us adequately from the impact of settlements or judgments in the existing and potential litigation against Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. If we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits, we may have to pay substantial damages . Like many other large companies, we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition or antitrust law, consumer protection law or intellectual property law, among others. Examples of such claims are described more fully in Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages; therefore, we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability. Accordingly, we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings. Particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers, private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business. If we are unsuccessful in our defense against a large class action lawsuit, such as the U.S. or Canadian merchant class action lawsuits, monetary damages could be 16 significant, which could harm our financial condition. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. There may be limitations on our business or changes to our business practices resulting from our litigation . Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation. We may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation. For example, under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, we have agreed, among other things, to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances. See  Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report. Additional surcharges to credit transactions could adversely impact consumers' usage of Visa-branded payment products. Settlements of, or judgments in pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we set, revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use Visa-branded payment products or make other modifications that could harm our overall business. We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may decrease their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material, adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. We have limited rights to enforce our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which could expose us to significant liabilities . While we have entered into an agreement to acquire Visa Europe, until the transaction closes or if it fails to close, our relationship is governed by the Framework Agreement. In the event Visa Europe fails to meet its obligations under the Framework Agreement, our remedies are limited. We are unable to terminate the Framework Agreement even upon Visa Europe's material, uncured breach. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Under the Framework Agreement, we may be required to indemnify Visa Europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business. This obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions gives rise to such claims. The indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities. In our view, pursuant to the Framework Agreement, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\") in connection with the European Competition Proceedings (i.e., the pending European Commission investigation and the filed or unfiled claims in the U.K. Merchant Litigation), including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed us of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for these claims. If Visa Europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity, we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Business Risks We face intense pressures on client pricing . Pressure on client pricing poses challenges for our business. In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their Visa-branded card base. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments. We have continued to increase the use of incentives such as up-front cash payments and fee discounts in many countries, including the U.S. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to 17 win routing preference in situations where our products co-reside with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options. The economic pressures on our clients arising from the Dodd-Frank Act have also increased our use of incentives. As a result, the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or become unprofitable, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. If we continue to increase incentives to our clients, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume, increasing the amount of fee-based services we provide or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. In addition, we benefit from long-term contracts with certain clients, including those that are large contributors to our revenue. Continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms. We may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations. While we may implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives, we may not be successful in our efforts or they may not offset the decreases in our revenues. We face intense competition in our industry . The global payments industry is intensely competitive and, as a result, our payment programs compete against all forms of payment. These include cash, checks, electronic, eCommerce, virtual currencies and mobile payments, as well as traditional general purpose card networks. In addition, our open-loop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closed-loop payment systems. Traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete. Our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. The Dodd-Frank Act increased this competitive pressure. The risk to maintaining or securing our clients' long-term commitments to our products increased with the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector. We do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In certain circumstances, our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice without significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. See Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Additionally, some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resources. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services than we do, including more innovative ones. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. In many cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions. We expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with, impair or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; ##TABLE_END 18 ##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, eCommerce payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new players and intermediaries in the payments value chain may redirect transactions or steer account holders away from our network; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industry-wide solutions and standards set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, as well as EMVCo, related to EMV-chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. Disintermediation from the payments value chain could harm our business . Our position in the payments value chain is key to our business. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currencies and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries. These competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model. Regulatory actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act or the Federal Reserves Faster Payments efforts  may provide them with increased opportunity to do so. In addition, although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models, they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multi-party payments systems such as ours. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. Additional consolidation in the financial services industry could impact our revenues and harm our overall business . Additional consolidation in the financial services industry or the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors may reduce the overall number of our clients. This could result in the acquired financial institution's Visa business shifting to a competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business to us. Our existing clients may seek to obtain more favorable pricing agreements. We may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses. Pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could impact our revenues and harm our overall business. Merchants' continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance exposes us to additional risks . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa-branded payment cards. Consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry. Some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits. If they continue, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses. Additionally, some merchants have pushed for changes to the Visa Rules which govern Visa acceptance at the point of sale, including the ability to accept only certain types of Visa-branded cards (e.g., credit or debit) and impose account holder surcharges. If successful, where applicable, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of Visa-branded payment products. We also face competitive pressures on pricing. We and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of Visa-branded payment cards. If merchants continue to consolidate, we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain large merchants. Some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions, using both 19 traditional and new technology platforms.  Examples include closed-loop payment systems  that are specific to a single merchant  or multi-merchant solutions like the Merchant Customer Exchange, which is designed for a mobile platform utilizing alternative payment systems and has many merchant participants.  Such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers, including discounts or customized offers.  If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could harm our business. We may not be able to grow or maintain our business due to certain financial institutions or merchants' exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors . Certain financial institutions or merchants have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. In addition, these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business. Our success depends on our relationships with our financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants, account holders and other third parties . We depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services. We do not issue cards, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands. Each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers. Account holders, however, may associate these features with our brands and if they are dissatisfied, our business may be harmed. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's network exclusivity regulations, we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants, acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We already engage in many co-branding efforts, in which we contract with merchants, who directly receive incentives from us. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. Outside the U.S., some governments only permit local providers to complete domestic processing, which prohibits us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of the transactions. Therefore, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or other third party processors in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving Visa-branded cards. Our inability to oversee the end-to-end processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands. In addition, we depend on third parties and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and to the extent that such third-party vendors or our financial institution clients fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be impaired. Negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation . Our brands and reputation are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to Visa-branded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry's quality of service, use and protection of account holder data, regulatory compliance, financial condition, corporate responsibility and other factors. Negative perception or publicity, particularly in light of the rapid, widespread use of social media channels, could cause damage to our brands and reputation. Our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients or other third parties, or by circumstances that are outside of our control: ##TABLE_START  Our clients and other third parties may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands or that are inconsistent with our own business practices. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Until we are able to complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe, our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brands in Europe could affect our brands and reputation globally. While Visa Europe has very broad latitude to use our brands and technology within its region, Visa Europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance, promoting or maintaining the strength of our brands. ##TABLE_END 20 ##TABLE_START  Any negative perception of the U.S. arising from its political, economic, social or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brands globally by associating Visa with those positions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could turn clients and consumers away from our brand and products, require us to take on additional liabilities and costs, result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, and harm our overall business. We may continue to be affected by economic events in financial markets around the world . The current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and other oil producing countries, which could affect oil prices, economic fragility in the Eurozone and in the U.S., higher interest rates hurting the housing market, sluggish job creation, political discord, spending cuts and debt defaults. While there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies, emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth. Consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels, elevated housing inventory, deflation, changes in savings rates, continued equity market volatility, decreased export activity, lowered government spending and additional government intervention. Furthermore, continued challenges in the credit environment, bank instability, downgrades of sovereign, bank and commercial debt, political issues affecting the handling of national debt, and the uncertainty arising from new government policies could also impact our clients, merchants and account holders. The fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world. These include defaults on government debt, exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages, significant increases in oil prices, tax increases, a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps. Most recently, the economic situations in various countries in Europe have been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of debt defaults. If such defaults occur, or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability, economic turmoil is likely to result, and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant. The volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones. These include the following: ##TABLE_START  Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budgets or increase requests for greater incentives or reduced fees from us. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, which could reduce account holders' desire to use these products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may increase account holder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing their value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business in those regions with our financial institution clients. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  The U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in the U.S. debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are in U.S. treasury and government securities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage loan commitments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies. ##TABLE_END 21 ##TABLE_START  The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Declines in stock prices or significant instability in the securities markets worldwide could cause consumer spending to decline materially. ##TABLE_END Any of these developments could harm our overall business. A decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and in multi-currency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability . ##TABLE_START  We generate a significant amount of our revenues from cross-border transactions, and our clients pay us fees in connection with them. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. Some of these cross-border transaction fees vary depending on the transaction currency and whether the transaction currency is different than the account holder's billing currency as provided to Visa by his or her issuer. Additionally, adverse changes in exchange rates could reduce the number of cross-border transactions which may harm our revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In addition, Visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result when our clients settle transactions in different currencies. A reduction in multi-currency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues. Limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multi-currency transactions as a result of regulation, changes to tax policy, litigation, competitive pressures, reduced volatility in currency markets or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical, economic, social and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, social or political instability, natural disasters, effects of climate change and outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases. The need for conversion of currencies declines as cross-border travel is impacted. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Moreover, if our financial institution clients decide to change practices (e.g., prohibit certain transactions or increase account holder fees associated with cross-border transactions), there could be a decline in account holder spending because the value proposition to the consumer could be reduced. ##TABLE_END Transactions outside the U.S. represent an increasingly important part of our strategy, which we hope will continue to grow. However, a decline in non-U.S. and cross-border activity and multi-currency transactions would decrease the number of cross-border transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected as a consequence. We risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. While the amount of our indemnification obligations has no limit, our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources and impact our liquidity. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses, and harm our business. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item  8 of this report. Some of our clients are considered group members under the Visa Rules. As a result, some of these group members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent 22 financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy. To the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy, we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure, which could impact our liquidity. The use of our products and our revenues could decline if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or comply with new laws and regulations . Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry. These include developments in mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance, eCommerce, tokenization, crypto-currency and blockchain technologies. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants, or third parties' intellectual property rights. If we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, it could reduce the use of our products and harm our business. The perception of our brands and our business could be harmed if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised . Processing or other technology malfunctions, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorism, effects of climate change or other catastrophic events may disrupt or compromise our transaction processing systems. In addition, we may be susceptible to physical or computer-based attacks by terrorists or hackers due to our role in the global payments industry. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet and new technologies are used to conduct financial transactions. Threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.  Finally, potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs, both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks. Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar reasons, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and harm our business. We may encounter account data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures involving card or other data processed, stored or transmitted by third parties or by us . We, our clients, merchants, and other service providers process, store or transmit account holder and other information in connection with Visa-branded cards and payment products. In addition, our clients may use third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands. The security measures and procedures we, our clients, merchants and other service providers have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures . Defending against even unsuccessful attempts to access our systems could materially increase our costs. A failure or breach of the systems processing, storing or transmitting sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving Visa-branded cards, reputational damage, claims against us, and loss of clients. If we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach, cyberattacks or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, a breach may also subject Visa to additional regulations or 23 governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions against the Company or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions. Fraudulent or other illegal activity involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could harm our business . Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder and other information. They use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions involving our payment products. Outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing. As a result, more third parties are involved in processing transactions using Visa-branded cards or payment products. A rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands. This could reduce the use and acceptance of Visa-branded cards and payment products, or lead to greater regulation, which could increase our compliance costs, lower our payments volume and harm our overall business. Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems could damage the business and global perception of the Visa brands . Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes and for a period of time afterwards while Visa Europe's systems are being integrated with Visa's systems, Visa and Visa Europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and us could negatively affect account holders from Visa Europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in Visa Europe's region. Failure to authorize, clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands. Structural and Organizational Risks We may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business in certain territories due to our relationship with Visa Europe . Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes, Visa Europe's exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the Framework Agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee Visa Europe's operations in its region. If we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to Visa Europe and its members, Visa Europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation costs. This may result in added costs and expenses to our business. Furthermore, the licenses granted under the Framework Agreement may raise licensing, payment and associated tax treatment concerns. Until our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe closes, Visa Europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region. If the acquired business has operations in Visa Europe's region, Visa Europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there. Finally, Visa Europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies, including, but not limited to, our ongoing litigation in the U.K. and our ongoing case with the European Commission, that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally. We may be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly global, dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment . For us to remain organizationally effective, we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resources, and incorporate both global and local perspectives into our decisions and processes. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to expand quickly, and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, if we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, execute our strategy and implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes, as needed, we may not be successful in this increasingly global, dynamic, competitive, economic and regulatory environment. 24 We may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees . Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. Future sales of our class A common stock, or the end of transfer restrictions on our class B common stock, could result in dilution to holders of our existing class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Future offerings of our class A common stock or the end of the transfer restrictions on our class B common stock would increase the number of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class  A common stock. Likewise, if we complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe and issue the preferred shares, similar impacts on market price and dilution to our existing Class A common stock could occur upon conversion of the preferred shares into Class A common shares. The market price of our class  A common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class A common stock outstanding could occur in the future. If funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the value of our class A common stock will be diluted . Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all U.S. covered litigation will be released back to us. At that time, each share of class  B common stock will become convertible into shares of class A common stock, benefiting the holders of class  B common stock. This in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class  A common stock. The amount of funds released and the market price of our class A common stock will determine the extent of the dilution. Holders of our class B and C common stock may have different interests than our holders of our class A common stock concerning certain significant transactions . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock can vote on certain significant transactions. These include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. The holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class A common stock. Likewise, if we complete the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe and issue the preferred shares, a similar dynamic may occur with the holders of the preferred shares. Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control . Provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation, in our current bylaws and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. For instance, except for limited exceptions, no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance. In addition, except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to Visa Members, as defined in our current certificate of incorporation, no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. We may not be able to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future . Since August 2008, we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class A, B and C common stock. The payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If, as a result of these factors, we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends to all of our stockholders. Specifically, if a dividend is declared or paid, an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock (and on the preferred shares we are obligated to issue if we complete our proposed acquisition of Visa Europe). 25 Acquisitions, strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business . Although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to successfully finance, partner with or integrate them. Such transactions, including our anticipated acquisition of Visa Europe, would present significant challenges and risks. In cases where strategic acquisitions or investments are not successfully implemented or completed, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted. We may incur substantial debt for strategic acquisitions or investments, which could adversely impact our credit ratings . Achieving the benefits of an acquisition is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business and systems into our existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected synergies, any of which we may be unable to achieve on a timely basis or at all. Until our acquisition of Visa Europe is completed, we are subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to Visa Europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in Visa Europe's territory, which impacts our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions. Regulatory constraints, particularly competition regulations, may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges or increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign regulations. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and may disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues. Although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses, products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we cannot guarantee that they will be successful. With the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments, we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past, either through acquisitions or through organic development. These include digital, eCommerce, loyalty services and mobile payments. Our recent entry into these businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Proposed Acquisition of Visa Europe We may not be able to complete the acquisition of Visa Europe on the terms currently contemplated or at all . On November 2, 2015, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Visa Europe Ltd. We and Visa Europe have agreed to use all reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to complete the acquisition. There is no assurance, however, that the acquisition will ultimately be completed, as the obligations of the parties to complete the acquisition are subject to various conditions. These conditions include, among others: ##TABLE_START  receipt of necessary regulatory approvals; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  absence of any material adverse effect (as determined under the definitive transaction documentation) on Visa Europe or the Company since September 30, 2014; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  absence of legal restraints that prohibit the closing of the acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the U.K. loss sharing agreement remaining in full force and effect and the litigation management deed having been fully executed and remaining in full force and effect; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  compliance by each party in all material respects with its obligations under the acquisition agreement; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Visa Europe holding the full power and authority to effect the transaction. ##TABLE_END The acquisition agreement may be terminated by us or Visa Europe, subject to specified exceptions, if the acquisition is not completed by August 2, 2016, or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and non-appealable. 26 If we fail to complete the acquisition, Visa Europe would continue to have the right to require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from Visa Europes members under the terms of the put option (as it existed prior to its amendment in connection with the proposed acquisition). Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. We may not have the resources to fund the purchase price, particularly if the reason we failed to complete the acquisition was due to our inability to raise debt financing. Financing the acquisition of Visa Europe exposes us to risk . To finance the Visa Europe acquisition, we expect to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between $15 and $16 billion in the first half of fiscal 2016, with maturities ranging between two and 30 years depending on market conditions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to issue this debt on favorable terms, in this timeframe, or at all. If we are unable to issue this debt on favorable terms, the cost to us of financing the acquisition may be higher than we currently expect. Moreover, although we currently anticipate that the issuance of this debt will not adversely impact our credit ratings, there can be no assurance that one or more credit rating agencies will not lower our credit ratings, particularly if there is a perceived deterioration in our business or financial prospects. Any lowering of our credit ratings before or in connection with the issuance of this debt would be expected to increase the cost of financing the acquisition. If we are unable to issue this debt and are not able to obtain alternative financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we may be unable to complete the acquisition, which could expose us to liability to Visa Europe and its shareholders. If we issue this debt but then fail to complete the acquisition, we will nevertheless incur interest expense, which may be higher than any returns we are able to achieve through investing the proceeds, in our business or otherwise. In addition, we may be obliged to redeem this debt at a redemption price that exceeds the net proceeds to us from its initial issuance. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Visa Europe acquisition . Even if we complete the Visa Europe acquisition, a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits to us from the acquisition. For example: ##TABLE_START  the process of integrating Visa Europes operations into ours may be more difficult and/or may require more resources than we anticipate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may assume unexpected liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may face an increased risk of customer loss, for example if our European bank customers that were previously members of Visa Europe choose to expand business relationships with our competitors or otherwise support or engage in competing card or other payment solutions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties, commercial issues or conditions, and expenditures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we would become subject to EU and other regulations that govern the operations of Visa Europe, including new regulations governing the separation of scheme and processing that have not yet been fully defined, as well as any ongoing or future litigation involving Visa Europe; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain key personnel of Visa Europe; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the transaction may divert the time and resources of our senior management and disrupt our current operations to a greater degree than we currently contemplate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may not be able to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock in amounts sufficient to offset the dilution resulting from the preferred stock that we intend to issue as part of the acquisition consideration; and ##TABLE_END 27 ##TABLE_START  we may incur higher costs to finance the transaction than we currently contemplate. ##TABLE_END If we do not successfully implement the Visa Europe acquisition or the acquisition is not completed on the terms we currently contemplate, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively impacted. In particular, although we currently expect the Visa Europe acquisition to be mildly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2017 (before one-time integration costs), if the expenses associated with integrating Visa Europe into our operations and financing the acquisition are higher than we currently contemplate, if we fail to achieve our revenue expectations due to unexpected customer losses or otherwise, or if we do not achieve the benefits we anticipate from revenue synergies, cost savings, and increased repurchases of Class A common stock, we may not achieve this goal. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, payments totaling $426 million were made from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2015 .

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2015 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth. Visa Europe acquisition . On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement with Visa Europe, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to 21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of 11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately 5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to 4.0 billion (plus up to an additional 0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. In conjunction with the transaction agreement, the Visa Europe put option was amended to align the terms on which Visa Europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement. The purchase of Visa Europe's share capital will be effected through the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom. See Note 2Visa Europe , Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities , and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The closing of our acquisition of Visa Europe is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter of 2016. Financial highlights. During fiscal 2015, we recorded net income of $6.3 billion or diluted class A earnings per share of $2.58, an increase of 16% and 20% over the prior year, respectively. Our non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 6,438  $ 5,721  $ 4,980  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2),(3) $ 2.62  $ 2.27  $ 1.90  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END 33 ##TABLE_START (2)  Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END During fiscal 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. Our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities related to fiscal years 2013 and prior. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. We recorded net operating revenues of $13.9 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two-and-a-half- percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 4% over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of a $450 million litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation recorded in fiscal 2014. Excluding this provision, operating expenses increased by 6% over prior year adjusted operating expenses, primarily due to increases in personnel, additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure, and general and administrative expenses. The increases were partially offset by decreases in network and processing and marketing expenses. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of $110 million in the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating expense in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 2Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision.  Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END The following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015 (in millions, except for percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 4,816  %  $ 6,328  $ 2.58 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option      0.04 As adjusted $ 4,816  %  $ 6,438  $ 2.62 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported       2,457 ##TABLE_END34 ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014 (in millions, except for percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 5,005  %  $ 5,438  $ 2.16 Litigation provision (450 )  %   0.11 As adjusted $ 4,555  %  $ 5,721  $ 2.27 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported       2,523 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2013 (in millions, except for percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 4,539  %  $ 4,980  $ 1.90 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported       2,624 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total operating revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visas board of directors declared a four-for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 (\"Record Date\") received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2015 , we had remaining authorized funds of $2.8 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In October 2015 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion  share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015 (1) was 13% compared to 15% for the prior year comparable period. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 35 The following tables present nominal payments volume.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes consumer prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END 36 ##TABLE_START (4)  Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The following table provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, including transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS cards processed on Visa's networks during the fiscal periods presented.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As a result of recent changes in Russian National Payment System law, we have transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian National Payment Card System during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after the transition. ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  37 Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for legal, consulting and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Non-operating (Expense) Income Non-operating (expense) income mainly includes the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, income, gains and losses earned on investments, and accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 7,406  $ 6,847  $ 6,379  $  $  %  % International 6,219  5,629  5,177    %  % Visa Europe      %  % Total operating revenues $ 13,880  $ 12,702  $ 11,778  $ 1,178  $  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with higher foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues. 38 Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2015, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two-and-a-half percentage points in total operating revenue growth. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues.  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 6,302  $ 5,797  $ 5,352  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 5,552  5,167  4,642    %  % International transaction revenues 4,064  3,560  3,389    %  % Other revenues      %  % Client incentives (2,861 )  (2,592 )  (2,321 )  (269 )  (271 )  %  % Total operating revenues $ 13,880  $ 12,702  $ 11,778  $ 1,178  $  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Service revenues increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 primarily due to 7% and 9% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. Service revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 9% and 11% , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2014 increase was primarily due to 8% growth in nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 , reflecting overall growth in global payments volume as well as incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_END 39 Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 2,079  $ 1,875  $ 1,932  $  $ (57 )  %  (3 )% Marketing    (28 )   (3 )%  % Network and processing    (33 )   (7 )%  % Professional fees     (84 )  %  (20 )% Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative      %  % Litigation provision    (439 )   (97 )%  NM Total operating expenses (2) $ 4,816  $ 5,005  $ 4,539  $ (189 )  $  (4 )%  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Excluding the litigation provision of $450 million recorded in fiscal 2014 associated with litigation covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $4.6 billion . On an adjusted basis, the percentage change of fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 is an increase of 6%, and fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in internal technology resources, combined with higher incentive compensation. The decrease in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal 2013 , partially offset by an increase in headcount. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing decreased in fiscal 2015 mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by on-going advertising and promotional campaigns to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, which began in the second half of fiscal 2014. The increase in marketing during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was also attributable to elevated spend supporting the two sporting campaigns. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing in fiscal 2015 decreased as a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. The increase in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional fees in fiscal 2015 were flat compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal 2013 as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative increased in fiscal 2015 mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2015 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currency and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets. Fiscal 2014 increased mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses, and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities. ##TABLE_END 40 ##TABLE_START  Litigation provision in  fiscal 2014  reflects a $450 million  accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END Non-operating (Expense) Income Non-operating expense in fiscal 2015 primarily reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option of $110 million, which is not subject to tax. The change in value did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe would exercise its option in its unamended form at September 30, 2015. See Note 2Visa Europe  and  Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Non-operating income in fiscal 2014 increased from fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 . The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year: ##TABLE_START  a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million is a one-time $239 million tax benefit that relates to prior fiscal years; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following in fiscal 2014: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_END Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 41 Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:  ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 6,584  $ 7,205  $ 3,022 Investing activities (1,435 )  (941 )  (1,164 ) Financing activities (3,603 )  (6,478 )  (1,746 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  (1 )   Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,547  $ (215 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDOperating activiti es. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including: ##TABLE_START  payments of $426 million made from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid. ##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.9 billion, $6.5 billion, and $5.9 billion respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in all three years. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was greater during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by an increase in cash used to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities in fiscal 2014 include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million. Absent these impacts, which are related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, cash used in financing activities was $4.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities , Note 14Stockholders' Equity and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 42 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $7.0 billion at September 30, 2015 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued a U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $6.4 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.4 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1ARisk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2015 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit facility. On January 28, 2015 , we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 27, 2016 , replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 28, 2015 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2015 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018. Expected debt issuance and change in capital structure. In conjunction with the potential Visa Europe acquisition, we intend to evolve our long-term capital structure. We intend to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between $15.0 billion and $16.0 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2016, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years, depending on market conditions. The proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to fund the upfront cash consideration of the acquisition, and increase the repurchase of class A common stock outstanding in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effect of the expected issuance of preferred stock upon the closing of the acquisition. Our initial leverage is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. We expect our long-term leverage to be between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt to EBITDA, maintaining flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. We expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings disclosed below. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2015 , was $1.1 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. 43 Credit Ratings At September 30, 2015 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2015 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $272 million. Visa Europe acquisition. On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to  21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of 11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately 5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to 4.0 billion (plus up to an additional 0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See Note 2Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements . We also signed an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option agreement to reflect the terms of the transaction agreement. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, as described above, is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. The unamended put option agreement, if exercised, would require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. If the acquisition does not close and the put option reverts to its unamended terms, Visa Europe may exercise the unamended put option at any time thereafter. The unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the unamended option is exercised, to Visa Europe's adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, under the unamended terms, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option under its unamended terms, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2015, we determined the fair value of the unamended put option liability to be approximately $255 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised under its unamended terms. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. 44 Given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2015 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its put option in its unamended form, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2015 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 21.3 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.5 x. At September 30, 2015 , the spot P/E ratio was 23.2 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.8 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future in its unamended form. ##TABLE_START  Visa Incs Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio  Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $500 million (1)  Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $100 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $500 million     (in millions)  (in millions)    $12,500  $2,500    $10,000  $2,000    $7,500  $1,500  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. ##TABLE_END U.S. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2015 , we made $426 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with the individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. At September 30, 2015 , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.1 billion . See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  and  Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2015 , we had remaining authorized funds of $2.8 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In October 2015 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2015 , we paid $1.2 billion in dividends. In October 2015 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.14 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $341 million in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2015 . See Note 14Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Holders of class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also 45 sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $19 million , $14 million , and $4 million , respectively. In fiscal 2016 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $12 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2015 reflecting the investments to upgrade our processing network during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , we acquired businesses in which we previously held a minority interest using $93 million and $134 million of cash on hand, respectively. These amounts primarily reflect the respective purchase price, less cash received. These acquisitions help to expand our loyalty solutions for merchants by strengthening our merchant offers capabilities, and extend our processing capabilities internationally. See Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill  to our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2015 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $9.3 billion of assets and $268 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $262 million had significant unobservable inputs, including the unamended Visa Europe put option liability of $255 million , and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2015. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 46 ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $  $  $  $   $ 1,100 Leases (2)     Client incentives (3) 3,917  5,668  3,792  4,067  17,444 Marketing and sponsorship (4)     Dividends (5)        Total (6,7,8) $ 5,320  $ 6,226  $ 4,140  $ 4,245  $ 19,931 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to thirteen years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes expected dividend amount of $341 million as dividends were declared in October 2015 and will be paid on December 1, 2015 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 13, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $752 million . At September 30, 2015, we had also accrued $33 million of interest and $6 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  On November 2, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to 21.2 billion to be paid in a combination of up-front cash, preferred stock, and contingent cash consideration due four years after closing. As the agreement was signed after the balance sheet date, and closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, the maximum potential purchase price is not included in the table above. Additionally, in conjunction with the agreement to acquire Visa Europe, we also entered into an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option to align with the terms of the transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe. If the acquisition does not close, the Visa Europe put option will revert to its original, unamended terms. Due to the perpetual nature of the unamended instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist if the unamended put were exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its unamended option, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. The fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option itself totaling $255 million at September 30, 2015 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END 47 ##TABLE_START (8)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2015 , client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value  Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. On November 2, 2015, the Visa Europe put option was amended in conjunction with our agreement to acquire Visa Europe. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, described in Note 2Visa Europe , is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. If the put option is exercised under its unamended terms, we will be required to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The unamended put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. 48 The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise of the unamended put option, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the unamended agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's unamended option was estimated to be approximately $255 million at September 30, 2015 . While the unamended put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the unamended put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option in its unamended form. While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the unamended put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise Exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, including under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions (if any) to exercise the put option in its unamended form; (ii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iii) other qualitative factors including, but not limited to, qualitative factors related to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings 49 multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. Growth rates assumed in the valuation reflect a for-profit model, as we believe it is likely that, should Visa Europe choose to exercise the put option in its unamended form, it will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the unamended put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the unamended put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.5 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $37 million in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $249 million in the value of the unamended put option. The unamended put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2015 . Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months at September 30, 2015 . Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2015. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by 50 the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2015 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $91 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2015 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2015 and 2014 were $4.4 billion and $3.0 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $48 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2015 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe, which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2015 based on its unamended terms. We are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary. In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015 , we assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.5 x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $37 million in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $249 51 million in the value of the unamended put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $1.0 billion and $983 million , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $248 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $30 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2016 , if any, which would be made in September 2016. 52 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ##TABLE_START    Page As of September 30, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_END53 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Visa Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2015 . We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP Santa Clara, California November 19, 2015  54 VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2015 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\") and Inovant LLC (\"Inovant\") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (the \"October 2007 reorganization\" or \"reorganization\"). See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Beginning in fiscal 2015, current income tax receivable is included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line. Previously, it had been presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts within the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The reclassification did not affect the Company's financial position, total operating revenues, net income, comprehensive income, or cash flows as of and for the periods presented. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Restricted cashlitigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities include auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, and the Visa Europe put option. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17Commitments and Contingencies . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2015 . See Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2015 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2015 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2015 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2015 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see  Note 2Visa Europe ), fees from account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a \"bond duration matching\" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for plans in the United States. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2015, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company  indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region, as described in Note 2Visa Europe . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for 70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2013-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018.The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the full effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. Subsequently, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, which adds SEC staff guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, allowing for the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company will adopt the standards effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which provides guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment will help entities evaluate whether such an arrangement includes a software license, which should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The Company will adopt the standard 71 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, which simplifies the accounting for post-acquisition adjustments by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for the adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The Company plans to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2Visa Europe  Acquisition of Visa Europe On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Visa Europe agreed on the terms and conditions of the Companys acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to  21.2 billion . The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of  11.5 billion and preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock of the Company, as described below, valued at approximately  5.0 billion , and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to  4.0 billion (plus up to an additional  0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. The board of directors of the Company and Visa Europe have each unanimously supported the transaction agreement and the matters contemplated thereby. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Transaction agreement and option amendment . The transaction agreement provides for the acquisition to be effected pursuant to the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option, as described further below. In connection with the execution of the transaction agreement, the Company and Visa Europe have amended the Visa Europe put option to align the terms on which Visa Europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement, including the economic terms and timing. The transaction agreement prohibits Visa Europe from exercising the put option prior to closing of the transaction and, if the transaction agreement is terminated without completion of the acquisition, the Visa Europe put option will revert to its original, unamended form. The transaction agreement may be terminated by the Company or Visa Europe, subject to specified exceptions, if the transaction is not consummated by August 2, 2016, or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and non-appealable. Preferred stock . In connection with the transaction, the board of directors of the Company has authorized the creation of three new series of preferred stock of the Company: ##TABLE_START  series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is designed to be economically equivalent to the Companys class A common stock (the class A equivalent preferred stock); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the U.K.I preferred stock); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Europe preferred stock). ##TABLE_END The transaction agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, at closing, the Company will issue 2,480,500 shares of U.K.I preferred stock to those of Visa Europes member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing, and 3,157,000 shares of Europe preferred stock to those of Visa Europes other member financial institutions that are entitled to receive preferred stock at closing. Subject to the reduction in conversion rates described below, the U.K.I preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately  2.2 billion and the Europe preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately  2.8 billion . These approximate values of the UKI and Europe preferred stock to be issued at closing are based on the average price of the class A common stock of $71.68 per share, and the euro-dollar exchange rate of 1.12750 for the 30 trading days ended October 19, 2015. 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 The UKI and Europe preferred stock will be convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K.I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. A reduction in the conversion rates of the U.K.I preferred stock and the Europe preferred stock have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock because it reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. Additionally, the shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock will be subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the existing and potential litigation. The shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . Upon issuance of the preferred stock at closing, the holders of the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock will have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock. With respect to those limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the holders of the preferred stock requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. Once issued, all three series of preferred stock will participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. U.K. loss sharing agreement and litigation management deed . On November 2, 2015, the Company, Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the U.K. LSA members) entered into a loss sharing agreement (the U.K. loss sharing agreement), pursuant to which each of the U.K. LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each U.K. LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration to be received by such U.K. LSA member. The U.K. LSA members obligations under the U.K. loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, the acquisition closing, and additionally upon either (a) losses valued at in excess of the sterling equivalent at closing of  1.0 billion having arisen in claims relating to the U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees (with such losses being recoverable through reductions in the conversion rate of the U.K.I preferred stock), or (b) the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory, as described above. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . Prior to closing, the Company and the other parties thereto will enter into a litigation management deed, which will set forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the existing and potential litigation, as described above, relating to the setting and implementation of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the \"Europe covered claims\"), the allocation of losses resulting from the Europe covered claims, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the Europe covered claims, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with newly established Europe litigation management committees. The Europe litigation management committees, which will be composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, will also be granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the Europe covered claims. Historical Relationship with Visa Europe As part of Visa's October 2007 reorganization, Visa Europe exchanged its ownership interest in Visa International and Inovant for Visa common stock , a put-call option agreement and a Framework Agreement, as described below. While the Visa Europe put option agreement has been amended by the option amendment 73 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 described above, the Visa Europe put option agreement will revert to its original, unamended form if the transaction agreement is terminated without completion of the acquisition. Visa Europe put option agreement. As discussed above, on November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe amended the Visa Europe put option. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. The unamended put option agreement, if exercised, would require Visa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The Company is required to purchase the shares of Visa Europe no later than 285 days after exercise of the unamended put option. The unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the unamended option is exercised, to Visa Europe's adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, under the unamended terms, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option under its unamended terms, which, under certain conditions, could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. The fair value of the unamended put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion . While the unamended put option is in fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company's estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the unamended put option agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's-length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe may never exercise its option in its unamended form. The estimated fair value of the unamended put option represents a Level 3 accounting estimate due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The valuation of the unamended put option therefore requires substantial judgment. The most subjective of estimates applied in valuing the unamended put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated differential between the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which the Company refers to as the P/E differential. Exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, including under its Articles of Association). The Company estimates the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions (if any) to exercise the put option in its unamended form; (ii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iii) other qualitative factors including, but not limited to, qualitative factors related to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. Factors impacting the assumed P/E differential used in the calculation include material changes in the P/E ratio of Visa and those of a group of comparable companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. The Company determined the fair value of the unamended put option to be approximately $255 million at September 30, 2015 and $145 million  at  September 30, 2014 . The increase in value was primarily driven by an 74 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 increase in estimated Visa Europe adjusted sustainable income partially offset by a decrease in the P/E differential. In determining the fair value of the unamended put option on these dates, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 1.5 x and 1.9 x, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the put option are recorded as non-cash, non-operating expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2015, the unamended put option was exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2015 . Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months at September 30, 2015 . Visa call option agreement. Visa Europe granted to Visa a perpetual call option under which the Company may be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering events. These triggering events involve the performance of Visa Europe measured as an unremediated decline in the number of merchants or ATM's in the Visa Europe region that accepts Visa-branded products. The Company believes the likelihood of these events occurring is remote. The Framework Agreement. Subject to the binding documents entered into in connection with the proposed transaction, the relationship between Visa and Visa Europe is governed by a Framework Agreement, which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services as described below. The Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system. Visa Europe may sublicense the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property to its members and other sublicensees under agreed-upon circumstances. The base fee for these irrevocable and perpetual licenses is recorded in other revenues and was approximately $143 million per year for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . This fee is eligible for adjustment annually based on the annual growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, although the adjustment can never reduce the annual fee below $143 million . The Company determined through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the agreement that the base fee, as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the European Union, approximates fair value. In addition to the licenses, Visa provides Visa Europe with authorization, clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions involving Visa Europe's region and the rest of the world. Visa Europe must comply with certain agreed-upon global rules governing the interoperability of Visa's systems with the systems of Visa Europe as well as the use and interoperability of the Visa trademarks. The parties will also guarantee the obligations of their respective clients and members to settle transactions, manage certain relationships with sponsors, clients and merchants, and comply with rules relating to the operation of the Visa enterprise. Under the Framework Agreement, the Company indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Companys or Visa Europes activities that are brought outside of Visa Europes region; and Visa Europe likewise indemnifies the Company for such claims brought within Visa Europes region. However, Visa Europe has informed us of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify the Company or Visa International for any claim relating to the European Competition Proceedings, including claims asserted in both the European Commission matter and the U.K. Merchant Litigation. The Company continues to firmly believe that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify the Company for all such claims. See Note 20Legal Matters . The Company has not recorded liabilities associated with these obligations as the fair value of such obligations was determined to be insignificant at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company has determined that the value of services exchanged as a result of these various agreements approximates fair value at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 75 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities  U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the U.S. covered litigation.\" These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan, and consist of a litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement, and an omnibus agreement, as amended. U.S. covered litigation consists of: ##TABLE_START  the Discover Litigation . Discover Financial Services Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., Case No. 04-CV-07844 (S.D.N.Y) (settled); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the American Express Litigation . American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A.

Visa U.S.A., Inc. et al., Case No. CO4-4276 JSW (N.D. Cal.); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any case brought after October 22, 2015, by an opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. ##TABLE_END Litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the litigation escrow account: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 1,498  $ Return of takedown payments from settlement fund into the litigation escrow account   1,056 Deposits into the litigation escrow account   Payments to opt-out merchants (1) (426 )  (57 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,072  $ 1,498 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 20Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available 76 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2015. See Note 20Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. 77 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class Settlement Agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the Settlement Agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. Potential Visa Europe Liabilities On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Visa Europe. Closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Visa Inc., Visa Europe or their affiliates are, or may become, a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. The background to the existing proceedings is within European Competition Proceedings and U.K. Merchant Litigation in Note 20Legal Matters . The Company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the U.K. loss sharing agreement, and has agreed to certain terms regarding the conduct of such litigation, all of which is conditioned on the closing of the acquisition of Visa Europe by the Company.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Commercial paper and foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2015 . Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There 79 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2015 . Visa Europe put option agreement. On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe amended the Visa Europe put option. At September 30, 2015 , the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. The fair value of the unamended put option was $255 million at September 30, 2015 and $145 million at September 30, 2014 . Changes in fair value are recorded as non-cash, non-operating expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2Visa Europe . The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated P/E differential are among several unobservable inputs used to value the unamended put option. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The Company recognized a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss related to these investments during fiscal 2013 . There were no significant impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 . At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , these investments totaled $45 million and $35 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2015 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2015 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2015 , but require disclosure of their fair values: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable, and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2015 , approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 80 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Investments Trading Investment Securities Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014 , trading investment securities totaled $66 million and $69 million , respectively.

The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Total consideration under the license agreement was approximately $15 million , of which $12 million was recorded as goodwill. Subsequently, in April 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of the strategic partner. The total purchase consideration was approximately $116 million , excluding the Company's previously held minority interest, paid primarily with cash on hand. Total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value on the acquisition date. Related finite-lived intangible assets recorded, comprised primarily of customer relationships, totaled $13 million with a weighted-average useful life of 6.7 years. Goodwill of $72 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired. In April 2014, the Company acquired a business in which it previously held a minority interest. Total purchase consideration was approximately $170 million , paid primarily with cash on hand. Total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Related indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled $126 million . Goodwill of $60 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets assumed. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition. Pro forma information related to the acquisitions have not been presented as the impacts are not material to the Company's financial results. 84 VISA INC.

At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms, and the unamended put option was exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe with payment required 285 days thereafter. Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the unamended instrument could become payable within 12 months at September 30, 2015 . The fair value of the unamended put option does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised in its unamended form, which would likely be in excess of $15 billion . During fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of $110 million in the fair value of the unamended put option. See Note 2Visa Europe . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The decrease in non-current accrued income taxes is primarily related to decreases in liabilities for uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END Note 9Debt  Commercial paper program. Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2015 . Credit facility. On January 28, 2015 , the Company entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). The Credit Facility, which expires on January 27, 2016 , replaced the Company's previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 28, 2015 . The Credit Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The participating lenders in the Credit Facility include affiliates of certain holders of the Company's class B and class C common stock and some of the Company's clients or affiliates of its clients. This facility is maintained to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by the Company's clients, to back up the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Visa also agreed to pay a commitment fee, which will fluctuate based 85 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 on the credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.00% to 0.75% depending on the type of the loan, and the commitment fee is 0.07% . There were no borrowings under either facility and the Company was in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended and as of September 30, 2015 . Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations, which are not presented below as they are not material. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The benefits under the current defined benefit pension plan are earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. The funding policy is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Postretirement benefits plan. The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65 . Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2021 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million . Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The current target allocation for pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2015 , pension plan asset allocations for the above categories were 66% , 33% and 1% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2015 and 2014 , including the impact of unsettled transactions: ##TABLE_START   Fair Value Measurements at September 30,   Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total            (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $          $  $ Corporate debt securities     $  $       U.S. government-sponsored debt securities (1)            U.S. Treasury securities (1)            Asset-backed securities         $  $   Equity securities            Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,022  $ 1,117 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  U.S. Treasury securities are Level 1 assets, but were previously presented in aggregate with U.S. government-sponsored debt securities as Level 2. The Company now presents U.S. Treasury securities separately for disclosure purposes. There were no changes to the valuation techniques or related inputs used to measure fair value. Prior period amounts reflect the change in presentation. ##TABLE_END Level 1 assets. Cash equivalents (money market funds), U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. 89 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Level 2 assets. The fair values of U.S. government-sponsored and corporate debt securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2015 or 2014 , except for the change in presentation noted above. A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.

Personnel costs included $49 million , $46 million and $44 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the 401(k) plan. The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure decreased to approximately $43.5 billion for 90 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 the period ended September 30, 2015 , compared to $56.9 billion for the period ended September 30, 2014 . The decrease in the Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure for the period ended September 30, 2015 is due to recent changes in the Visa Rules that reduced the number of transactions covered by its settlement indemnification. Of these amounts, $2.2 billion and $3.2 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2015  September 30, 2014  (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,023  $ Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,178  1,242 Guarantees  1,554 Total $ 3,326  $ 3,905 ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimum losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $1 million and $2 million at September 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 12Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company maintains a rolling cash flow hedge program with the objective of reducing exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues derived from and payments made in non-functional currencies during the following twelve months. The aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program were $1.2 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . As of September 30, 2015 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $76 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $13 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. 91 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $29 million , $27 million and $14 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $117 million pre-tax gains to earnings during fiscal 2016. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements which require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2015 , the Company has received collateral of $73 million from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and posted collateral of $4 million , which is included in other assets. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2015 . Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2015  September 30, 2014  (in millions) United States $ 1,806  $ 1,798 International  Total $ 1,888  $ 1,892 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 53% of total operating revenues in fiscal 2015 , and 54% in fiscal 2014  and  2013 . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Note 14Stockholders' Equity  Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visas board of directors declared a four -for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 (\"Record Date\"), received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares 92 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. As a result of the stock split, all historical per share data and number of shares outstanding presented have been retroactively adjusted. As-converted class A common stock.

As of September 30, 2015 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $2.8 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In October 2015 , the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. Under the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014 .

The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2015 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions, and 132 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and it has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had no shares of preferred stock outstanding during and at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the board of directors authorized the creation of three new series of preferred stock to be issued upon closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 2Visa Europe . Voting rights. Holders of class A common stock have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Holders of class B and C common stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including any decision to exit the core payments business and, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company, in which case the holders of class B and C common stock are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $1.2 billion in dividends in fiscal 2015 at a quarterly rate of $0.12 per share. In October 2015 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 1, 2015 , to all holders of record of the Companys class A, B and C common stock as of November 13, 2015 . 94 VISA INC.

Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four -for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Net income attributable to Visa Inc. is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average numbers of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were 405 million for fiscal 2015 and 413 million  for fiscal 2014 and 2013 . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 87 million , 103 million and 113 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 6 million , 7 million and 8 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, because their effect ##TABLE_END 95 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_START (4)  The outstanding number of shares of class B and C common stock were not impacted by the stock split as these stockholders received an adjustment to their respective conversion ratios instead of stock dividends. See  Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding for class B and C common stock are calculated based on the common shares outstanding of each respective class rather than on an as-converted basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. ##TABLE_END Note 16Share-based Compensation  2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 236 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. No awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost of $184 million , $172 million and $179 million , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were $54 million , $51 million and $53 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding presented below reflect the four -for-one stock split that was effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START     Expected term (in years) (1)  4.55  4.80  6.08 Risk-free rate of return (2)  1.5 %  1.3 %  0.8 % Expected volatility (3)  22.0 %  25.2 %  29.3 % Expected dividend yield (4)  0.8 %  0.8 %  0.9 % Fair value per option granted  $ 12.04  $ 11.03  $ 9.76 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Beginning in fiscal 2014, assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2015 was ##TABLE_END 96 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 approximately 67% and 33% , respectively, and the relative weighting in fiscal 2014 was 58% and 42% , respectively. In fiscal 2013, assumption was fully based on peer companies' data. ##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility. The expected volatilities ranged from 21% to 23% in fiscal 2015 . In fiscal 2013, historical volatility was a blend of Visa's historical volatility and those of comparable peer companies. The relative weighting between Visa historical volatility and the historical volatility of the peer companies was based on the percentage of years Visa stock price information is available since its initial public offering compared to the expected term. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the Companys option activity for fiscal 2015 : ##TABLE_START  Options  Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at October 1, 2014 11,649,704  $ 22.52     Granted 1,444,376  $ 62.87     Forfeited (379,662 )  $ 50.53     Exercised (3,036,701 )  $ 20.53     Outstanding at September 30, 2015 9,677,717  $ 28.07  5.0  $402 Options exercisable at September 30, 2015 7,083,305  $ 18.26  3.7  $364 Options exercisable and expected to vest at September 30, 2015 (2) 9,392,332  $ 27.26  4.9  $398 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2015 of $69.66 , less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Applies a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30, 2015 to estimate the options expected to vest in the future. ##TABLE_END For the options exercised during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the total intrinsic value was $134 million , $187 million and $176 million , respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $86 million , $65 million and $59 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2015 , there was $17 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $63.71 , $49.98 and $36.80 , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $62.88 , $49.44 and $36.55 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $132 million , $126 million and $98 million , respectively. 97 VISA INC.

Performance-based Shares The following table summarizes the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned and related activity for fiscal 2015 : ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at October 1, 2014 2,075,240  $ 44.32     Granted (2) 785,884  $ 69.78     Vested and earned (1,221,020 )  $ 42.68     Unearned (24,924 )  $ 42.68     Forfeited (351,218 )  $ 54.25     Outstanding at September 30, 2015 1,263,962  $ 57.61  0.7  $88 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2015 of $69.66 by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. ##TABLE_END For the Company's performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of shares to be earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $69.78 , $56.37 and $41.04 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 vest approximately 3 years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2015 , there was $11 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.7 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In January 2015, the Company's class A stockholders approved the Visa Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), under which substantially all employees are eligible to participate. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase the Companys class A common stock at a 15% discount of the stock price on the purchase date, subject to certain restrictions. A total of 20 million shares of class A common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The first offering date was April 1, 2015. The ESPP does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 17Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $136 million , $134 million and $94 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2015 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START       Thereafter  Total  (in millions) Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Marketing and sponsorships       Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,046 ##TABLE_ENDSelect sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2015 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 3,237  $ 3,130  $ 2,670  $ 2,205  $ 1,610  $ 3,965  $ 16,817 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 18Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. There were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2015 and 2014 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2015 , the Company had $30 million federal, $19 million state and $177 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2028 through 2035 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. 101 VISA INC.

At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , income taxes payable of $75 million and $73 million , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $752 million and $855 million , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 8Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to $6.4 billion at September 30, 2015 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $192 million , $168 million and $158 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.08 , $0.07 and $0.06 in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

The Company reversed $6 million of interest expense in fiscal 2015 and recognized $10 million and $9 million of interest expense in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued $1 million and $2 million of penalties in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, and reversed $4 million of penalties in fiscal 2013, related to uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had accrued interest of $33 million and $39 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $6 million and $5 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities.  The Company's fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") examination. The Company has filed a federal refund claim for fiscal year 2008, which is also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claim, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2009. The Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 California tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\") completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Company's fiscal 2010 through 2014 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. The Company intends to petition the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRA's assessments, and continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 103 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Note 20Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 1,456  $ Reestablishment of obligation related to interchange multidistrict litigation   1,056 Additional provision for legal matters  Payments on legal matters (446 )  (58 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,024  $ 1,456 ##TABLE_ENDU.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the activity related to U.S. covered litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 1,449  $  Reestablishment of obligation related to interchange multidistrict litigation   1,056 Additional provision for interchange opt-out litigation   Payments on covered litigation (426 )  (57 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,023  $ 1,449 ##TABLE_ENDOn January 14, 2014, the MDL 1720 court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Following the payment of approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into settlement funds pursuant to the class settlement agreement, on January 27, 2014, Visa received and deposited into the Company's litigation escrow account \"takedown payments\" of approximately $1.1 billion , which Visa was entitled to receive under the class settlement agreement based on payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who opted out. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with 104 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling $57 million  and  $426 million were made in fiscal 2014 and 2015, respectively, from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $1.0 billion related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2015. See further discussion below under Interchange Opt-out Litigation and Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their \"no surcharge\" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which, together with the complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. The Company and the individual merchants whose claims were consolidated with the MDL (the \"Individual Plaintiffs\") signed a settlement agreement to resolve the Individual Plaintiffs' claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the litigation escrow account on October 29, 2012, and the court has dismissed those claims with prejudice. In addition, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include, among other terms: ##TABLE_START  A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have been paid to issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances, subject to a cap and a level playing field with other general purpose card competitors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Agreement that the Company will meet with merchant buying groups that seek to negotiate interchange rates collectively. ##TABLE_END On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors have appealed. Until the appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard argument in the objectors' appeals on September 28, 2015. 105 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 On January 14, 2015, following a court-approved process to give class members who previously opted out of the damages portion of the class settlement an option to rejoin it, the class administrator reported that it had received 1,179 requests by merchants to rejoin the cash settlement class, some of which may include multiple merchants. On July 28, 2015, certain objectors to the class settlement asked the court to vacate or set aside its final judgment approving the settlement, or in the alternative, to grant further discovery, in light of communications between one of MasterCard's former lawyers and one of the lawyers for the class plaintiffs. Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 16, 2013, a putative class action was filed on behalf of all Visa and MasterCard payment cardholders in the United States since January 1, 2000 against certain financial institutions, identifying non-defendants Visa, MasterCard, and certain other financial institutions as co-conspirators. Plaintiffs allege primarily a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys fees, and treble damages in excess of $54.0 billion dollars annually arising from purported overcharges. Originally filed in federal court in California, the case was transferred to MDL 1720. On November 26, 2014, the MDL court dismissed plaintiffs' federal law claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state law claim. Both sides have asked the court to reconsider aspects of its decision and have filed notices of appeal. Interchange Opt-out Litigation Beginning in May 2013, more than 50 opt-out cases have been filed by hundreds of merchants in various federal district courts, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments, and one of the cases seeks an injunction against the fixed acquirer network fee. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries filed an opt-out complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants. Visa has acknowledged and confirmed its obligations to indemnify Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. with respect to the claim against them in Wal-Marts complaint. Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the Settlement Agreement. In addition, Visa filed three more similar complaints in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; against The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A.; and against Sears Holdings Corporation. All four complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs may seek damages under the Settlement Agreement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its \"honor all cards\" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. All the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been or expect to be transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . Visa has reached a settlement agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries, which will terminate if, following all appeals, the MDL class settlement is reversed or vacated with respect to certification of the Rule 23(b)(2) settlement class or the consideration provided to or release provided by that class. Including this settlement 106 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 with Wal-Mart, as of the date of filing, Visa has reached settlement agreements with a number of merchants representing approximately 48% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out. On December 23, 2014, a similar case was filed in New Mexico state court by New Mexico's attorney general on behalf of the state, state agencies, and citizens of the state, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On May 15, 2015, defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and, among other things, narrowed the state antitrust damages claims. While the Company believes that it has substantial defenses in these matters, the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of individual opt-out claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. European Competition Proceedings European Commission. Following the European Commission's (\"EC\") issuance in 2009 of a Statement of Objections, the EC announced a supplementary Statement of Objections (\"SSO\") on July 31, 2012, concerning interchange for consumer credit card transactions; and, on March 8, 2013, a redacted version of the SSO was served on Visa Inc. and Visa International. The SSO alleges a breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. Among other things, the SSO asserts claims jointly against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International, objecting to domestic, cross-border, and inter-regional interchange, and Visa Europe's cross-border acquiring and point of sale rules. The SSO also announces the EC's intention to impose fines. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. On February 26, 2014, the EC adopted a formal decision accepting Visa Europes commitments addressing domestic interchange, cross-border interchange for credit card transactions within Europe, and cross-border acquiring within Europe, and made the commitments legally binding on Visa Europe. The EC continues the proceedings in respect of inter-regional interchange fees that apply to transactions involving a Visa credit cardholder from outside the Visa Europe territory and a merchant in the European Economic Area (EEA). These interchange fees are set by Visa Inc. U.K. Merchant Litigation . Since July 2013, approximately 20 merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe (used in this U.K. Merchant Litigation section to denote Visa Europe Limited and/or relevant subsidiary/affiliate companies), Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct primarily in relation to U.K. domestic and/or Irish domestic and/or intra-EEA interchange fees for credit and debit cards. After a successful application for summary judgment in the High Court (Commercial Court) and an unsuccessful appeal by the claimants, the claims of U.K. merchants should be limited to the six year period immediately preceding the issuance of each claim. In addition, since March 2013, in excess of 20 additional merchants (together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have threatened to commence proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. Visa Europe, Visa Inc., and Visa International entered into standstill agreements with respect to some of those merchants claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. Altogether, therefore, merchants accounting for more than 50% of U.K. retail sales have either filed claims or preserved their right to do so. The amount of interchange being challenged is substantial. Although not all of the merchant claims have been served and thus the full scope of the claims is not yet known, and there are substantial defenses to these claims, the total damages sought in the claims that have been served amount to several billion dollars. The Company has learned that several additional European merchants have indicated that they may bring claims against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and/or Visa International with respect to interchange rates in Europe. We anticipate that similar claims may be asserted by additional merchants in the future. 107 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 In our view, pursuant to the parties' agreements, Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and Visa International in connection with the European Competition Proceeding and the U.K. Merchant Litigation, including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed. However, Visa Europe has informed Visa Inc. of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. or Visa International for these claims. The parties have initiated the executive engagement aspect of the dispute resolution procedure contemplated by the Framework Agreement to resolve this dispute. If the acquisition of Visa Europe is not completed, this dispute may continue. However, if the acquisition is completed, Visa Europe will become wholly owned by Visa Inc. In these circumstances, Visa Inc.'s protection in respect of losses suffered pursuant to the claims which are covered by the transaction protections described in Note 2Visa Europe and Note 3U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities will be pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock and/or the U.K. loss sharing agreement. If claims are not covered by these transactional protections, Visa Europe may have recourse under its membership documents against members under the terms of the existing indemnity arrangements (other than in respect of certain claims relating to U.K. domestic multilateral interchange fees). Other Litigation \"Indirect Purchaser\" Actions From 2000 to 2004, complaints were filed on behalf of consumers in nineteen different states and the District of Columbia against Visa and MasterCard. The complaints alleged, among other things, that Visa's \"honor all cards\" rule and a similar MasterCard rule violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws, and common law. The claims in these class actions asserted that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive relief. Visa has been successful in the majority of these cases, and has resolved the cases in all jurisdictions but California. In California, the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases were resolved pursuant to a revised settlement agreement that received final approval and was affirmed on appeal. Certain objectors filed petitions for rehearing and for review by the California Supreme Court that were denied on February 11, 2015, and the judgment approving the settlement agreement is now final. One objector has appealed the trial court's orders regarding the distribution of certain settlement funds, and the denial of that objector's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. Canadian Competition Proceedings Merchant Litigation . Beginning in December 2010, a number of putative class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard, and ten financial institutions on behalf of purported classes of merchants and others that accept payment by Visa and MasterCard. In Saskatchewan, a separate action was filed against Visa Canada Corporation and Visa Inc., two MasterCard entities, and a number of smaller Canadian issuing banks that are not named as defendants in any of the existing proceedings. The lawsuits allege a violation of Section 45 of Canada's Competition Act and assert claims of civil conspiracy, interference with economic interests, and unjust enrichment, among others. Plaintiffs allege that Visa and MasterCard each conspired with their member financial institutions to set supra-competitive default interchange rates and merchant discount fees, and that Visa and MasterCard's respective \"no-surcharge\" and \"honor all cards\" policies had the anticompetitive effect of increasing merchant discount fees. Three of the named financial institutions, which are not significant Canadian issuers, have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, subject to court approval. On March 26, 2014, the British Columbia Supreme Court, in Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. , granted the plaintiffs' application for class certification in part, allowing plaintiffs to proceed as a class on claims for price fixing under Canada's Competition Act, among other claims. On appeal by both plaintiff and defendants, the British Columbia Court of Appeal permitted the class to proceed with its price-fixing and other claims, while striking out certain claims and ordering reconsideration of certification as it relates to one of the bank defendants. The lawsuits in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan are effectively stayed pending further proceedings in the British Columbia lawsuit. The pending Canada Merchant Litigation lawsuits largely seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief, but some allege substantial damages. 108 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Dynamic Currency Conversion On February 4, 2013, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (\"ACCC\") commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against several Visa entities asserting violations of Australian competition law based on allegations of restrictions on dynamic currency conversion (DCC) services on Visa international payment card transactions at certain Australian merchant outlets from May 2010 to October 2010, and on DCC services on cash withdrawals using Visa international payment cards at Australian ATMs. The parties reached an agreement to resolve the proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement, on September 4, 2015, the court ordered Visa to pay a pecuniary penalty of AUD $18 million and costs of AUD $2 million based on a single contravention of section 47(2) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) for conduct concerning certain Australian merchant outlets from May to October 2010. The court dismissed all other claims asserted by the ACCC. Data Pass Litigation On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in Connecticut federal district court, seeking damages, restitution, and injunctive relief on the grounds that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were allegedly deceived into incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (\"data pass\"), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. On October 15, 2015, the court dismissed the case in its entirety, without leave to replead. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on November 12, 2015. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . On October 12, 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A., and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek damages \"in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling,\" injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint against the same defendants, also asserting that the ATM access fee rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs request treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. These putative class actions seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. On February 13, 2013, the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of these cases without prejudice, and later denied plaintiffs motions for leave to amend and to alter the court's judgment. On plaintiffs' appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the lower court's decisions and remanded for further proceedings. On September 3, 2015, defendants filed a petition seeking panel rehearing or rehearing en banc before the appellate court, which was denied on September 28, 2015. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \" Division \" ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or \" CID, \" to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. 109 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2015 Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter On September 21, 2012, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \" Bureau \" ) requested that Visa provide on a voluntary basis documents and information regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section 920(b)(1)(B) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693o-2, and Regulation II, 12 C.F.R.  235.7(b) (commonly known as the Durbin Amendment and regulations). The request focuses on information related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. The revenue generated by the PIN Debit Gateway Service is not material to the Companys financial statements. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau and responding to its information requests. Pulse Network On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse also alleges that Visa has entered into agreements in restraint of trade, engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing and tying, violated the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act, and engaged in tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visa's conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit, and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On January 23, 2015, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Note 21Subsequent Events On November 2, 2015, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a transaction agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Visa Europe agreed on the terms and conditions of the Companys acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. See Note 2Visa Europe . In October 2015  , the Company's board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . In October 2015 , the Companys board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.14 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis).

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2015 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2015 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2015 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2015 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business OVERVIEW Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We enable global commerce through the transfer of value and information among these participants. Our advanced transaction processing network facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Our vision is to be the best way to pay and be paid for everyone, everywhere. To deliver on this vision, we focus on six strategic goals: ##TABLE_START  Evolve our client interactions to build deeper partnerships with financial institutions, merchants and new industry partners; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transform Visas technology assets to drive efficiency and enable innovation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Achieve success as a leading partner for digital payments comparable to what we have achieved in the physical world; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Expand access to Visa products and services globally; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Champion payment system security for the industry; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Be the employer of choice for top talent. ##TABLE_END Visa is one of the worlds largest retail electronic payments network based on payments volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation. Visa Network * Total volume includes Europe for the fourth quarter. Visa operates in a four party model, which includes card issuing financial institutions, acquirers and merchants. We are not a bank and do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, our financial institution clients are responsible for and manage account holder and merchant relationships. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we do not receive as revenue any of the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by the acquirers. 4 Visa Brand The Visa brand is one of the most well-known and valuable brands in the world. Anchored on the notion that Visa is 'everywhere you want to be,' the brand stands for acceptance, security, convenience and universality. In recognition of its strength among clients and consumers, the Visa brand is ranked highly in a number of widely recognized brand studies, including the 2016 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Study (#6), Interbrands 2016 Best Global Brands (#61) and Forbes 2016 Worlds Most Valuable Brands (#30). We leverage our brand strength to deliver added value to financial institutions, merchants and other clients through compelling brand expressions, expanded products and services, and innovative marketing efforts. Payment Security Security is critical to maintaining trust and confidence in electronic payments. To ensure that Visa remains one of the safest ways to pay and be paid, we deploy a multi-layered security approach focused on eliminating vulnerable data from the payments environment, securing the data that remains, preventing fraud and empowering system participants to protect themselves. This approach has historically kept fraud rates low as payment volumes have grown. With commerce moving to digital channels, we are investing in new technologies and solutions in order to maintain the trust that consumers, clients and merchants place in Visa. This requires innovation, leadership and cross-industry collaboration. 5 Fiscal 2016 Key Statistics *Please see Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of our adjusted financial results. KEY INITIATIVES Visa Europe Acquisition .  Prior to our 2007 reorganization, Visa operated as a collection of member-owned associations, with each region serving its member financial institutions and administering Visa programs within a global framework. In 2007, Visa reorganized, with all of the regions except Visa Europe coming together to form Visa Inc., a Delaware corporation. Visa Europe remained owned by its European member financial institutions.  On June 21, 2016, we acquired Visa Europe. We believe the acquisition positions our Company to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by integration of the businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from a member-owned association to a for-profit enterprise. We plan to bring Visa's global capabilities to our European clients, deliver a more seamless experience operating as one single global company and grow our business in that region. As part of the acquisition, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for 12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and 5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) in preferred stock, with an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, to be paid on June 21, 2019. Capital Structure .  In December 2015, we issued $16 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging between two and 30 years, and in June 2016, we issued two new series of preferred stock to Visa Europe's member financial institutions that are convertible into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock as part of the Visa Europe transaction. We also have plans to raise an additional $2 billion in debt by the end of calendar year 2016, subject to market conditions. Technology Transformation. At its heart, Visa is a technology company. With the intensifying digital economy and the ubiquity of mobile technology, data and enhanced security driving the future of payments, we embarked on a multi-year journey in 2015 to transform technology at Visa with the main areas of focus on opening our network and creating a digital platform for innovation while at the same time adding layers of security and operational resilience. We have executed on our workforce plan by hiring a total of 1,700 technology employees globally over the past two years, including nearly 750 new college graduates, replacing a significant percentage of our contractor and vendor spend. We are making steady progress on our technology strategic roadmap, resulting in enhanced services for our ecosystem stakeholders and positive impacts to our infrastructure. Since the launch of Visas Developer Platform (VDP) in 2015, more than 180 of Visas product or service functions are available in API or application program interface format to our clients and partners. We added new services to enable clients to develop support for tokenized transactions and create new and innovative solutions in mobile, ecommerce and digital face-to-face transactions. Cybersecurity remains a top focus and in fiscal 2016 we launched our new Threat Intelligence Fusion Platform, a cyber command and control center that provides integrated cybersecurity operations to further help protect our data and assets. At the same time, new open technologies have been added 6 systematically to our infrastructure and platform components and we continue to bolster the resiliency of our infrastructure and application services to provide high availability of our services for our clients. How We Work with Partners - Innovation Centers, VDP  API Suite. To drive new technologies in the payments space and accelerate the proliferation of safe and fast digital payments, we opened new innovation centers in Dubai, Miami and Singapore in fiscal 2016. Along with the San Francisco innovation center and European innovation hubs in London, Tel Aviv and Berlin, these centers foster collaboration with our financial institution clients, partners and developers across the regions to spur creation of the next generation of payments and commerce applications and solutions. In 2016, VDP became generally available, offered application developers around the globe access to Visa technology, services and tools, and provided safe testing environments for the development of new digital payments and commerce solutions. By exposing new and modified APIs through a variety of channels, Visa has made digital payment solutions available to support hundreds of financial institutions and technology partners such as Google, Microsoft and Samsung. PRODUCTS  SERVICES Core Products Debit: Debit cards are issued by banks to allow consumers to access funds held in their demand deposit accounts (DDAs). Debit cards allow consumers to transact without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. Visa provides the network infrastructure, product support and industry knowledge to help issuers optimize their debit offerings and help consumers and merchants efficiently transact for the purchase of goods and services, whether in person or through online or mobile channels. Across all Visas core products, Visa offers security protections that help prevent, detect and resolve fraud. Where applicable, Visa's zero-liability policy protects consumer cardholders from any unauthorized charges. Credit: Credit cards are issued by banks to allow consumers to access credit to pay for goods and services. Visa does not extend credit; however, we provide combinations of card benefits and brand support, that financial institutions use to support and enable their credit products. We also partner with our clients on product design, customer segmentation and customer experience design to help financial institutions better deliver products and services that match their consumers needs. In fiscal 2016, we saw significant volume growth from the conversion of the USAA portfolio to Visa and opening of credit acceptance at Costco membership warehouses in the U.S. Prepaid: Prepaid products draw funds from a designated pool of funds. Prepaid cards can be funded by individuals, corporations or governments. Prepaid cards address many consumer use cases and needs: 7 Commercial: We offer a portfolio of corporate (travel) cards and purchasing card (P-card) products covering all major segments. The Commercial category is not one single product but a portfolio of products designed to bring efficiency, controls and automation to corporate and government travel and procurement processes ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables. We support financial institutions, accounts payable platforms, like Bottomline and MineralTree, and technology companies as they build and expand their business-to-business platforms. Processing Infrastructure VisaNet authorizes, clears and settles transactions processed by Visa, excluding European domestic transactions, which are routed through the European processing platform. VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers that are linked by a global telecommunications network and engineered for minimal downtime and uninterrupted connectivity. While Visa Europe's systems are being integrated with our systems, we will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems from Visa Europe while ensuring interoperability with their processing centers in the United Kingdom (U.K.). VisaNet is capable of handling more than 65,000 transactions per second reliably, conveniently and securely. In fiscal 2016, Visa processed over 83 billion payment and cash disbursement authorization transactions, which included Europe during the fourth quarter. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to analyze each authorization we process in real time and provide value-added processing services, such as risk scoring and tokenization. It provides the infrastructure for delivering innovation and other payment system enhancements for domestic payment systems and cross border international transactions globally. A typical Visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her Visa product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction is then sent to the acquirer and routed over VisaNet or Visa Europe's processing platform to an issuer for an authorization decision. The transaction is either approved or declined and routed back to the acquirer and merchant usually in a matter of seconds. Transaction Processing Services Our core transaction processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. Our processing services also address the varied needs of other participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa DPS issuer processing. Merchant gateway services, provided through CyberSource, enable merchants to accept, process and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online and in-store. CyberSource additionally enables acquirers and other partners to offer these services to their merchants. DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM products. Value-added offerings by DPS to issuer clients include: fraud and risk services, data analytics, marketing campaign management, mobile and digital solutions, back office tools and services, card fulfillment and management, network gateway services, call centers and web hosting solutions. These and other services support our issuers and acquirers and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network by expanding the payment value chain and increasing network utilization. Digital Products Visa Checkout: Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online transactions wherever Visa Checkout is enabled. Visa Checkout helps merchants convert higher numbers of consumers to sale, a particularly important issue as digital commerce shifts from desktop devices to mobile devices which have lower conversion rates. At the end of fiscal 2016, Visa Checkout had over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries, seven languages and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers accept Visa Checkout. In October 2016, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience, making it easier for consumers to enroll and complete purchases on mobile devices. We recently announced that we are opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Visa Direct: Visa Direct is a push payment product platform that facilitates payer-initiated transactions that are sent directly to the Visa account of the recipient. It supports faster payments use cases like person-to-person (P2P) payments, and disbursements. We are working with key partners, including processors like Fiserv, FIS and Jack Henry  Associates, and originators like Early Warning (EWS), Ingo Money, Hyperwallet, Wells Fargo and QIWI, along with merchants to expand the distribution and usage of push payments. 8 We are also enabling push payments in developing economies to electronify payments. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in Kenya. First launched in Rwanda in 2014 and India in 2015, mVisa allows consumers to transfer money to merchants in real time using their mobile phones and merchants are able to accept Visa transactions without the need to install card acceptance hardware. Visa Token Service: The Visa Token Service replaces the card account numbers from the transaction with a token. Tokenization helps to protect consumer financial information and lessen the risk of stolen card credentials. In fiscal 2017, we announced new specifications that allow certified third party service providers such as Gemalto, Giesecke  Devrient and Inside Secure to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service Providers (TSP). These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services to support Visa tokens for issuers and token requestors participating in the Visa Token Service, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, we expect Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secure digital payment services across a wide range of solutions. Merchant Products Visa has a suite of products and services to help merchants reduce their payment fraud and improve their customer engagement. Visa Advertising Solutions, Visa Commerce Network and CyberSources product offerings are examples of Visas continued investment to deliver industry-leading products and capabilities to our merchant partners. Visa launched Visa Advertising Solutions, a service that allows merchants to better target and track the efficacy of their digital campaigns. Visa has partnered with strategic advertising technology leaders to help deliver targeting and measurement capabilities using aggregated and anonymous spend insights. The Visa Commerce Network (VCN) uses Visas global payment network to enable merchants to promote relevant offers to acquire new customers, drive loyalty and increase sales. For example, Uber uses the platform to provide its customers with card-linked offers from local restaurants and retailers. Qualifying purchases are recognized at the point of sale and rewards are applied to the riders' Uber accounts - eliminating the need for coupons. CyberSource offers a suite of products and services for merchants to manage online, mobile and in-store payments. CyberSource gateway services enable global payment acceptance of cards and other digital payment types. CyberSource Decision Manager is a comprehensive solution for fraud management including a merchant risk model, rules engine, managed services and solutions for specific categories such as airline fraud. Decision Manager Replay is an analytical tool that allows merchants to compare fraud strategies in real-time using their historical data to test and quantify the expected impact of various risk management strategies. CyberSource additionally offers payment security services including tokenization and payer authentication, commerce services such as tax calculation and recurring billing, and merchant reporting and analytics. CyberSource also offers products and services tailored to the needs of small and mid-sized merchants under the Authorize.Net brand. CyberSource and Authorize.Net capabilities are offered through Visa and our partners. Risk Products  Payment Security Initiatives Visa continues to develop our suite of risk products and services to help clients minimize risk and enable secure commerce. Visa Risk Manager is a decision making solution that helps issuers improve loss prevention and profitability through effective, enhanced risk evaluation capabilities. Products like Visa Advanced Authorization evaluate the risk associated with every participating VisaNet transaction. Our case studies have shown that an issuer employing Visa Advanced Authorization can significantly improve fraud detection. In addition to reducing fraud, approval rates can be increased by accepting transactions that were once deemed too risky. For example, in fiscal 2016 we introduced Mobile Location Confirmation, a service that enhances Visa Advanced Authorization by adding geolocation intelligence in real time. Mobile Location Confirmation informs issuers if their participating account holders mobile phone is near a purchase location. This new data improves the issuers ability to make more informed approve or decline decisions. We have also extended our fraud prediction capabilities to merchants via Visa Transaction Advisor. Our first implementation of this product is at fuel pumps, whereby we provide a risk indicator to the merchant for each Visa card transaction so the merchant can decide if they would like to require incremental authentication for risky transactions. Fuel merchants using our Visa Transaction Advisor product have seen a significant decline in counterfeit fraud rates and in lost and stolen fraud chargebacks. Verified by Visa is a solution designed to make online transactions safer by authenticating an account holders identity at the time of purchase. It is designed to improve account holder and merchant confidence in online 9 purchases and to reduce disputes and fraud related to the use of Visa payment products. Visa Consumer Authentication Service is a hosted solution for issuers on Verified by Visa transactions delivering protection against online fraud through risk-based authentication. Issuers have full control of when and how they decide to authenticate based on their transaction risk threshold, existing fraud-detection tools, operational requirements and user demands. We also launched Visa Consumer Transaction Controls in fiscal 2016, which allow account holders to place restrictions on their enrolled cards that define when, where and how those cards can be used to better manage account spending and security. Issuers can utilize this solution across their entire card portfolio. EMV Migration in the United States: To enhance payment security and mitigate counterfeit fraud, we have been working with U.S. merchants and financial institutions to encourage the adoption of EMV chip payment technology. EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, is a global standard for chip cards and chip terminals. Chip technology generates a one-time use code for every transaction that is used to authenticate that the transaction is originating from a valid (i.e., not fraudulent) card. Under policies announced by Visa in 2011, effective October 2015, the party that has not adopted the more secure chip technology is responsible for any resulting counterfeit fraud. Over the last year, there has been steady growth in chip card issuance and in the activation of chip-enabled terminals. As of September 30, 2016, more than 373 million Visa chip cards have been issued, making the United States the largest chip card market in the world. Nearly 1.6 million merchant locations in the United States are now chip-enabled, or roughly 30% of all U.S. merchants that accept Visa cards at the physical point of sale. Over 30% of U.S. in-store payment volume is now being processed as chip transactions. We continue to work to help improve the merchant and account holder experience, with the roll out of Quick Chip, a solution designed to reduce the time it takes to complete a chip transaction. We are also working with merchants and acquirers to simplify the terminal certification process, and have taken steps to limit merchants exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for those that have had challenges getting terminals certified and activated. SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS CEO Succession. On October 17, 2016, we announced that Alfred Kelly, Jr. will become CEO, effective December 1, 2016, replacing Charles Scharf. Mr. Scharf will serve as an advisor to Mr. Kelly for a period of several months to assist with the transition. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . Visa, MasterCard and various U.S. financial institutions are defendants in class and individual actions challenging, among other things, Visas and MasterCards purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees and certain network rules. In 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims. On January 14, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors appealed. On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court's certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement. The Second Circuit determined that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its decision. Prior to November 23, 2016, class plaintiffs may file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuits decision. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. See Item 1ARisk FactorsWe may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 20Legal Matters of this report for more information. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience and universality. Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our family of Visa marks, our PLUS mark and our Dove design mark, are important to our business. We give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers, which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. NET OPERATING REVENUES 10 Our gross revenues are principally comprised of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues. Net operating revenues are gross revenues reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. We have one reportable segment, Payment Services. Revenue Details COMPETITION The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with Visa for consumers, financial institution clients and merchant participation in our network and payment solutions. Technology and innovation is shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete, creating local networks or enabling processing competition. We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include: 11 Global or Multi-Regional Networks, which typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the U.S., or have a leading position in certain countries. For example, UnionPay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China. Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2015 (1) : ##TABLE_START (1)  UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. Visa Europe data are included. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1085 (April 2016). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products. ##TABLE_END Local and regional networks, that operate  in many countries, often with the support of government influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial intuitions. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, have functionality or their brand marks present with the Visa brand on the card or payment device, and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the United States, Interac in Canada, and EFTPOS in Australia. Alternate Payment Providers, which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the Automated Clearing House (ACH), or global or local networks like Visa. In some cases, these entities are both a partner and a competitor to Visa. Examples include PayPal and Alipay. Other Electronic Payment Networks like  the ACH in the U.S. are often created and governed by local governments. Historically focused on interbank transfers, many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments. We also compete with closed-loop payment systems, wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers. Payment Processors, where we face competition for the processing of Visa transactions or are not permitted to do so under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), we may face competition from other networks, processors and other third-parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance, security, convenience and universality offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate. We do so by partnering with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental 12 organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. SEASONALITY We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. WORKING CAPITAL Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business included elsewhere in this report. GOVERNMENT REGULATION As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks. Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry. Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies. The federal banking agencies comprising the FFIEC are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. Visa also may be examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Hong Kong and Europe (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa for purposes of various degrees of financial stability regulation as a retail payment system. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Government-imposed Market Participation and Restrictions. Certain governments, including China, Russia and India, have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic processing be done entirely in that country. Interchange Rates and Fees. An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions, the E.U.s Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) limits interchange rates in Europe (as discussed below) and the Reserve Bank of Australia has regulated average permissible levels of interchange for over a decade. Network Exclusivity and Routing. In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFRs prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card. No-surcharge Rules. We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation. Privacy and Data Protection. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services, and even 13 impact our ability to offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity practices. In many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach, and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost. The European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, which will become effective in May 2018, will create new individual privacy rights and impose worldwide obligations on companies handling personal data. Anti-corruption, Anti-money Laundering, Anti-terrorism and Sanctions. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws, that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Internet Transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol. Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us. European Regulations and Supervisory Oversight. In addition, following the Visa Europe acquisition in June 2016, we are subject to complex and evolving regulation of our business in the European Union. Visa Europe has been designated as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of Englands oversight to ensure the financial stability of the U.K. Visa Europe is also subject to the Eurosystems oversight, including the security of payment instruments and ecommerce security policies and scheme rules. Furthermore, Visa Europe is regulated by the U.K.s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the U.K., and ensuring payments meet account holder needs. It also is the regulator responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in the U.K. Outside the U.K., in relation to IFR, Visa is also subject to compliance monitoring by national competent authorities in all markets. The IFR regulates interchange rates within Europe, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting, organization and decision making purposes within the E.U. and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. There are other regulations in the E.U. that impact our business, as discussed above, including, privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other recent regulatory changes in Europe such as the PSD2 could reduce perceived barriers to entry for emerging, non-card payments.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks 14 Increased regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, operating rules and related practices, could harm our business . Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction (those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues. Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example, in 2011, in accordance with the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. This amounted to a significant reduction in the average system-wide interchange reimbursement fees received by large issuers. The Dodd-Frank Act also limited issuers' and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacted our business. In 2015, the E.U.s IFR placed an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross border transactions (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively), significantly reducing the fees received by E.U. issuers. E.U. Member States have the ability to further restrict these interchange levels within their territories. More recently, in September 2016, Argentina's Senate approved a bill to reduce existing caps on the merchant discount rate charged by acquirers to 1.5% for credit transactions and zero for debit transactions. In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. For example, government regulations or pressure may require or allow other networks to be supported by Visa products or services or to have the other network's functionality or brand marks on our products. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. In addition, the E.U.s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and could impact the efficient integration of Visa Europe; the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies; our ability to provide effective customer service; and the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk systems and loyalty services. We are also subject to central bank oversight in the U.K. and the E.U. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally. Increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for financial institution participation in, and access to our payments system. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles. Regulators around the world increasingly take note of each others approaches to regulating the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. The U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the E.U. IFR are developments with such potential, as are approaches taken by regulators in Australia, Canada and other countries. See Note 20Legal Matters of this report. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to the same regulation as debit payments. Additionally, regulation in an individual country could continue and expand. For example, in Australia the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees to consumers, making our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate 15 payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues. For these reasons, increased global regulation of the payments industry may make our products less desirable, diminish our ability to compete, reduce our transaction volumes and harm our business. Government-imposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries . Governments in various jurisdictions, such as in Asia and the Gulf Cooperation Countries in the Middle East, protect certain domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country, which would prevent us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions. In China, for example, UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over other international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the full implementation guidelines for BCCIs have yet to be finalized. In Russia, legislation has effectively prevented us from processing in the domestic market and mandated that we migrate our domestic processing business to the state-owned NSPK (or national payment card system), which is the only entity allowed to process domestically. Due to our inability to oversee the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards carrying our brands in these countries, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third party processors in these regions to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively. National laws that protect domestic processing may increase our costs, decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed, impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and control the quality of the services supporting our brands, restrict our activities, force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets, all of which could harm our ability to operate our business, maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands. We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results . As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. See Item 1  Business  Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us (and on our clients and other third parties) could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules or require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules, and it may increase our compliance costs and reduce our revenue opportunities. We may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa Rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Further, as regulations change, they may affect our existing contractual arrangements. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process and our revenue; negatively impact our brands and our competitive positioning; and limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which our products are used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business. We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws . 16 We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.K.s HM Revenue  Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform or those resulting from the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Litigation Risks We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place . We are involved in numerous civil actions and government investigations alleging violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law and intellectual property law, among others. Details of the claims and the status of those proceedings are described more fully in Note 20Legal Matters . Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material litigation, proceedings or investigations, particularly in a large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. In addition, settlement terms, judgments or pressures resulting from legal proceedings or investigations may require us, to modify the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, revise the Visa Rules or the way in which we enforce our rules, modify our fees or pricing, or modify the way we do business, which may harm our business. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation asserted against them, even if Visa is not a defendant. For certain litigation matters like the U.S. covered litigation and the VE territory covered litigation, which are described in Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters , we have certain protections provided for in the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are able to either fund the settlements and judgments in the case of the U.S. covered litigation or recoup covered losses in the case of the VE territory covered litigation. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. Business Risks We face intense competition in our industry . The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves, new competitors emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other closed-loop payments systems, and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, emerging payment providers and other digital and technology companies. Many of these providers have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels, and are seeking to expand into other channels that compete with or replace our products and services. Additionally, some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology, more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources. They may offer a wider range of programs, products and services, including some that are more innovative. They may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours, achieving broader brand recognition, and greater issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate in different market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to 17 regulatory, technological and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Federal Reserves Faster Payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and in the U.K. through the PSR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies, including mobile payments, alternate payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others are developing alternative payment networks or products that could disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives like The Clearing House, an ACH-based payment system comprised of large financial institutions, and EWS, an alternative to an ACH payment system that provides faster funds or real-time payments across P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting ACH-based real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or utilize our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others may develop methods to use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to compete with, impair or replace digital payment products that use and support our network and processing over our network; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may need to adjust our local rules and practices to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscapes and competitors practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties, thereby increasing operational costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may need to agree to business arrangements with terms less protective of Visas proprietary technology and interests in order to compete with others, including those with issuers and with competing networks; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH payments or direct debit of consumer checking accounts; ##TABLE_END 18 ##TABLE_START  new players and intermediaries in the payments value chain may redirect transactions or steer participants away from our network; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may face increasing risk of others asserting their intellectual property rights and potential litigation, as market entrants include technology companies and companies from industries where patent rights are actively asserted; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  as this landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new business, products, services and practices; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new or revised industry standards related to EMV-chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain and maintain . Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts and rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options. Market pressures on providing incentives, fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits. In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business. Merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa products. Certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory enforcement, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products. In the U.S., the cost of payment card acceptance has emerged in the context of payment security. A number of merchant trade associations claim that EMV cards without PIN cardholder verification are not worth the investment. The October 2015 liability shift and ongoing transition to EMV resulted in calls for a PIN verification mandate. More recently, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process. Some 19 policymakers have called upon U.S. competition authorities to consider potential concerns arising from the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. Additionally, some merchants and processors have pushed for changes to industry practices and our requirements for Visa acceptance at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transaction, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business. We depend on relationships with our financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants and other third parties . We depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with customers and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. Our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. For example, in the U.S., the EMV migration has been resisted by certain merchants, leading to conflicts and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift, chargebacks and debit routing, among others. We engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with merchants, who receive incentives from us. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to continue to engage in these discussions in order to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on third parties, including suppliers, and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network, on our behalf. To the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be harmed. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, if events occur that damage our reputation or brands or we experience brand disintermediation, it could harm our business . Our brands are globally recognized and are key assets of our business. We believe that our clients and customers associate our brands with acceptance, security, convenience and universality. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brands and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The increased use or popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution companies could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand. In addition, our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data security breaches, compliance failures, negative perception of our industry or the industries of our clients, actions by clients or other third parties, such as sponsorship partners, that do not reflect our views or are inconsistent with our own business practices, and fraudulent or other illegal activity using our payment products. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, or if events occur that damage our reputation, the value of our brands may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, customers and the public, as well as impact our business. Global economic, political, market and social events or conditions may harm our business . Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by customers, governments and businesses, whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. In addition, almost half of our operating revenues are earned outside the U.S. International transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Therefore, adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or slowdown of global trade, could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government and corporate spending, which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or other local or global health issues like the Zika virus, political uncertainties like Brexit, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, and natural disasters could impact our operations, our clients and our activities in a particular location. These events could also reduce cross-border travel and spend, which impacts our international transaction revenues, which are generated by processing cross-border payments and cash volume transactions, as well as from foreign currency exchange transactions. Any 20 such decline in cross-border activity could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our foreign currency exchange activities, and in turn reduce our revenues. A decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions to reduce the number of cards, accounts and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced, value-added services from us. Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue. Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources, which could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. The United Kingdoms proposed withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results . In June 2016, a referendum was held in the United Kingdom to determine whether the country should remain a member of the E.U., with voters approving withdrawal from the E.U. (commonly referred to as Brexit). The U.K. government is working towards triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will commence the official E.U. withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the terms of the U.K.s departure from the E.U. could harm our business and financial results. In addition, other E.U. member countries may consider referendums regarding their E.U. membership. Any of these events, along with any political changes that may occur as a result of Brexit, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe. As a result, our operations in the U.K., resulting from the recent acquisition of Visa Europe, as well as our global operations, could be impacted. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may harm our results of operations as the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our clients, who may curtail or postpone investments in growing their credit portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that harm our volume and revenue. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the U.K. and E.U. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the U.K., may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the E.U. and as a result, our Visa Rules and contractual commitments in the U.K. may be impacted. In addition, because we conduct business in and have operations in the U.K., we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate E.U. Member States. These factors may impact our ability to operate in the E.U. and U.K. seamlessly. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could harm our business and financial results. Technology and Information Security Risks Failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact our future growth . 21 The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, crypto-currency, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted. It is also difficult to predict how these technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of these new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or assertions, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. If we or our partners fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, and harm our business and impact our future growth. A failure in or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business . Our information security and processing systems, as well as those of our clients, merchants and other third-party service providers, may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, worms or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. Additionally, several merchants have encountered substantial cybersecurity breaches and re-breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Although these merchant breaches have not had a direct, material impact on us, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we may be unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business. We may also be impacted by breaches of our financial institution clients and third-party processors that affect the broader payment system. In addition, numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, particularly on our internet-facing and reliant applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. The security measures and procedures we, our clients, merchants and other service providers have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. Although we devote significant resources to our information security program and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these known or unknown threats. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach, cyber-attack or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, a breach may also subject Visa to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions. We may experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems, which could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and customers; damage our reputation; result in litigation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and regulatory fines or penalties; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our current business continuity program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise. Structural and Organizational Risks Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems during the integration phase of our acquisition could damage the business and global perception of our brands . 22 While Visa Europe's systems are being integrated with our legacy systems, we and Visa Europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where it originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business in the event of increasing costs or difficulties in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems during the integration phase. The separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and our legacy operations could negatively affect the experience of customers using Visa products globally. Failure to authorize, clear and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Visa Europe acquisition or those of our other strategic investments or acquisitions, and may face other risks and uncertainties as a result . In June 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. We believe the acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europes transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise, although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefits. In addition, we may make other strategic investments or acquisitions, which like the Visa Europe acquisition are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside our control. The Visa Europe acquisition involves, and any future strategic endeavors may involve, significant risks and uncertainties, which could include: ##TABLE_START  disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and managements attention from our existing business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to develop the acquired business adequately; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  difficulty implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to retain employees, clients or partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions such as the acquisition of Visa Europe, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with operating in new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1  Business  Government Regulations and Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks above; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  discovery of unidentified issues after the acquisition or investment was made; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to mitigate the liabilities of the acquired business; for example, while we have attempted to mitigate the risk of loss associated with certain Visa Europe litigation through the issuance of the preferred stock, there can be no guarantee that the liabilities associated with that litigation will not exceed the value of such preferred stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential incurrence of debt, including the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  anticipated benefits or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing. ##TABLE_END We may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management . 23 The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series B and series C preferred stock into shares of class A common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. In connection with the acquisition of Visa Europe, we issued series B and series C preferred stock, which will become convertible into class A common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). Conversion of our class B and class C common stock into class A common stock, or our series B and series C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class A common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class A common stockholders. Holders of our class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series B and series C preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. With respect to our series B and series C preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series B and series C preferred stock would either (i) receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common stockholders. Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt or change in control difficult . Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, except for limited exceptions: ##TABLE_START  no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders meeting and may not act by written consent; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  only the board of directors, Chairman or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders. ##TABLE_END24 ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Price Range of Common Stock Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol V since March 19, 2008. At November 9, 2016 , we had 362 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our class A common stock is held in \"street name\" by banks and brokers.

Dividend Declaration and Policy During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , we paid the following quarterly cash dividends per share of our class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, on an as-converted basis) to all holders of record of our common and preferred stock on the respective record dates. ##TABLE_START Fiscal 2016 Dividend Per Share First Quarter $ 0.14 Second Quarter $ 0.14 Third Quarter $ 0.14 Fourth Quarter $ 0.14   Fiscal 2015 Dividend Per Share First Quarter $ 0.12 Second Quarter $ 0.12 Third Quarter $ 0.12 Fourth Quarter $ 0.12 ##TABLE_ENDAdditionally, in October 2016 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.165 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and U.K.I and Europe preferred 26 stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 6, 2016 , to holders of record as of November 18, 2016 of our common and preferred stock. Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common and preferred stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling $ 528 million  were made from fiscal 2014 through 2016 from the U.S. litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $978 million related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2016.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, \"us,\" our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We enable global commerce through the transfer of value and information among these participants. Our advanced transaction processing network facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2016 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth. Visa Europe acquisition. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. The purchase price consisted of: (a) at the closing of the transaction (Closing), up-front cash consideration of 12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, equivalent to a value of 5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016, and (b) following the third anniversary of the Closing, an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory before the Closing. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom before the Closing. Our consolidated balance sheets reflect the consolidation of Visa Europe as of September 30, 2016. We did not include Visa Europe's financial results in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Our consolidated statements of operations include the financial results of Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe , Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  and Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Debt issuance. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on these notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14, commencing June 14, 2016. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion , after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were used to fund the upfront cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Visa Europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments  and Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Financial highlights.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. ##TABLE_END We recorded net operating revenues of $15.1 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of Visa Europe . The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our total operating growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were $7.2 billion , compared to $4.8 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction, combined with acquisition-related costs of approximately $152 million. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. Our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities related to prior fiscal years. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Severance cost.  In the fiscal fourth quarter, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Remeasurement of deferred tax liability.  In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of U.K. stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable ##TABLE_END31 federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START  Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss . Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits of $167 million associated with the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision.  Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END32 Adjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating income, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2016 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating Income (Expense)  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) As reported $ 7,199  %  $  $ 2,021  $ 5,991  $ 2.48 Severance cost (110 )  %      0.03 Remeasurement of deferred tax liability    %     (88 )  (0.04 ) Acquisition-related costs (152 )  %      0.04 Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss (1,877 )  %     1,184  0.49 Net gains on currency forward contracts    %  (74 )  (27 )  (47 )  (0.02 ) Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits    %  (145 )  (54 )  (91 )  (0.04 ) Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %  (255 )    (255 )  (0.11 ) As adjusted $ 5,060  %  $ (345 )  $ 2,815  $ 6,862  $ 2.84 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported           2,414 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating Income (Expense)  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 4,816  %  $ (69 )  $ 2,667  $ 6,328  $ 2.58 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %      0.04 As adjusted $ 4,816  %  $  $ 2,667  $ 6,438  $ 2.62 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported           2,457 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2014 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating Income (Expense)  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 5,005  %  $  $ 2,286  $ 5,438  $ 2.16 Litigation provision (450 )  %      0.11 As adjusted $ 4,555  %  $  $ 2,453  $ 5,721  $ 2.27 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported           2,523 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased 91 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016 , we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2015 have been completed. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. 33 Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the U.S., driven mainly by consumer debit and credit. Nominal international payments volume was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 (1) and 2015 was 37% and 13%, respectively. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. The following tables present nominal payments volume.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 reflect the related nominal payments volume of Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The following table provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, including transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa's networks during the fiscal periods presented.

See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As a result of changes in Russian National Payment System law, we transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian National Payment Card System during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after the transition. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe during the fiscal fourth quarter. ##TABLE_ENDResults of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. 35 Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition, product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating Income (Expense) Non-operating income (expense)  primarily includes interest expense, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations. 36 Visa Inc. Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the U.S., internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe revenue earned for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is included in International. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)  2016 (2)    vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 7,851  $ 7,406  $ 6,847  $  $  %  % International 7,040  6,219  5,629    %  % Revenues earned under the Framework Agreement (3)    (64 )   (25 )%  % Net operating revenues $ 15,082  $ 13,880  $ 12,702  $ 1,202  $ 1,178  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of Visa Europe . These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2016, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth. The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Other revenues also includes revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)  2016 (2)    vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 6,747  $ 6,302  $ 5,797  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 6,272  5,552  5,167    %  % International transaction revenues 4,649  4,064  3,560    %  % Other revenues        %  % Client incentives (3,409 )  (2,861 )  (2,592 )  (548 )  (269 )  %  % Net operating revenues $ 15,082  $ 13,880  $ 12,702  $ 1,202  $ 1,178  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The growth in fiscal 2016 service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 17% and 9% , respectively, which includes data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 37%, including revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter. In addition to the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our international transaction revenue yield, fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and Visa Europe's incentives for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_ENDOperating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)  2016 (2)    vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 2,226  $ 2,079  $ 1,875  $  $  %  % Marketing    (3 )  (28 )   %  (3 )% Network and processing     (33 )  %  (7 )% Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative      %  % Litigation provision    (12 )  (439 )  (86 )%  (97 )% Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss 1,877      1,877    NM   % Total operating expenses (3) $ 7,199  $ 4,816  $ 5,005  $ 2,383  $ (189 )  %  (4 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Operating expenses incurred by Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are reflected in fiscal 2016 total operating expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2014 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the Visa Europe acquisition, or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Overview within this Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe, combined with an increase from the inclusion of Visa Europe fiscal fourth quarter expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor ##TABLE_END38 costs, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, combined with higher incentive compensation. ##TABLE_START  Marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 reflect efficiencies in production and agency costs which were redeployed for other marketing uses, and Visa Europe expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter. The decrease in marketing during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend that was incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases in promotional campaigns that support our growth strategies and product initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing  expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian National Payment Card system during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2015 was a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2016 were flat compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2016 mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe and the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. The increase was also attributable to net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact. The increase in fiscal 2015 was mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the absence of a loss incurred in fiscal 2015 upon the settlement of uncovered litigation. The decrease in fiscal 2015 reflects the absence of a $450 million  accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation incurred in fiscal 2014. See Note 20Legal Matters  and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss resulted from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_ENDNon-operating Income (Expense)  The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense) . ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)  2016 (2)    vs.  vs.  vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (427 )  $ (3 )  $ (8 )  $ (424 )  $  NM  (61 )% Other  (66 )    (101 )  NM  NM Total non-operating income (expense) $  $ (69 )  $  $  $ (96 )  NM  NM ##TABLE_END39 ##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Our non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2016 does not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Fiscal 2016 non-operating income (expense) includes financial results of Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $16.0 billion fixed-rate senior notes in December 2015. See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income (expense) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As these contracts are not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses are recorded directly in earnings as part of non-operating income (expense) ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. ##TABLE_END See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments  and Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 . The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END Adjusted effective income tax rate . Our financial results for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2016. See Overview - Adjusted financial results within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. 40 ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2016  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate (1)   As reported $ 8,012  $ 2,021  25.2 % Severance cost    Remeasurement of deferred tax liability     Acquisition-related costs    Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss 1,877    Net gains on currency forward contracts (74 )  (27 )   Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits (145 )  (54 )   Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (255 )     As adjusted $ 9,677  $ 2,815  29.1 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 5,574  $ 6,584  $ 7,205 Investing activities (10,916 )  (1,435 )  (941 ) Financing activities 7,477  (3,603 )  (6,478 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34 )   (1 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,101  $ 1,547  $ (215 ) ##TABLE_END41 Operating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the Visa Europe acquisition and the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation, including: ##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe, and payment of $244 million of interest on the senior notes during fiscal 2016 (see Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  and Note 9Debt ); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid. ##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction. Cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  and Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market, and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, as follows: ##TABLE_START  payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2015; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.1 billion in takedown payments returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $450 million deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014. ##TABLE_END The remainder of the change in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , Note 9Debt , Note 14Stockholders' Equity and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $8.7 billion at September 30, 2016 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the U.S. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $8.3 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these funds been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.9 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. 42 Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2016 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit facility. On January 27, 2016 , we entered into an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 27, 2021 , replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which expired on January 27, 2016 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2016 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018. Long-term debt and change in capital structure . In conjunction with the Visa Europe acquisition, we have evolved our long-term capital structure. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Our first principal payment of $1.8 billion is due on December 14, 2017. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year. An interest payment of $244 million was made on June 14, 2016. The Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at our option at any time prior to maturity, at a specified redemption price. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of $127 million, were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Visa Europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to issue additional debt of about $2.0 billion by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, market conditions permitting. U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2016 , was $1.0 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2016 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 43 Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2016 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $242 million. Visa Europe acquisition. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. We paid up-front cash consideration of 12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock, equivalent to a value of 5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016. Also, in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2016 , we made $45 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. At September 30, 2016 , the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.0 billion . In June 2016, the approval of the 2012 Settlement Agreement was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we will have the right to approximately $3.0 billion, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  and  Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased 91 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016 , we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion . In October 2015 and July 2016, our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for $5.0 billion each. These authorizations have no expiration date. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2015 have been completed. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2016 , we declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends. In October 2016 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.165 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock and U.K.I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $400 million in connection with this dividend on December 6, 2016 . See Note 14Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the U.K. pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe U.K. pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the U.K. pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million , $19 million , and 44 $14 million , respectively. For Visa Europe's U.K. pension plans, we made contributions of $102 million subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2017 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. and Visa Europe's U.K. defined benefit pension plans by approximately $12 million and $6 million , respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2016 , due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2016 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $12.0 billion of assets and $136 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2016. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 45 ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $  $ 2,696  $ 3,903  $ 16,501  $ 23,589 Purchase orders (2)      1,175 Leases (3)     Client incentives (4) 5,544  6,745  4,721  4,791  21,801 Marketing and sponsorship (5)     Dividends (6)        Deferred purchase consideration (7)   1,266      1,266 Total (8,9) $ 7,647  $ 11,304  $ 8,939  $ 21,515  $ 49,405 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  In December 2015, we issued $16.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in conjunction with the acquisition of Visa Europe with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year. Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 9Debt  to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to nineteen years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Includes expected dividend amount of $400 million as dividends were declared in October 2016 and will be paid on December 6, 2016 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 18, 2016 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $911 million . At September 30, 2016, we had also accrued $61 million of interest and $17 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END46 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2016 , client incentives represented 18% of gross operating revenues. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2016. Our Europe 47 retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2016 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $160 million or loss of approximately $190 million , respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the Closing, we will pay additional purchase consideration of  1 billion , plus 4.0% compound annual interest. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $123 million , including interest. 48 We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016, could result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.9 billion . In the third quarter, we designated our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of our net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company's net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $5.1 billion and $4.4 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $49 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2016 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $254 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $40 million in pension cost. At September 30, 2016 , our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $415 million and projected benefit obligations were $474 million . A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $127 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $9 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2017 , if any, which would be made in September 2017. 49 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Visa Inc. acquired Visa Europe during 2016, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, Visa Europe's internal control over financial reporting associated with 7% of total assets and 4% of net operating revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Europe. /s/ KPMG LLP Santa Clara, California November 15, 2016  51 VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2016 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada) and Inovant LLC (Inovant) became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (the October 2007 reorganization or reorganization). See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe) did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company's consolidated statements of operations do not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe for the 10 days from the acquisition date through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's largest retail electronic payments network  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes 62 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities included auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option at September 30, 2015. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments 63 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-U.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients.These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding cash collateral held by Visa Europe as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 64 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2016 . See Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2016 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2016 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2016 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2016 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see  Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe ) prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17Commitments and Contingencies . Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 12 years for the Visa Europe U.K. pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016, derivatives outstanding mature within 18 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting in changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company's euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe . Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying promised goods or services and on determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, which rescinds certain SEC staff observer comments upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, including the SEC comments related to consideration given by a vendor to a customer. In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-12, which provides narrow scope improvements and technical expedients on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, evaluating contract modifications and completed contracts at the time of transition and the disclosure requirement for the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and all of its related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. Subsequently, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, which adds SEC staff guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, allowing for the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company elected to early adopt the standards effective October 1, 2015 and the carrying amount of the Company's debt liability is presented net of issuance costs on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 9Debt . In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which provides guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment will help entities evaluate whether such an arrangement includes a software license, which should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, which simplifies the accounting for post-acquisition adjustments by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for the adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance on a 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 prospective basis effective October 1, 2015. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as non-current. The standard impacts presentation only. The Company elected to early adopt the standard on a retrospective basis effective October 1, 2015 and all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Previously, current deferred tax assets had been presented separately and current deferred tax liabilities had been included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts within the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The reclassification did not affect the Company's total equity, operating revenues, net income, comprehensive income or cash flows as of and for the periods presented. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and does not anticipate that this new accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the value of leased assets and liabilities that may be recognized could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call/put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment is required to assess the embedded call/put options solely in accordance with a four-step decision sequence. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The equity method investor is required to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees' maximum statutory tax rates, allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur, and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. The Company will early adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. The amendment requires a financial asset 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendment in this update also requires that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in the statement of income. The Company is evaluating the full effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2020. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-16 will have on its consolidated financial statements and is considering early adoption of the standard. Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions Visa to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. At the closing of the transaction (the \"Closing\"), the Company:  paid up-front cash consideration of  12.2 billion ( $13.9 billion ); ##TABLE_START  issued preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock of the Company, as described below, equivalent to a value of  5.3 billion ( $6.1 billion ) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  agreed to pay an additional  1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. ##TABLE_END Preferred stock . In connection with the transaction, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created: ##TABLE_START  series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Companys class A common stock (the class A equivalent preferred stock); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the U.K.I preferred stock); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Europe preferred stock). ##TABLE_END The Company issued 2,480,466 shares of U.K.I preferred stock to Visa Europes member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing, and 3,156,823 shares of Europe preferred stock to Visa Europes other member financial institutions entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing. Under certain conditions described below, the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock is convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K.I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the \"VE territory covered litigation\"), where, generally, the relevant claims (and resultant liabilities and losses) relate to the period before the Closing. Only seventy percent of such liabilities may be offset where the liability arises from a claim related to inter-regional multilateral interchange fees applied to transactions where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory while the merchant outlet is located within the Visa Europe territory. A reduction in the conversion rates of the U.K.I preferred stock and the Europe preferred stock have the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock because it reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. Additionally, the shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock are subject to 70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the Closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the U.K.I or Europe preferred stock (whether by such 12th anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the holder would receive either class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The class A equivalent preferred stock will be freely transferable and each share of class A equivalent preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The holders of the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock. With respect to those limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the holders of the preferred stock requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. Upon issuance, all three series of preferred stock will participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. U.K. loss sharing agreement . On November 2, 2015, the Company, Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the U.K. LSA members) entered into a loss sharing agreement (the U.K. loss sharing agreement). Each of the U.K. LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the Closing (the \"U.K. covered claims\"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each U.K. LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such U.K. LSA member. The U.K. LSA members obligations under the U.K. loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent at the Closing of  1.0 billion having arisen in U.K covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the U.K.I preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the U.K.I preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Litigation management deed . On June 21, 2016, the Company and Visa Europe entered into a litigation management deed (the \"litigation management deed\"), which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from the VE territory covered litigation (\"VE territory covered losses\") between the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the newly established litigation management committees for VE territory covered litigation (\"VE territory litigation management committees\"). The VE territory litigation management committees, which are composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, have also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory covered litigation. Framework Agreement. In connection with the Company's October 2007 reorganization, the Company granted to Visa Europe exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the Company and certain affiliates within the Visa Europe region for use in the field of financial services, payments, related information technology and information processing services and participation in the Visa system (the \"Framework Agreement\"). We recorded $191 million , $255 million and $226 million of revenue in accordance with the Framework Agreement during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the acquisition, the fee recognized in fiscal year 2016 was pro-rated for the period prior to the Closing, and no fees related to the Framework Agreement were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016, nor will they be recognized in future periods. 71 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Acquisition-related costs. The Company incurred $152 million of non-recurring operating expense during fiscal 2016 . This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of expense related to U.K. stamp duty, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses. Accounting treatment for the acquisition. The following table details the purchase consideration: ##TABLE_START  Accounting Purchase Consideration  (in millions) Cash payment $ 13,882 Fair value of preferred stock (1) 5,692 Total upfront consideration $ 19,574 Fair value of deferred cash consideration (2) 1,236 Total consideration before adjustments $ 20,810 Less: Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss (3) (1,856 ) Less: Treasury stock (4) (170 ) Total accounting purchase consideration $ 18,784 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The fair value of preferred stock was determined based on its as-converted value of $6.1 billion on June 21, 2016, less a 6% discount for illiquidity as these shares are subject to limitations on transferability. The fair value was also adjusted to reflect $25 million of \"right to recover for covered losses\" related to VE territory covered losses prior to the Closing. See Note 20Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  This amount reflects the fair value of deferred cash consideration of  1.0 billion , plus 4.0% compound annual interest, payable on the third anniversary of the Closing, discounted at a rate of 1.2% . At September 30, 2016, the deferred consideration of $1.2 billion reflects interest accretion recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, more than offset by the impact of changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate from the Closing. ##TABLE_END Total consideration has been adjusted to account for the following items to arrive at the accounting purchase consideration: ##TABLE_START (3)  the loss upon consummation of the transaction resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement provided Visa Europe with a perpetual, exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the Visa Europe region in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since inception in 2007, while the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. Using an income approach, the Company assessed the contractual terms and conditions of the Framework Agreement as compared to current market conditions and the historical and expected financial performance of Visa Europe. Based on the analysis performed, the Company determined that the terms were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the Closing. The present value of the expected differential between payments required by the Framework Agreement and those that would be required if the contract were at fair value under U.S. GAAP was calculated over the Framework Agreement's contractual perpetual term, resulting in a loss of $1.9 billion recognized within operating expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and a reduction to the purchase accounting consideration; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  the fair value of the Visa class C common stock held by Visa Europe as of the Closing. ##TABLE_END Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation as we continue to gather additional information necessary to finalize the valuation. These preliminary values may further change in future reporting periods until finalization of the valuation, which will occur no later than the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation. ##TABLE_START  Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation  (in millions) Current assets (1) $ 4,457 Non-current assets (2) Current liabilities (3) (2,731 ) Non-current liabilities (2) (2,605 ) Tangible assets and liabilities $ (621 ) Intangible assets  customer relationships and reacquired rights (2) 16,137 Goodwill (4) 3,268 Fair value of net assets acquired $ 18,784 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Current assets are largely comprised of cash and cash equivalents and settlement receivable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and reacquired rights, which have been valued as a single composite intangible asset as they are inextricably linked. These intangibles are considered indefinite-lived assets as the associated customer relationships have historically not experienced significant attrition, and the reacquired rights are based on the Framework Agreement, which has a perpetual term. Non-current assets and liabilities include deferred tax assets and liabilities that result in net deferred tax liabilities of $2.4 billion , which are primarily related to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, and are not expected to be realized in the foreseeable future. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Current liabilities assumed mainly include settlement payable, client incentives liabilities and accrued liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  The excess of purchase consideration over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value that is expected from increased scale and synergies as a result of the integration of both businesses. ##TABLE_END Actual and pro forma impact of acquisition. The Company did not include Visa Europe's financial results in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Total consolidated Visa Inc. net revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 includes $554 million from Visa Europe's operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Had the Company not acquired Visa Europe, approximately $65 million of revenue would have been recorded under the Framework Agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Therefore, the acquisition of Visa Europe resulted in a net increase of $489 million in net revenue. 73 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Total consolidated Visa Inc. net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 includes $299 million from Visa Europe's operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This includes the non-cash, non-recurring $88 million tax benefit upon remeasurement of a deferred tax liability to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. In connection with the acquisition, Visa Inc. recorded several significant items that would not have been incurred had we not acquired Visa Europe. Therefore, the acquisition of Visa Europe reduced Visa Inc. fiscal year 2016 consolidated net income by approximately $872 million , as follows: ##TABLE_START   Impact of Visa Europe acquisition on fiscal 2016 consolidated net income: (in millions) Visa Europe net income included in consolidated net income $ Less approximately $65 million of revenue that would have been recorded by Visa Inc. under the Framework Agreement, net of tax (41 ) Less acquisition-related expense recorded by Visa Inc., net of tax, upon:  Effective settlement of the Framework Agreement (1,184 ) Interest expense incurred on $16.0 billion debt, net of interest income earned (243 ) Transaction costs incurred (96 ) Add acquisition-related gains recorded by Visa Inc., net of tax, upon:  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option Remeasurement of euro deposits Remeasurement of currency forward contracts Total impact of Visa Europe acquisition on consolidated net income $ (872 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents supplemental pro forma information as if the acquisition and related issuance of senior notes had occurred on October 1, 2014. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the Company's consolidated results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisition been completed on October 1, 2014, nor does it purport to project the future results of operations of the combined company or reflect any reorganizations, or cost or other operating synergies that may occur subsequent to the Closing. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma results presented here due to many factors. ##TABLE_START  Pro Forma Consolidated Results  Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015  (in millions, except per share data) Total operating revenues $ 16,090  $ 15,425 Net income $ 7,072  $ 5,210 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.93  $ 2.06 ##TABLE_ENDThe pro forma financial information above reflects the following material pro forma adjustments: ##TABLE_START  conversion of Visa Europe's historical results of operations from euro to U.S. dollar, and from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. GAAP; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  elimination of transactions between Visa and Visa Europe upon consolidation, primarily related to annual license and various other fees paid by Visa Europe to Visa in accordance with the Framework Agreement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an increase in non-operating expense for additional interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the issuance of the $16.0 billion senior notes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  exclusion of a $255 million gain in the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and $110 million loss in the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 related to the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option (1) ; and ##TABLE_END74 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 ##TABLE_START  the inclusion of non-recurring amounts on October 1, 2014, the date the acquisition is presumed to have occurred for purposes of presenting pro forma results, and a corresponding reduction of these amounts in the period originally recognized, as follows: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement recognized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $152 million of acquisition-related costs for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $145 million of foreign exchange gains related to euros held during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $74 million of gains for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  For purposes of preparing this pro forma financial information, the fair value of the Visa Europe put option is presumed to have been reduced to zero prior to October 1, 2014. Therefore, gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option liability are not included in pro forma net income for either period presented. ##TABLE_END The pro forma results also reflect the applicable tax impact of the pro forma adjustments. The taxes associated with the adjustments reflect the statutory tax rate in effect during the respective periods. Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the U.S. covered litigation.\" These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan and consist of a U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Company's shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended. U.S. covered litigation consists of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START  the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company's IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any case brought after October 22, 2015, by a merchant that opted out of the Rule 23(b)(3) settlement class pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. See Note 20Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END U.S. Litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.

In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2016. See Note 20Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict 76 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations is not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class Settlement Agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the Settlement Agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, the U.K. loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the \"Europe retrospective responsibility plan.\" See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 20Legal Matters . The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to seventy percent of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, while the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the Company against all types of litigation in Europe, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock. The total amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The book value of the preferred stock reflects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing. Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a reduction to stockholders' equity and operating expenses, which represents the Company's right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as \"right to recover for covered losses.\" 77 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than  20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in \"right to recover for covered losses\" as contra-equity will then be recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had recorded $34 million in the \"right to recover for covered losses\" related to VE territory covered losses, of which $25 million was incurred prior to the Closing. There were no adjustments to the conversion rate in fiscal 2016. The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred shares recorded in stockholders' equity within the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 (1) : ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2016  As-Converted Value of Preferred Stock (2)  Book Value of Preferred Stock  (in millions) U.K.I preferred stock $ 2,862  $ 2,516 Europe preferred stock 3,642  3,201 Total $ 6,504  $ 5,717 Less: Right to recover for covered losses (34 )  (34 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 6,470  $ 5,683 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2016 . 79 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2016 . Visa Europe put option agreement. On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, effected by the Visa Europe board of directors' exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option. Therefore, the Visa Europe put option was contractually terminated as a result of the transaction. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recorded a $255 million non-cash decrease in the fair value of the put option as non-operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero . See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe . The liability was classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe would elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated P/E differential were among several unobservable inputs used to value the unamended put option. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were no significant impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , these investments totaled $46 million and $45 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 7Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2016 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2016 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. In December 2015, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. See Note 9Debt . These debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 . The fair value of these notes, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 80 VISA INC.

The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2016 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Investments Trading Investment Securities Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

The increase in total net intangible assets during 2016 was primarily related to the Company's acquisition of Visa Europe. Total purchase consideration of $18.8 billion was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value on the acquisition date. Related indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled $16.1 billion consisting of customer relationships and reacquired rights. Upon consummation of the acquisition, the Visa Europe franchise right of $1.5 billion , previously acquired as part of the Company's October 2007 reorganization, was reclassified as a Visa trade name intangible asset as the franchise right permitted Visa Europe's use of the Visa trade name and technology prior to acquisition. Goodwill of $3.3 billion was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired. Intangible assets and goodwill recorded as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition are denominated in euros and translated into U.S. dollars. As such, the change in goodwill balance from the acquisition date to September 30, 2016 primarily includes the impact of $ 39 million resulting from changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period.

Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30% , is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year, commencing June 14, 2016. The Company recognized related interest expense of $399 million in fiscal 2016 as non-operating expense. The net aggregate proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were $15.9 billion . The discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized over the respective term of each note using the effective interest method. The indenture governing the Notes contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2016 . Each series of the Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at the Companys option at any time, prior to, with respect to the 2017 Notes, their maturity date, and with respect to the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2035 Notes and the 2045 Notes, the applicable par call date (as set forth in the table below), at a price equal to the greater of: ##TABLE_START  100% of the principal amount of such Notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest through the maturity or par call date for each of the Notes below at the treasury rate defined under the terms of the Notes, plus the applicable spread for such Notes (as set forth in the table below), ##TABLE_END plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 87 VISA INC.

Inc., and subsequently, Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") entered into a 5-year, unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acted as syndication agent in connection with the Credit Facility; Bank of China, Los Angeles Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Citibank, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., Royal Bank of Canada, Standard Chartered Bank, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., U.S. Bank National Association, Wells Fargo Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Toronto Dominion (New York) LLC, acted as Documentation Agents; and J.P.

The Credit Facility, which expires on January 27, 2021 , replaced the Company's prior $3.0 billion credit facility, which expired on January 27, 2016 . The Credit Facility provides the Borrowers with a borrowing capacity of up to $4.0 billion . Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable rating of senior unsecured long-term securities of the Company. The Borrowers have agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. Other material terms are: ##TABLE_START  a financial covenant which requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not greater than 3.75 to 1.00; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customary restrictive covenants, which limit the Borrowers' ability to, among other things, create certain liens, effect fundamental changes to their business, or merge or dispose substantially all of their assets, subject in each case to customary exceptions and amounts; ##TABLE_END88 VISA INC.

The participating lenders in the Credit Facility include certain holders of the Company's class B and class C common stock and U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, certain of the Borrowers' customers and their affiliates. Note 10Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, the Company assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the U.K. funded and unfunded pension plans. Disclosures presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, comprising only the Visa Europe plans. Disclosures relating to other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan are earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account is credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. In October 2015, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze. As a result, a curtailment gain totaling $8 million was recognized in fiscal 2016 as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost.  The funding policy for the U.S. pension benefits is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Under the Visa Europe U.K. pension plans, presented below under \"non-U.S. plans\", retirement benefits are provided based on the participants' final pensionable pay and are currently closed to new entrants. However, future benefits continue to accrue for active participants. The funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of the U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the U.K. pension plan trustees. Postretirement benefits plan. The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65 . Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the same coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis. 89 VISA INC.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2021 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million . Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The weighted average targeted allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2016 , U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 62% , 34% and 4% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. The weighted average targeted allocation for non-U.S. pension plans is as follows: equity securities of 40% , fixed income securities of 20% and other of 40% , consisting of cash, multi-asset funds, and property. At September 30, 2016 , non-U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 28% , 22% and 50% , respectively. The actual allocated percentage to other category exceeding the target is attributed to the $102 million cash contribution made in September 2016. 93 VISA INC.

Cash equivalents (money market funds, time deposits and treasury bills), U.S. and U.K. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. The fair values of U.S. government-sponsored, corporate debt and multi-asset securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2016 or 2015 . A separate roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2016 and 2015 were immaterial. 94 VISA INC.

Personnel costs included $55 million , $49 million and $46 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the 401(k) plan. The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs: (1) average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure was $67.8 billion for the period ended September 30, 2016 , including Visa Europe, compared to $43.5 billion for the period ended September 30, 2015 , which excludes Visa Europe. The increase in the Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure for the period ended September 30, 2016 is due to the Visa Europe acquisition. Of these amounts, $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. 95 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 The Company maintained collateral as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2016  September 30, 2015  (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,295  $ 1,023 Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,311  1,178 Guarantees 1,418  Total $ 4,194  $ 3,326 ##TABLE_END The balances above included collateral held by Visa Europe as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2016  (in millions) Cash equivalents (1) $ Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit Guarantees Total $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Cash collateral held by Visa Europe is not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. ##TABLE_END Cash equivalents collateral, excluding cash collateral held by Visa Europe, is reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in the Company's name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of customer failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimal losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  Derivative Financial Instruments Designated derivative financial instrument hedges. The Company maintains a rolling cash flow hedge program with the objective of reducing foreign currency exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposures of revenues and expenses derived from and payments made in non-functional currencies during the following twelve months. The aggregate notional amount of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program was $1.6 billion at September 30, 2016 and $1.2 billion  at  September 30, 2015 . The increase in the aggregate notional amounts of the Company's derivative contracts includes the addition of $189 million notional of derivative contracts entered into for Visa Europe after the Closing. As of September 30, 2016 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $17 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $78 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a 96 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $30 million , $29 million and $27 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $58 million of pre-tax losses to earnings during fiscal 2017. Non-designated derivative financial instrument hedges. The Company entered into currency forward contracts during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2016 to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition with additional offsetting currency forward contracts entered into subsequently to eliminate its risk-mitigation positions. All contracts matured during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016. As these contracts were not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses were recorded directly in earnings as part of non-operating income in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recorded net gains of $74 million related to these contracts in fiscal 2016. Subsequent to the acquisition of Visa Europe, the Company entered into currency forward contracts to offset Visa Europe hedges outstanding at the date of the acquisition that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the Companys accounting policy. The fair values of both the original currency forward contracts and the offsetting hedges are classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities and non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency held by Visa Europe. As of September 30, 2016 , the aggregate notional amount of these balance sheet hedges was $1.1 billion . The Company did not have any balance sheet hedges outstanding at September 30, 2015 . Gains and losses on the derivative contracts partially offset gains and losses on the hedged monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. These amounts are recorded in general and administrative in the Company's consolidated statement of operations as these instruments are not designated for hedge accounting. Credit and market risks. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements, and except for derivative instruments entered into by Visa Europe, such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2016 , the Company has received collateral of $8 million from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and posted collateral of $54 million , which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2016 . 97 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Additional disclosures that demonstrate how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows have not been presented because the impact of derivative instruments is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements. Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability of $1.2 billion (see Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe ), a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of the Company's euro-denominated net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company's net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the euro exchange rate against the U.S. dollar from the acquisition date of June 21, 2016 to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016 resulted in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $218 million . Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2016  September 30, 2015  (in millions) United States $ 1,827  $ 1,806 International  Total $ 2,150  $ 1,888 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 52% of net operating revenues in fiscal 2016 , 53% in fiscal 2015  and 54%  in fiscal 2014 . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Note 14Stockholders' Equity  Visa Europe acquisition. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. Additionally, Visa Europe holds shares of Visa Inc.'s class C common stock, which were treated as treasury stock in purchase accounting. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe . Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visas board of directors declared a four -for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder as of the record date received a dividend of three additional shares for every share held as of the record date. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. As a result of the stock split, all historical per share data and number of shares outstanding presented have been retroactively adjusted. 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 As-converted class A common stock. The U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, issued in the Visa Europe acquisition, is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of U.K.I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans .

Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END The Company's board of directors authorized share repurchase programs in October 2015 and July 2016 at $5.0 billion each. As of September 30, 2016 , the programs had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2015 have been completed. Visa Europe held approximately 550,000 shares of the Company's class C common stock valued at $170 million at the Closing, which was recorded as treasury stock at the time of the acquisition. Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. There were no deposits into the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2016 or 2015. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2016 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions. A total of 134 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market and approximately 550,000 shares held by Visa Europe were recorded as treasury stock at the time of the acquisition. Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had 5 million shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016 and no shares of preferred stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2015. The shares of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe . Voting rights. The holders of the U.K.I and Europe preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the U.K.I and Europe preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the class A common stockholders in a single class, and (ii) in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Company's common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends in fiscal 2016 at a quarterly rate of $0.14 per share. In October 2016 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.165 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and U.K.I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 6, 2016 , to all holders of record of the Companys common and preferred stock as of November 18, 2016 . Note 15Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of each class of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . 100 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of U.K.I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were ##TABLE_END101 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 405 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 413 million for fiscal 2014. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 75 million , 87 million and 103 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_START (3)  Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 5 million , 6 million and 7 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's U.K.I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. U.K.I and Europe preferred stock were issued as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition and are convertible into a number of shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock upon certain conditions. Participating securities' income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. See  Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  and  Note 14Stockholders' Equity . ##TABLE_ENDNote 16Share-based Compensation  2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 236 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. In January 2016, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment of the EIP effective February 3, 2016, such that awards may be granted under the plan until January 31, 2022. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $211 million , $184 million and $172 million , respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were $62 million , $54 million and $51 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding presented below reflect the four -for-one stock split that was effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 14Stockholders' Equity . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 102 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 ##TABLE_START     Expected term (in years) (1)  4.35  4.55  4.80 Risk-free rate of return (2)  1.5 %  1.5 %  1.3 % Expected volatility (3)  21.7 %  22.0 %  25.2 % Expected dividend yield (4)  0.7 %  0.8 %  0.8 % Fair value per option granted  $ 15.01  $ 12.04  $ 11.03 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  This assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2016 was approximately 77% and 23% , respectively, 67% and 33% in fiscal 2015, respectively, and 58% and 42% in fiscal 2014, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility.

As of September 30, 2016 , there was $19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to 103 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The company discontinued granting RSAs in fiscal 2016 but will continue to grant RSUs under the EIP. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2015 and 2014 was $63.71 and $49.98 , respectively. No RSAs were granted during fiscal 2016 . The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $79.77 , $62.88 and $49.44 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $142 million , $132 million and $126 million , respectively.

The performance condition 104 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $92.71 , $69.78 and $56.37 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 vest approximately 3 years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2016 , there was $18 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.9 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In January 2015, the Company's class A stockholders approved the Visa Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), under which substantially all employees are eligible to participate. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase the Companys class A common stock at a 15% discount of the stock price on the purchase date, subject to certain restrictions. A total of 20 million shares of class A common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The first offering date was April 1, 2015. The ESPP does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 17Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $134 million , $136 million and $134 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2016 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START       Thereafter  Total  (in millions) Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Marketing and sponsorships       Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,174 ##TABLE_ENDSelect sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one year to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa- payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's 105 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2016 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 4,211  $ 3,752  $ 3,211  $ 2,628  $ 2,245  $ 4,617  $ 20,664 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Deferred purchase consideration. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Note 18Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. There were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note 19Income Taxes  The Companys income before taxes by fiscal year consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START     (in millions) U.S. $ 5,839  $ 7,214  $ 6,140 Non-U.S. 2,173  1,781  1,584 Total income before taxes $ 8,012  $ 8,995  $ 7,724 ##TABLE_ENDU.S. income before taxes included $2.5 billion , $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion of the Company's U.S. entities' income from operations outside of the U.S. for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Income tax provision by fiscal year consisted of the following: 106 VISA INC.

At September 30, 2016 and 2015, net deferred tax assets of $22 million and $13 million , respectively, are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as non-current. The standard impacts presentation only. The Company elected to early adopt the standard on a retrospective basis effective October 1, 2015, and all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. 107 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2016 and 2015 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2016 , the Company had $17 million federal, $21 million state and $117 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2028 through 2035 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $15 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards, which will expire in fiscal 2026. The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years. The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% to pretax income, as a result of the following:  ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate $ 2,804  %  $ 3,148  %  $ 2,704  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  %   %   % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit (553 )  (7 )%  (327 )  (4 )%  (278 )  (4 )% Prior years U.S. domestic production activities deduction    %     %  (191 )  (2 )% Remeasurement of deferred tax liability (88 )  (1 )%     %     % Reversal of prior years tax reserves related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions    %  (239 )  (2 )%     % Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (89 )  (1 )%     %     % Other, net (188 )  (3 )%  (109 )  (1 )%  (78 )  (1 )% Income tax provision $ 2,021  %  $ 2,667  %  $ 2,286  % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the U.K. tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 . The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year:  the aforementioned $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015; and ##TABLE_START  a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END108 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Current income taxes receivable were $232 million and $77 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Non-current income taxes receivable of $731 million and $627 million were included in other assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. See Note 5Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets . At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , income taxes payable of $153 million and $75 million , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $911 million and $752 million , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 8Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to $8.3 billion at September 30, 2016 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $235 million , $192 million and $168 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.10 , $0.08 and $0.07 in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740Income Taxes , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion are $926 million and $859 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1 $ 1,051  $ 1,303 Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years (180 )  (413 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year  Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations (2 )  (3 ) Ending balance at September 30 $ 1,160  $ 1,051 ##TABLE_ENDIt is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $15 million and $10 million of interest expense in fiscal 2016 and 2014, respectively, and reversed $6 million of interest expense in fiscal 2015, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued $3 million , $1 million and $2 million of penalties in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , the Company had accrued interest of $61 million and $33 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $17 million and $6 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities. At September 30, 2016, accrued interest and penalties balances included amounts related to the Visa Europe acquisition. 109 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 The Company's fiscal 2009 through 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") examination. The Company has filed a federal refund claim for fiscal year 2008, which is also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claim, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2009. The Company's fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 California tax returns are currently under examination. Except for certain outstanding refund claims, the California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Company's fiscal 2010 through 2015 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. In April 2016, the Company petitioned the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRA's assessments. The Company continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 20Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 1,024  $ 1,456 Provision for uncovered legal matters  Accrual for VE territory covered litigation   Payments on legal matters (47 )  (446 ) Balance at September 30 $  $ 1,024 ##TABLE_ENDAccrual SummaryU.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation.

Following the payment of approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account into settlement funds pursuant to the class settlement agreement, on January 27, 2014, Visa received and deposited into the Company's U.S. litigation escrow account \"takedown payments\" of approximately $1.1 billion , which Visa was entitled to receive under the class settlement agreement based on payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who opted out. The deposit into the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling $ 528 million  were made from fiscal 2014 through 2016 from the U.S. litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $978 million related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2016. See further discussion below under Individual Merchant Interchange Litigation and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Accrual SummaryVE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the conversion rates applicable to the U.K.I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders' equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain Visa member financial institutions. The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their \"no surcharge\" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which, together with the complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. The Company and certain individual merchants whose claims were consolidated with the MDL signed a settlement agreement to resolve their claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the U.S. litigation escrow account on October 29, 2012, and the court has dismissed those claims with prejudice. In addition, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the \"2012 Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the 2012 Settlement Agreement include, among other terms, (1) a comprehensive release of claims asserted in the litigation and protection against future litigation regarding default interchange and other U.S. rules; (2) settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion and a further distribution of 10 basis points of default interchange for an eight-month period; (3) certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances; and (4) the Company's agreement to meet with merchant buying groups that seek to collectively negotiate interchange rates. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors appealed. On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court's certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement. The Second Circuit determined that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its decision. Prior to November 23, 2016, class plaintiffs may file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit's decision. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the 2012 Settlement Agreement. However, the case is still U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 16, 2013, a putative class action was filed on behalf of all Visa and MasterCard payment cardholders in the United States since January 1, 2000, against certain financial institutions, identifying non-defendants Visa, MasterCard and certain other financial institutions as co-conspirators. Plaintiffs allege primarily a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys fees and treble damages in excess of $54.0 billion dollars annually arising from purported overcharges. Originally filed in federal court in California, the case was transferred to MDL 1720. On November 26, 2014, the MDL court dismissed plaintiffs' federal law claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state law claim. Both sides asked the court to reconsider aspects of its decision and filed notices of appeal. 112 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 On February 24, 2016, the MDL court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of plaintiffs' federal claim and dismissed plaintiffs' state law claim based on defendants' cross-motion for reconsideration. On October 17, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims, and on October 31, 2016, plaintiffs sought rehearing by the Second Circuit. Individual Merchant Interchange Litigation Beginning in May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in various federal district courts by hundreds of merchants who had opted out of the damages portion of the 2012 Settlement Agreement, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. In addition, some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa Rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. One merchant's complaint also asserts that Visa, MasterCard and their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market, and at least two merchant groups have requested permission from the MDL court to amend their complaints. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries filed a complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants. Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. In addition, Visa filed three more similar complaints in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; against The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A.; and against Sears Holdings Corporation. All four complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs could seek damages under the 2012 Settlement Agreement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its \"honor all cards\" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. All the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that have been transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . A settlement agreement was reached with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries, which will terminate if, following all appeals, the 2012 Settlement Agreement in MDL 1720 is reversed or vacated with respect to certification of the Rule 23(b)(2) settlement class or the consideration provided to or release provided by that class. Including this settlement with Wal-Mart, as of the date of filing, Visa has reached settlement agreements with a number of merchants representing approximately 51% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. Except for the settlement with Wal-Mart, these settlement agreements remain effective despite the outcome of any appeals from the district court's order approving the 2012 Settlement Agreement in MDL 1720. On June 13, 2016, The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. filed suit against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On October 3, 2016, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the case to MDL 1720. While the Company believes that it has substantial defenses in these matters, the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its 113 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 expectations regarding the outcome of individual merchant claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. VE Territory Covered Litigation U.K. Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 100 Merchants (the capitalized term \"Merchant,\" when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct primarily in relation to U.K. domestic and/or Irish domestic and/or intra-EEA interchange fees for credit and debit cards. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by two Merchants, and one Merchant has dropped all claims that relate to debit cards. After a successful application for summary judgment and an unsuccessful appeal by the claimants, the claims of U.K. merchants should be limited to the six-year period immediately preceding the issuance of each claim. In November 2016, claims filed by a number of Merchants in 2013 are scheduled to go to trial to determine whether Visa has infringed U.K. competition law and is liable for having set interchange fee rates during the relevant time period. If the Merchants prevail, the amount of any loss they have suffered will be determined in a separate trial in the future. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those Merchants claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and we anticipate additional claims in the future. Although not all of the merchant claims have been served and thus the full scope of the claims is not yet known, and there are substantial defenses to these claims, the total damages sought in the claims that have been issued, served and preserved likely amounts to several billion dollars. Other Litigation \"Indirect Purchaser\" Actions From 2000 to 2004, complaints were filed on behalf of consumers in nineteen different states and the District of Columbia against Visa and MasterCard. The complaints alleged, among other things, that Visa's \"honor all cards\" rule and a similar MasterCard rule violated state antitrust and consumer protection laws and common law. The claims in these class actions asserted that merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, passed on some portion of those fees to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold. Plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive relief. Visa has been successful in the majority of these cases, and has resolved the cases in all jurisdictions but California. In California, the consolidated Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases were resolved pursuant to a revised settlement agreement that received final approval and was affirmed on appeal. Certain objectors filed petitions for rehearing and for review by the California Supreme Court that were denied on February 11, 2015, and the judgment approving the settlement agreement is now final. One objector has appealed the trial court's orders regarding the distribution of certain settlement funds, and the denial of that objector's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On December 1, 2015, the objector's appeal from the trial court's order regarding the distribution of certain settlement funds was dismissed. The appeal of the denial of the objector's motion for attorneys' fees and costs is pending. European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. Following the issuance of a Statement of Objections in 2009 concerning, among other things, the alleged default application of Visa Inc.'s inter-regional interchange fees to intra-regional and domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), the 114 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 European Commission (\"EC\") served a Supplementary Statement of Objections (\"SSO\") on Visa Inc. and Visa International in 2013. The SSO concerned, in particular, the application of Visa Inc.'s inter-regional interchange fees to transactions involving a Visa credit card issued outside the EEA and a merchant located in the EEA. The EC claims that these fees violate competition law in the EEA. The SSO indicates that the EC may impose fines. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. All issues relating to intra-regional or domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions acquired in the EEA have been settled by commitments offered by Visa Europe Limited in 2010 and 2014 and endorsed by the EC. Following its acquisition of Visa Europe Limited in June 2016, these commitments are now binding upon Visa Inc. The EC's case regarding Visa Inc.'s inter-regional interchange fees is still ongoing. DCC Investigation. In 2013, the EC opened an investigation against Visa Europe, based on a complaint alleging that Visa Europe's pricing of and rules relating to Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) transactions infringe EU competition rules. This investigation is pending. Canadian Competition Proceedings Merchant Litigation . Beginning in December 2010, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard and ten financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept payment by Visa and/or MasterCard credit cards. A separate action was filed against Visa Canada Corporation and Visa Inc., two MasterCard entities and smaller Canadian issuing banks, but that case has been stayed. The remaining cases allege a violation of Canada's price-fixing law and various common law claims based on separate Visa and MasterCard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the networks' rules. Four of the named financial institutions, only one of which is a significant Canadian issuer, have now settled with the plaintiffs. On March 26, 2014, the British Columbia Supreme Court, in one of the class action suits noted above, Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. , granted the plaintiff's application for class certification in part. On appeal from both the defendants and the plaintiff, the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the class proceedings to advance but limited the time period of plaintiff's main price-fixing claim to prior to March 2010. A motion by the plaintiff to amend its claim to include the post-March 2010 period was dismissed by the British Columbia Supreme Court and that ruling is under appeal. The related lawsuits in Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan have effectively been stayed pending further proceedings in British Columbia. The timing of the lawsuit in Quebec is also being considered in light of the proceedings in British Columbia. The pending lawsuits largely seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief, but some allege substantial damages. Data Pass Litigation On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in Connecticut federal district court, seeking damages, restitution and injunctive relief on the grounds that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were allegedly deceived into incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (\"data pass\"), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. On October 15, 2015, the court dismissed the case in its entirety, without leave to replead. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on November 12, 2015. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks damages \"in an amount not presently known, but which is tens of millions of dollars, prior to trebling,\" injunctive relief and attorneys fees. 115 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. On February 13, 2013, the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of these cases without prejudice. On plaintiffs' appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the lower court's decisions and remanded for further proceedings. On February 18, 2016, the National ATM Council moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit Visa and MasterCard from imposing ATM access fee non-discrimination rules. On June 28, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted defendants' petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the district court issued an order on July 21, 2016, staying the cases pending that review. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral argument in these cases on December 7, 2016. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \" Division \" ) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or \" CID, \" to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter . The Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \" Bureau \" ) has closed its inquiry regarding potential violations of certain regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act focusing on Visa's optional PIN Debit Gateway Service. Notice Regarding EMV Chip Debit Cards . On July 28, 2016, the Bureau notified Visa that the Bureau is conducting an investigation into whether Visa's requirements for EMV chip inhibit merchant routing choice for debit card transactions. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau. Pulse Network On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse also alleges that Visa has entered into agreements in restraint of trade, engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing and tying, violated the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act and engaged in tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys' fees and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visa's conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On January 23, 2015, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 17, 2015, the court denied Visa's motion to dismiss the complaint, and the case remains pending. New Mexico Attorney General On December 23, 2014, a case similar to MDL 1720 was filed in New Mexico state court by New Mexico's attorney general on behalf of the state, state agencies and citizens of the state, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On May 15, 2015, defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, which the court granted in part and, among other things, narrowed the state antitrust damages claims. EMV Chip Liability Shift Following their initial complaint filed on March 8, 2016, BR Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam's Market, and Grove Liquors LLC filed an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., 116 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2016 MasterCard, Discover, American Express, EMVCo and certain financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended complaint asserts that defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty or otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, defined as those merchants throughout the United States who have been subject to the \"Liability Shift\" from October 2015 to the present. Plaintiffs claim that the so-called \"Liability Shift\" violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. On September 30, 2016, the court granted motions to dismiss the amended complaint filed by EMVCo and the financial institution defendants, but denied motions to dismiss filed by Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Walmart Acceptance Agreement On May 10, 2016, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and various affiliates (\"Walmart\") filed a lawsuit against Visa U.S.A. in New York County Supreme Court. Walmart seeks a declaratory judgment that certain of its practices related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards did not previously and would not in the future constitute a breach of the acceptance agreement entered into between Walmart and Visa. Walmart also seeks attorneys' fees and a declaratory judgment that certain of Visa's actions violated the same agreement. On June 29, 2016, Visa answered the complaint and filed counterclaims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as costs and other remedies. In its counterclaims, Visa alleges that certain of Walmart's conduct and practices relating to the acceptance of Visa debit cards constitute a breach of the acceptance agreement and a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that Walmart fraudulently induced Visa to enter into the acceptance agreement. On August 19, 2016, Walmart moved to dismiss Visas counterclaim for fraudulent inducement. Kroger On June 27, 2016, The Kroger Co. (\"Kroger\") filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In its complaint, Kroger seeks a declaratory judgment that certain of Visa's rules related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards are inconsistent with the Dodd-Frank Act. Kroger also seeks damages and other relief related to certain state law claims. On August 11, 2016, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 15, 2016, Kroger filed its opposition to Visas motion to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that Kroger seeks a declaratory judgment that Kroger has not breached its contract with Visa. Broadway Grill On July 12, 2016, Broadway Grill, Inc. (\"Broadway Grill\"), on behalf of itself and a putative class of California merchants that have accepted Visa-branded cards since January 1, 2004, filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa U.S.A. in California state court. Based on allegations similar to those advanced by plaintiffs in MDL 1720, Broadway Grill pursues claims under California state antitrust and unfair business statutes. Broadway Grill seeks damages, costs and other remedies. On July 18, 2016, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 27, 2016, the district court granted leave to amend the complaint and entered an order remanding the case to California state court. Thereafter, Broadway Grill amended its complaint and Visa sought permission from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to appeal the district courts decision. On October 17, 2016, the district court ordered the case remanded to California state court, and Visa's request for permission to appeal is pending. 117 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) The following tables show selected quarterly operating results for each quarter and full year of fiscal 2016 and 2015 for the Company:  ##TABLE_START  Quarter Ended (unaudited)  Fiscal Year Visa Inc.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. On June 21, 2016, we acquired Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\"). Management has excluded the acquired business from its assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level. Management expects to include Visa Europe in its assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 . Management has excluded Visa Europe from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as its acquisition was completed in the last half of fiscal year 2016 on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe represented 4% of net operating revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and 7% of total assets at September 30, 2016, after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded upon Visa Europe's acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Management expects to include Visa Europe in its assessment of internal control over financial reporting beginning in fiscal year 2017. See Note 2Acquisition of Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements included  in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for pro forma information. Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 120 In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2016 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2016 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business OVERVIEW Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients with a wide range of products, platforms, and value-added services. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable, and secure payment network  enabling individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive. To deliver on this mission, we are focused on seven strategic pillars: 4 Our focus, expertise, and assets have enabled Visa to become one of the worlds largest retail electronic payments networks based on payments volume and number of transactions. Visa Network Visa connects millions of consumers and businesses every day through the power of our network. ##TABLE_START (1)  As of September 30, 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As of June 30, 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Transacted on our payment products for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 ##TABLE_END5 Visa operates in a four party model, which includes card issuing financial institutions, acquirers, and merchants. We are not a bank and do not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. Generally, our financial institution clients are responsible for managing account holder and merchant relationships. Visa does not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we do not receive as revenue the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by their acquirers.  Visa Brand The Visa brand is one of the world's most recognized, trusted, and valuable brands. Anchored on the notion that Visa is \"everywhere you want to be,\" the brand stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. In recognition of its strength among clients and consumers, the Visa brand is ranked highly in a number of widely recognized brand studies, including BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Study, Forbes Worlds Most Valuable Brands, Interbrand's Best Global Brands, and YouGov Brand Index. Our brand strength helps us to deliver added value to financial institutions, merchants, and other clients through compelling brand expressions, expanded products and services, and innovative marketing efforts. 6 Payment Security Visa has focused its investments, partnerships, and expertise to enhance the security of our network, and to enable consumers and businesses to pay and be paid with confidence. As payments methods evolve, we are focused on four primary areas: ##TABLE_START  Protecting payment data with a payments architecture that complies with industry standards; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rendering the use of sensitive payment data useless by deploying technologies such as the EMV chip and tokenization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Using predictive analytics, intelligence, and insights to identify and prevent fraud before it happens; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Empowering consumers to actively protect their own financial information and transactions. ##TABLE_END  7 Fiscal 2017 Key Statistics (including Visa Europe) (1)  ##TABLE_START (1)  Figures and period-over-period percentages reflect the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year of fiscal 2017.

We streamlined and integrated our European functions with the global Visa organization and bolstered the European leadership team. We invested in launching a suite of digital products, including Visa Checkout and Visa Commerce Network, and entered into new strategic partnerships, including Klarna and Paypal, to spur innovation and drive usage and acceptance. We made significant progress in our multi-year effort to harmonize our respective technology systems and prepare for European client migrations onto VisaNet beginning in fiscal 2018. Along with our new innovation center in London, we believe these efforts will help bring more enhanced capabilities as well as provide greater scale and additional levels of cybersecurity for our European clients. In addition, we made significant progress in entering into new commercial agreements with our European clients to transition the business from the prior association business model to a for-profit model. These new commercial arrangements have led to an increase in client incentives as we have replaced the rebates in effect under the prior model. Technology Transformation Visa is primarily a technology company. In fiscal 2015, we embarked on a multi-year journey to transform our use of technology. We have increased our technology employee footprint by more than 2,000 globally over the past three years, including nearly 1,000 new college graduates, replacing a significant percentage of our contractor and vendor spend. We are making steady progress on our technology strategic roadmap, resulting in enhanced services in the payments ecosystem and positive impacts to our infrastructure. Since the launch of Visas Developer Platform (VDP) in fiscal 2016, we have made our application program interfaces (APIs) available to our developers, clients, and partners. VDP offers them access to Visa technology, services, and tools, and provides safe testing environments for the development of new digital payments and commerce solutions. We added new services to enable clients to develop support for tokenized transactions and create new and innovative solutions in mobile, ecommerce, and digital face-to-face transactions. 8 Cybersecurity remains a top focus, and in fiscal 2016 we launched our Threat Intelligence Fusion Platform, a cyber command and control center that provides integrated cybersecurity operations to further protect our data and assets. In fiscal 2017, we continued to embed security earlier in the software development lifecycle to further strengthen our security posture. New open technologies have been added systematically to our infrastructure and platform components. We continue to bolster the resiliency of our infrastructure and application services to provide high availability of our client services. How We Work with Partners  Innovation Centers, Visa Developer Program, Certifications, and Startups To drive new solutions in the payments space and accelerate the proliferation of safe and fast digital payments, we opened a new innovation center in London in fiscal 2017. Our innovation centers foster collaboration with our financial institution clients, merchants, partners, and developers across the regions to spur the creation of the next generation of payments and commerce applications and solutions. By providing access to Visa capabilities through an open network of APIs, the Visa Developer Platform allows global partners to transform ideas into new digital commerce experiences. Visas Everywhere Initiative is an innovation program in over 40 countries designed to generate and harness ideas within the start-up community to solve business problems, influence Visa's product development, and support Visa's clients. Visa makes minority investments in companies around the world that we believe will further our vision and strategic objectives, support deeper engagement with key partners, and expand access to payment solutions worldwide. In addition, through the Visa Ready certification program, we provide the structure that allows partners to introduce devices, software, and solutions that can securely initiate or accept Visa payments. PRODUCTS  SERVICES Core Products Debit: Debit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their demand deposit accounts. Debit cards enable cardholders to transact  in person, online, or via mobile  without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. Visa provides a strong brand; the network infrastructure and processing; acceptance; product features and support; risk tools and services; and industry expertise to help issuers optimize their debit offerings. Credit: Credit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services. Visa does not extend credit; however, we provide combinations of card benefits, including technology, authorization, fraud tools, and brand support that financial institutions use to support and enable their credit products. We also partner with our clients on product design, consumer segmentation, and consumer experience design to help financial institutions better deliver products and services that match their consumers needs. Prepaid: Prepaid products draw from a designated balance funded by individuals, corporations, or governments. Prepaid cards address many consumer-use cases and needs including, general purpose reloadable, payroll, government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift, and travel. Prepaid cards also play an important part in financial inclusion, bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products. 9 Commercial: We offer a portfolio of commercial payment solutions including corporate (travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual accounts, and disbursement accounts covering all major industry segments. The commercial category is a portfolio of solutions designed to bring efficiency, controls, and automation to commercial and government payment processes ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables. Beyond payment processing, we provide comprehensive data management solutions, consulting and analytics support, and integration capabilities. We support financial institutions, partners in the accounts payable space, and technology companies as they build and expand their commercial payment platforms. Global ATM: The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network provides account holders with convenient cash access in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent ATM operators. Processing Infrastructure VisaNet authorizes, clears, and settles transactions processed by Visa, excluding transactions within Europe, which are routed through different software and hardware platforms in the United Kingdom (UK) to perform authorization, clearing, and settlement in Europe. VisaNet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers that are linked by a global telecommunications network and engineered for minimal downtime and uninterrupted connectivity. We are in the process of integrating Visa Europe's processing systems with VisaNet. Until that process is completed, we will continue to maintain the current authorization, clearing, and settlement systems in Europe while ensuring interoperability between such systems and VisaNet. VisaNet provides secure and reliable payments around the world and is capable of handling more than 65,000 transaction messages a second. VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, which allows us to analyze each authorization we process in real time and provide value-added processing services such as risk scoring and tokenization. It provides the infrastructure for delivering innovation and other payment system enhancements for domestic payment systems and cross-border international transactions globally. In fiscal 2017 , Visa processed over 111.2 billion payment and cash disbursement authorization transactions globally. A typical Visa transaction begins when an account holder presents his or her Visa product to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction is then sent to the merchant's acquirer and routed to an issuer for an authorization decision. The transaction is either approved or declined and routed back to the acquirer and merchant usually in a matter of seconds. 10 Transaction Processing Services Our core transaction processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing, and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers. Our processing services also address the varied needs of other participants in the evolving payments ecosystem, through such offerings as our merchant gateway and Visa Debit Processing Services (DPS) for issuer processing. Merchant gateway services, provided through CyberSource, enable merchants to accept, process, and reconcile payments, manage fraud and safeguard payment security online and at the physical point of sale. CyberSource additionally enables acquirers and other partners to offer these services to their merchants. Visa DPS provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of Visa debit, prepaid, and ATM products. Value-added offerings by Visa DPS to issuer clients include: fraud and risk services, data analytics, marketing campaign management, mobile and digital solutions, back office tools and services, card fulfillment and management, network gateway services, call centers, and web hosting solutions. These and other services support our issuers and acquirers and their use of our products, and promote the growth and security of our payments network. Digital Products Visa Checkout: Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online and mobile transactions wherever Visa Checkout is offered. Visa Checkout helps merchants attain higher rates of completed purchases from their consumers, a particularly important feature as digital commerce shifts from desktop devices to mobile devices, where shoppers have been less likely to complete purchases from their shopping carts. At the end of fiscal 2017 , Visa Checkout had over 25 million consumer accounts in 26 countries, seven languages and over 1,600 financial institution partners participating, amounting to $3.8 billion in transaction dollars. More than 350,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, accept Visa Checkout. In fiscal 2017, our product enhancement focus was making Visa Checkout more convenient for consumers to sign in and sign up by enabling biometric sign in. We also successfully piloted a stay-signed-in feature that verifies account holders on their device, allowing a consumer to checkout in as little as two clicks. Visa Direct: Visa Direct is Visas real-time push payments platform that allows businesses, governments, and consumers to use the Visa network to transfer funds from an originating account to another via a debit, prepaid, or credit card number. This platform enables faster payments solutions for a range of new use cases, including person-to-person (P2P), disbursements, bill pay, and micro merchant payments. At the end of fiscal 2017, there were over 1 billion Visa debit, prepaid, and credit cards enabled for real-time receipt of funds, providing global scale and reach for partners. Issuers, acquirers, processors, and merchants are able to leverage our existing network connections to build new services, capabilities, and solutions. We have partnered with Adyen, Braintree, Hyperwallet, Ingo Money, OnDeck, PayPal, Stripe and Vantiv to incorporate Visa Direct into their payment solutions. Additionally, in emerging markets, push payments enable mobile applications to allow consumers to use their mobile device to push money to a business account via a QR code for payment of goods and services. Visas scan-and-pay functionality enables low-cost, low-barrier alternatives for promoting digital payment acceptance for small merchants. Visa has successfully launched merchant-presented QR technology that utilizes Visa Direct in India, Kenya, and Nigeria, and is continuing to work on developing common standards for QR code payments to ensure global interoperability, which is key to the growth of the push payments ecosystem. Work is currently underway to launch QR technology with Visa Direct in 12 additional markets over the next year. Visa Token Service: The Visa Token Service replaces the card account numbers from the transaction with a token. Tokenization helps to protect consumer financial information and lessen the risk of stolen card credentials, particularly when information regarding a financial instrument is stored on a device, such as a mobile phone or wearable, or is stored on file at an ecommerce merchant. In fiscal 2017, we expanded Visa Token Service to 29 markets and are actively engaged in tokenizing accounts. We also enabled wearables providers FitBit and Garmin to embed Visa tokens in their devices. Finally, we announced a new program to drive acceleration into Internet-of-Things (IoT) payments. Visa Ready for IoT allows certified third-party service providers such as Gemalto, Giesecke  Devrient, FitPay, Infosys, PriNum, and Inside Secure to connect directly to our token service and become Token Service Providers (TSPs). These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services to support Visa tokens for issuers and token requestors, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, we expect Visa issuers and other partners to be able to more quickly and easily offer secure digital payment services across a wide range of solutions. 11 Merchant Products Visa has a suite of products and services to help merchants reduce their payment fraud and improve their customer engagement. Visa Advertising Solutions, Visa Commerce Network, and CyberSources product offerings are examples of Visas continued investment to deliver industry-leading products and capabilities to our merchant partners. Visa Advertising Solutions is a service that allows merchants to better target and track the efficacy of their digital campaigns. Visa partners with strategic advertising technology companies to help deliver targeting and measurement capabilities using aggregated and de-identified spend insights. Visa Commerce Network uses Visas global payments network to enable merchants to promote relevant offers to acquire new customers, drive loyalty, and increase sales. For example, Uber and Visa Commerce Network have partnered to introduce Visa Local Offers, a card-linked offer program that rewards enrolled U.S. Visa account holders for shopping at thousands of featured merchants in the United States. Uber credits are awarded to the riders Uber accounts automatically on qualifying purchases  eliminating the need for coupons or promo codes. The CyberSource platform enables merchants to manage online, mobile, and in-person payments. CyberSource offers solution packages tailored for merchants, acquirers, and technology partners. CyberSource offers a secure, integrated commerce solution that gives businesses the flexibility to select the ecommerce or point-of-sale platform, financial partner, and hardware of their choice. CyberSource enables businesses to accept payments from over 200 countries and territories across the world through its acquirer and processor connections and its Token Management Service provides a 360 degree view of customer purchases across all sales channels. The CyberSource Decision Manager fraud management service helps businesses minimize fraud losses, maximize revenue, and control costs. The solution combines advanced machine learning methods, a flexible rules engine, and insights derived from billions of CyberSource and Visa transactions. CyberSource's small business solutions are represented by the Authorize.Net brand in North America and the United Kingdom. CyberSource and Authorize.Net capabilities are offered through Visa and our partners. Risk Products  Payment Security Initiatives We continue to develop our suite of risk products and services to help clients minimize risk and enable secure commerce. Visa Risk Manager is a decision-making solution that helps issuers improve loss prevention and profitability through enhanced risk evaluation capabilities. Products like Visa Advanced Authorization evaluate the risk associated with every participating VisaNet transaction. In addition to reducing fraud, clients can increase approval rates by utilizing Visa's risk products that provide more insightful, real-time information and accept transactions that were once deemed too risky. For example, Mobile Location Confirmation, a service that enhances Visa Advanced Authorization by adding geolocation intelligence in real time, informs issuers if their participating account holders mobile phone is near a purchase location. This new data improves the issuers ability to make more informed decisions. Another tool that issuers can utilize across their entire card portfolio is Transaction Controls, which allows account holders to place restrictions on their enrolled cards that define when, where, and how those cards can be used to better manage account spending and security. We have also extended our fraud prediction capabilities to merchants via Visa Transaction Advisor, which provides real-time analytics and identifies suspicious transactions that require additional verification before the transaction is processed. Visa's use of 3-D Secure technology is designed to make digital transactions safer by using risk-based authorization in real-time. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce, an industry leader in digital payment authentication. The acquisition enables Visa to help reduce fraud and support digital commerce. Beyond our risk products and services, we continue to work with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, EMVCo, and other industry standards organizations to develop and support standards for payment data security, EMV chip payment technology, tokenization, and 3-D Secure 2.0. We also partner with clients, merchants, governments, and law enforcement agencies to help identify fraud and share information about security best practices, threat intelligence, and legal and regulatory developments. OTHER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS Visa Foundation. In fiscal 2017, we established the Visa Foundation, a nonprofit public benefit corporation, aimed at enabling economic opportunity for the underserved, with a particular focus on helping low-income micro and small enterprises thrive. In February 2017, the foundation was funded with a contribution of 2.2 million shares of Visa class A common stock to advance these goals. 12 Capital Structure .  In September 2017, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, in October 2017, we used the majority of the proceeds from this new debt to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in December 2017. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. Our portfolio of trademarks, in particular our family of Visa marks, our PLUS mark, and our Dove design mark, are important to our business. We give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers, which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We also own a number of patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems, and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. 13 NET OPERATING REVENUES Our gross revenues are principally comprised of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues. Net operating revenues are gross revenues reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. We have one reportable segment, Payment Services. Revenue Details  14 COMPETITION The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with Visa's network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants. Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology, and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete, creating local networks, or enabling processing competition. We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include: Global or Multi-Regional Networks, which typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and UnionPay. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States, or have a leading position in certain countries. For example, UnionPay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China and is expanding into other global markets. See Item 1ARisk FactorsRegulatory RisksGovernment-imposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China and Russia . Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2016 (1) : ##TABLE_START (1)  UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients, inclusive of Europe for the second half of calendar year 2016. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1109 (May 2017). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products. ##TABLE_END Local and regional networks, that operate  in many countries, often with the support of government influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, have functionality or their brand marks present with the Visa brand on the card or payment device, and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the United States, Interac in Canada, EFTPOS in Australia and Mir in Russia. Alternate Payment Providers, which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels, but which are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the Automated Clearing House (ACH), or global or local networks like Visa. In some cases, these entities are both a partner and a competitor to Visa. Examples of alternate payment providers include PayPal, Alipay, and WeChat. Alipay and WeChat Pay are among the fastest growing mobile payment providers in the world and may pose a competitive challenge to Visa and other international networks outside of China. 15 Other Electronic Payments Networks like  the ACH in the United States are often regulated by local governments. Historically focused on interbank transfers, many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments. MasterCard acquired VocaLink Holdings Limited in 2016, which provides faster payments technology that competes with our Visa Direct offering. We also compete with closed-loop payment systems, emerging payments networks like Zelle, wire transfers, and electronic benefit transfers. Payment Processors, which we compete with for the processing of Visa transactions or which may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors, and other third-parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. We believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations, and business organizations to provide tailored solutions. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. SEASONALITY We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. WORKING CAPITAL Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information, see Note 12Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. GOVERNMENT REGULATION As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks. Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry. Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the United States, for example, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to U.S. financial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the FFIEC are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Visa also may be separately examined by the CFPB as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa, for purposes of various degrees of financial stability regulation, as a retail payment system. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Colombia. Government-imposed Market Participation and Restrictions. Certain governments, including China, Russia, Indonesia, and India, have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks, or processors, including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on processors, or mandate domestic processing be done entirely in that country. 16 Interchange Rates and Fees. An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the United States limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions, the European Union's (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in Europe (as discussed below) and the Reserve Bank of Australia regulates average permissible levels of interchange. Network Exclusivity and Routing. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFRs prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card. No-surcharge Rules. We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation, and legislation. Privacy and Data Protection. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services, and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practices. In many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach, and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost. The changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation, which will become effective in May 2018, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Anti-corruption, Anti-money Laundering, Anti-terrorism, and Sanctions. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the United States. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea), or that are included on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa-branded cards or engage in transactions using our services. Internet Transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict, or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol. Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, access rights for non-financial institutions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us. European Regulations and Supervisory Oversight. In addition, following the Visa Europe acquisition in June 2016, we are subject to complex and evolving regulation of our business in the European Economic Area. Visa Europe has been designated as a Recognized Payment System in the United Kingdom, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of Englands oversight and subject to various requirements, including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the UK financial system. Visa Europe is also subject to the Eurosystems oversight, whose main focus is on the functioning of card payments, as well as the security, operational reliability, and business continuity of the schemes and their payment instruments. Furthermore, Visa Europe is regulated by the United Kingdoms Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the United Kingdom, and ensuring payments meet account holder needs. It also is the regulator responsible for monitoring Visa Europe's compliance with the IFR in the United Kingdom. The IFR regulates interchange rates within Europe, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting, organization, and decision making purposes within the European Union and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in other EU markets and the European 17 Central Bank itself have the ability not only to monitor Visa's compliance with the IFR but also to impose their own oversight regimes. There are other regulations in the European Union that impact our business, as discussed above, including, privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other recent regulatory changes in Europe such as the PSD2 require, among other things, that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non-financial institution players.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks Increased regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, operating rules, and related practices, could harm our business . Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation for more information . In the United States and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues. Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve caps the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits issuers' and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. The EUs IFR places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within Europe (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further restrict these interchange levels within their territories. More recently, in March 2017, Argentina's central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions. In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. For example, government regulations or pressure may require us to allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services, or to have the other network's functionality or brand marks on our products. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. In addition, the European Unions requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and continues to impact the efficient integration of Visa Europe; the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies; our ability to provide effective account holder services; the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk systems; and loyalty services. 18 We are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets, including the United Kingdom and within the European Union. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital, or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. Increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system, including allowing non-traditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles. Regulators around the world increasingly take note of each others approaches to regulating the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments. Additionally, regulation in an individual country could expand. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues. For these reasons, increased global regulation of the payments industry may make our products less desirable, diminish our ability to compete, reduce our transaction volumes, and harm our business. Government-imposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China and Russia . Governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks, brands, and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations. To varying degrees, these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks. In the future, public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country, which would prevent us from managing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions. In Russia, legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions. The central bank controlled national payment card system (NSPK) is the only entity allowed to process domestically. In China, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Although we have filed an application with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain. The approval process might require several years, and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a BCCI will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks. Furthermore, due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries, we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively. Our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or on-shore processing. Co-badging and co-residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where Visa competes with national schemes for issuance and routing. For example, in China, certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic transactions in China are processed by UnionPay and transactions outside of China are processed by us or other international payments networks. The PBOC is contemplating that dual-branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in Chinas domestic payments market. Accordingly, we have been working with Chinese issuers to issue Visa-only branded cards for international travel, and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a BCCI license. However, notwithstanding such efforts, the phase out of dual-branded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in China. 19 Mir and UnionPay have grown rapidly in Russia and China, respectively, and are actively pursuing international expansion plans. Although regulatory barriers shield Mir and UnionPay from competition in Russia and China, respectively, alternate payment providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have rapidly expanded into e-commerce, offline, and cross-border payments, which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in China. Earlier this year, with strong backing from Chinas government, a new digital transaction routing system known as Netlink was established. The PBOC allowed Alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in Netlink. It and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks . In general, national laws that protect domestic processing may increase our costs; decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed; impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products, services and innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and create new competitors, all of which could harm our business. We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results . As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. See Item 1  Business  Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. We may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, sanctions and anti-corruption, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business. Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us . Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the GDPR, which becomes effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the companys location. The law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including new rights such as the portability of personal data. Although we have an extensive program underway to address GDPR requirements, our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. 20 We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UKs HM Revenue  Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform or those resulting from the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 18Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Litigation Risks We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place . We are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil litigants, governments, and enforcement bodies alleging violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law, and intellectual property law, among others (these are referred to as \"actions\" in this section). Details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive, and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages, or arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements, or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, revise the Visa rules, or the way in which we enforce our rules, modify our fees or pricing, or modify the way we do business. The outcome of these actions may also influence regulators, investigators, governments, or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to the assertion of additional actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation asserted against them, even if Visa is not a defendant. For certain actions like the U.S. covered litigation and the VE territory covered litigation, which are described in Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain protections as provided in the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are able to either fund settlements or judgments in the case of the U.S. covered litigation or recoup covered losses in the case of the VE territory covered litigation. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. Business Risks We face intense competition in our industry . The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves, new competitors emerge and existing clients, and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other closed-loop payments systems, and alternate payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, emerging payment providers, and other digital and technology companies. Many of these providers have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels, and are seeking to expand into other channels that compete with or replace our products and services. 21 Additionally, some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology, more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources. They may offer more innovative or a wider range of programs, products, and services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and greater issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures, or participate in different market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological, and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit, or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternate payments systems, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Federal Reserves Faster Payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR, and in the United Kingdom through the PSR, may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies, including mobile payments, alternate payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others are developing alternate payment networks or products that could disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association comprised of large financial institutions that is developing its own faster payments system, and Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may need to adjust our local rules and practices to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscapes and competitors practices; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by consumers, processors or other third parties, thereby increasing operational costs; ##TABLE_END 22 ##TABLE_START  we may need to agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visas proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing risk of litigation concerning intellectual property, as more technology companies compete with our offerings; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  as this landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new business, products, services and practices; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new or revised industry standards related to EMV chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services. ##TABLE_END Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain . Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options. Market pressures on providing incentives, fee discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts, and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits. In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business. Merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa products. Certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory enforcement, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products. For example, in the United States, the cost of payment card acceptance has emerged in the context of payment security. A number of merchant trade associations claim that EMV cards without PIN cardholder verification are not worth the investment. The October 2015 liability shift and ongoing transition to EMV resulted in calls for a PIN verification mandate. U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process. Some policymakers have called upon U.S. competition authorities to consider potential 23 concerns arising from the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. Additionally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business. We depend on relationships with our financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants, and other third parties . We depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. Our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. For example, in the United States, the EMV migration has been resisted by certain merchants, leading to conflicts and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift, chargebacks, and debit routing, among others. We engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with merchants, who receive incentives from us. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on third parties, including suppliers, and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf. To the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, our business and reputation could be harmed. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, if events occur that damage our reputation or brands or we experience brand disintermediation, it could harm our business . Our brands are globally recognized and are key assets of our business. We believe that our clients and account holders associate our brands with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brands and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The increased use or popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution companies could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand. We may not succeed in addressing consumer confusion and brand disintermediation due to the challenges of evolving digital form factors and ecommerce technologies. Our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data security breaches; compliance failures; negative perception of our industry or the industries of our clients; actions by clients or other third parties, such as sponsorship partners that do not reflect our views or are inconsistent with our own business practices; and fraudulent, controversial or illegal activities using our payment products. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, our reputation is damaged or any threatened or resulting claims arise as a result, the value of our brands may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, and the public, as well as impact our business. Global economic, political, market, and social events or conditions may harm our business . Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses, whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. In addition, almost half of our operating revenues are earned outside the United States. International transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Therefore, adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or slowdown of global trade, could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government, and corporate spending, which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, and natural disasters could impact our operations, our clients, our activities in a particular location, and cross-border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could also reduce cross-border travel and spend. Any such decline in cross-border activity could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues. 24 A decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions to reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced, value-added services from us. Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue. Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See Note 10Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results . In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. Uncertainty over the terms of the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the United Kingdom, may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the European Union and as a result, our Visa rules and contractual commitments in the United Kingdom may be impacted. In addition, because we conduct business in and have operations in the United Kingdom, we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states. These factors may impact our ability to operate in the European Union and United Kingdom seamlessly. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could harm our business and financial results. Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact our future growth . The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, crypto-currencies, new authentication technologies, including biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how these technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of these new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or assertions, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. If we or our partners fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in the payments 25 space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, and harm our business and impact our future growth. A failure in or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business . Our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers, may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. We may also be impacted by breaches of our financial institution clients, merchants or third-party processors. For instance, several merchants have encountered substantial data breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Although these merchant breaches have not had a direct, material impact on us, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business. In addition, numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. The security measures and procedures we, our clients, merchants, and third-party service providers have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. Although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach or system failure, we could be involved in protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from a data security breach or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, a breach or failure may also subject Visa to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions, or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions. We may experience errors, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems, which could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation; result in litigation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and regulatory fines or penalties; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through our business continuity program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise. Structural and Organizational Risks Failure to maintain interoperability with Visa Europe's systems during the integration could damage the business and global perception of our brands . In June 2016, we acquired Visa Europe. While Visa Europe's systems are being integrated with our legacy systems, we will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization, clearing, and settlement systems. As a result, we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories, regardless of where the transaction originates. Visa Europe's independent system operations could present challenges to our business in 26 the event of increasing costs or difficulties in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems during the integration phase. The separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk. Any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between Visa Europe and our legacy operations could negatively affect the experience of consumers using Visa products globally. Moreover, we are beginning the process of migrating European activity onto VisaNet's systems in 2018 and successfully integrating our systems is expected to be time consuming, costly and technologically challenging. Failure to authorize, clear, and settle inter-territory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result . As part of our overall business strategy, we may make acquisitions and strategic investments. For example, we believe the acquisition of Visa Europe positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europes transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise, although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefits. Our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: ##TABLE_START  disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and managements attention from our existing business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to develop the acquired business adequately; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  difficulty implementing controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems, and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to retain employees, clients, or partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with operating in new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1BusinessGovernment Regulations and Item 1ARisk FactorsRegulatory Risks above; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  discovery of unidentified issues after the acquisition or investment was made; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  failure to mitigate the liabilities of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the incurrence of debt; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  anticipated benefits, synergies, or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing. ##TABLE_END We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management . The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations could make it more difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. 27 The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series B and series C preferred stock into shares of class A common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. In connection with the acquisition of Visa Europe, we issued series B and series C preferred stock, which will become convertible into class A common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). Conversion of our class B and class C common stock into class A common stock, or our series B and series C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class A common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class A common stockholders. Holders of our class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series B and series C preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. With respect to our series B and series C preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series B and series C preferred stock would either (i) receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common stockholders. Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control difficult . Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, except for limited exceptions: ##TABLE_START  no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders meeting and may not act by written consent; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  only the board of directors, Chairman, or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, \"us,\" our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2017 reflects continued uneven economic growth around the world. Legal entity reorganization. In February 2017, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. As a result of the reorganization, during fiscal 2017, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe, which were previously recorded as treasury stock. Debt issuance. In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2.5 billion , with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, in October 2017, we used the majority of the proceeds from this new debt to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in December 2017. See Note 8Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Financial highlights. Our financial results for fiscal 2017 include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  % Change (1)     vs.  vs.  (in millions, except percentages) Net income, as reported $ 6,699  $ 5,991  $ 6,328  %  (5 )% Diluted earnings per share, as reported (2) $ 2.80  $ 2.48  $ 2.58  %  (4 )%           Net income, as adjusted (3) $ 8,335  $ 6,862  $ 6,438  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2),(3) $ 3.48  $ 2.84  $ 2.62  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. ##TABLE_END We recorded net operating revenues of $18.4 billion for fiscal 2017 , an increase of 22% over the prior year primarily reflecting the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately negative one and a half percentage point impact to our total operating growth. 33 Total operating expenses for fiscal 2017 were $6.2 billion , compared to $7.2 billion in fiscal 2016 . The decrease over the prior year was primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss in fiscal 2016 resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction, offset by the inclusion of Visa Europe's operating expenses following the acquisition. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. See Note 18Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Elimination of deferred tax balances. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Charitable contribution. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-recurring, non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Severance cost.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Remeasurement of deferred tax liability.  In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss . Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million. ##TABLE_END34 ##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. ##TABLE_END Adjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating (expense) income, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2017 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating (Expense) Income  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) As reported $ 6,214  %  $ (450 )  $ 4,995  $ 6,699  $ 2.80 Elimination of deferred tax balances    %    (1,515 )  1,515  0.63 Charitable contribution (192 )  %      0.05 As adjusted $ 6,022  %  $ (450 )  $ 3,551  $ 8,335  $ 3.48 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2016 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating (Expense) Income  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) As reported $ 7,199  %  $  $ 2,021  $ 5,991  $ 2.48 Severance cost (110 )  %      0.03 Remeasurement of deferred tax liability    %     (88 )  (0.04 ) Acquisition-related costs (152 )  %      0.04 Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss (1,877 )  %     1,184  0.49 Net gains on currency forward contracts    %  (74 )  (27 )  (47 )  (0.02 ) Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits    %  (145 )  (54 )  (91 )  (0.04 ) Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %  (255 )    (255 )  (0.11 ) As adjusted $ 5,060  %  $ (345 )  $ 2,815  $ 6,862  $ 2.84 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2015 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating (Expense) Income  Income Taxes  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2),(3) As reported $ 4,816  %  $ (69 )  $ 2,667  $ 6,328  $ 2.58 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %      0.04 As adjusted $ 4,816  %  $  $ 2,667  $ 6,438  $ 2.62 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Operating margin, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased 77 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $6.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2017 , we had remaining authorized funds of $3.9 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 35 Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted due to the inclusion of nominal payments volume related to Visa Europe for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 (1) . Growth on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, on our international payments volume was not significantly different from growth on a nominal-dollar basis for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 (1) and was 13% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 (1) . Growth in processed transactions reflects the inclusion of Visa Europe's processed transactions for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017 and three months ended September 30, 2016.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The following table provides the number of transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa's networks during the fiscal periods presented.

See Note 2Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2017 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  As a result of changes in Russian National Payment System law, we transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by the Visa network does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after this transition. ##TABLE_ENDResults of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. 37 The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities, and with respect to fiscal 2016 and 2015, revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business, and with respect to fiscal 2016, transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating (Expense) Income Non-operating (expense)  income primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations, and with respect to fiscal 2016 and 2015, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income. 38 Visa Inc. Fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe revenue earned for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is included in International. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)   2016 (2)   2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 8,704  $ 7,851  $ 7,406  $  $  %  % International 9,654  7,040  6,219  2,614   %  % Revenues earned under the Framework Agreement (3)     (191 )  (64 )  (100 )%  (25 )% Net operating revenues $ 18,358  $ 15,082  $ 13,880  $ 3,276  $ 1,202  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Our operating revenues for fiscal 2016 do not reflect revenues earned by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Reflects revenues earned from Visa Europe prior to the acquisition, in accordance with the Framework Agreement that provided for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2017, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately negative one and a half percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth. The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015 also included revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)   2016 (2)   2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 7,975  $ 6,747  $ 6,302  $ 1,228  $  %  % Data processing revenues 7,786  6,272  5,552  1,514   %  % International transaction revenues 6,321  4,649  4,064  1,672   %  % Other revenues       %   % Client incentives (4,565 )  (3,409 )  (2,861 )  (1,156 )  (548 )  %  % Net operating revenues $ 18,358  $ 15,082  $ 13,880  $ 3,276  $ 1,202  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017 , reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 growth also reflected select pricing modifications. ##TABLE_END39 ##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 34% and 17% , respectively. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 79% and 37%, respectively, which includes revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and 2016 also reflected select pricing modifications, which was partially offset in fiscal 2017 by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2017 and 2016 and the inclusion of Visa Europe's incentives for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_ENDOperating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)   2016 (2)   2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 2,628  $ 2,226  $ 2,079  $  $  %  % Marketing     (3 )  %   % Network and processing      %  % Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative 1,060      %  % Litigation provision     (12 )  NM  (86 )% Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss   1,877    (1,877 )  1,877  (100 )%  NM Total operating expenses (3) $ 6,214  $ 7,199  $ 4,816  $ (985 )  $ 2,383  (14 )%  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . ##TABLE_END Total operating expenses decreased primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe recorded during fiscal 2016. The remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses. Additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below. ##TABLE_START  Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2017 driven by higher incentive compensation, combined with continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor costs, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Network and processing  expenses increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. ##TABLE_END40 ##TABLE_START  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to $192 million of expense related to the Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were received by the newly-formed Visa Foundation, as well as an increase in expense to provide product benefits to our account holders as a result of business growth. The increase in 2016 was mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016 as well as net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact. ##TABLE_ENDNon-operating (Expense) Income The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating (expense) income . ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)   2016 (2)   2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  2017 vs. 2016  2016 vs. 2015  (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (563 )  $ (427 )  $ (3 )  $ (136 )  $ (424 )  %  NM Other   (66 )  (443 )   (80 )%  NM Total non-operating (expense) income $ (450 )  $  $ (69 )  $ (579 )  $  NM  NM ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Note 8Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Other non-operating (expense) income in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. ##TABLE_END See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments  and Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Effective Income Tax Rate In February 2017, to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities. As a result of the reorganization, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock. 41 The effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above, recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015. The effective rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, as mentioned above, that impacted the geographic mix of global income resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years. ##TABLE_END Adjusted effective income tax rate . Our financial results for fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2017 and 2016. See OverviewAdjusted financial results within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2017  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate (1)   As reported $ 11,694  $ 4,995  42.7 % Elimination of deferred tax balances   (1,515 )   Charitable contribution    As adjusted $ 11,886  $ 3,551  29.9 % ##TABLE_END42 ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2016  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate (1)   As reported $ 8,012  $ 2,021  25.2 % Severance cost    Remeasurement of deferred tax liability     Acquisition-related costs    Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss 1,877    Net gains on currency forward contracts (74 )  (27 )   Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits (145 )  (54 )   Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (255 )     As adjusted $ 9,677  $ 2,815  29.1 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 9,208  $ 5,574  $ 6,584 Investing activities  (10,916 )  (1,435 ) Financing activities (5,924 )  7,477  (3,603 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  (34 )  Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,255  $ 2,101  $ 1,547 ##TABLE_END43 Operating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of Visa Europe in our results for the full year, while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included Visa Europe. Other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include: ##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition during fiscal 2016 related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $489 million and $244 million of interest on the outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016. See Note 2Visa Europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net purchases of available-for-sale securities. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $6.9 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.6 billion of dividend payments, partially offset by $2.5 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, partially offset by $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities, as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , Note 8Debt , Note 13Stockholders' Equity and Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries, primarily attributable to undistributed earnings, totaled $6.9 billion at September 30, 2017 . Following our legal entity reorganization in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we returned net $5.0 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States in fiscal 2017. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and was not subject to U.S. income taxes. If it were necessary to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on the repatriated earnings. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $12.9 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these undistributed earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.5 billion , are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date, however, are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. 44 Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2017 . See Note 8Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Credit facility. On January 27, 2016, we entered into an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. On January 27, 2017, we extended the term of the credit facility, which will now expire on January 27, 2022 . There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2017 and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2017 . See Note 8Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018. Long-term debt . In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion , with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. We also issued in December 2015 fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, in October 2017, we used the majority of the proceeds from the September 2017 debt issuance to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in December 2017. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of these debt issuances. See Note 8Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2017 , was $1.0 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2017 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Stable  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 45 Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2017 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $426 million. We hold about $7 billion of available liquidity, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2017 , we made no covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2017 , the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.0 billion . In June 2016, the approval of the 2012 Settlement Agreement was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we will have the right to approximately $3.0 billion, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  and  Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased 77 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $6.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2017 , we had remaining authorized funds of $3.9 billion . In April 2017 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $5.0 billion . This authorization has no expiration date. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Dividends . During fiscal 2017 , we declared and paid $1.6 billion in dividends. In October 2017 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.195 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $459 million in connection with this dividend on December 5, 2017 . See Note 13Stockholders' Equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $12 million , $4 million and $19 million , respectively. For Visa Europe's UK pension plans, we made contributions of $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2018 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe's UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $5 million , respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, 46 movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 9Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2017 , due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visa's clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. We paid up-front cash consideration of 12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock, equivalent to a value of 5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016. Also, in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2Visa Europe and Note 6Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2017 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $14.3 billion of assets and $98 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 10Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2017. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 47 ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,298  $ 1,074  $ 4,974  $ 18,386  $ 26,732 Purchase orders (2)     Leases (3)     Client incentives (4) 6,306  8,475  6,663  5,344  26,788 Marketing and sponsorship (5)      Dividends (6)        Deferred purchase consideration (7)   1,331      1,331 Total (8),(9) $ 10,169  $ 11,426  $ 11,857  $ 23,895  $ 57,347 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 8Debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These payment amounts are our best estimates and will likely change materially based on actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 16Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements, which are also estimates that will likely change materially due to the same factors described above. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Includes expected dividend amount of $459 million as dividends were declared in October 2017 and will be paid on December 5, 2017 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 17, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2017 exchange rate. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.1 billion . At September 30, 2017, we had also accrued $84 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 9Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_ENDCritical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives 48 Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2017 , client incentives represented 20% of gross operating revenues. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2017. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 19Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 49 Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2017 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $210 million or loss of approximately $250 million , respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2017 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the Closing, we will pay additional purchase consideration of  1 billion , plus 4.0% compounded annual interest. See Note 2Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2017 , would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million , including interest. 50 We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2017 , would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2 billion . We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company's net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $6.4 billion and $5.1 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $29 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2017 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $241 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $44 million in pension cost. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $433 million and $415 million , respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $433 million and $474 million , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $157 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $11 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2018 , if any, which would be made in September 2018. 51 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). /s/ KPMG LLP Santa Clara, California November 16, 2017  53 VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2017 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\"), Inovant LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world's largest retail electronic payments network  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. On June 21, 2016, Visa acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. See Note 2Visa Europe . In February 2017, the Company completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities to align the Company's corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock. See Note 18Income Taxes . Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity . The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. The Company revised certain fiscal 2016 amounts on the consolidated statements of cash flows to correct a presentation error in gross investing activity. Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities were each reduced by $17.6 billion , from $28.0 billion and $26.7 billion , respectively, to $10.4 billion and $9.1 billion , respectively. The previously reported amounts included purchases and sales of securities, using the proceeds of the Company's December 2015 debt offering, that had a maturity of 90 days or less. These securities are therefore considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes and should not have been included in the gross investing activity. The correction did not affect the Company's total cash flows from investing activities, and there was no impact on the Company's financial position, total operating revenues, net income, or comprehensive income as of and for the periods presented. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. 61 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities at September 30, 2017 and 2016. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. 62 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 4Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding cash collateral held by Visa Europe as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10Settlement Guarantee Management . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 5Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 63 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2017 . See Note 6Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2017 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2017 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2017 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2017 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 19Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. 64 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe (see Note 2Visa Europe ), other revenues also included revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 16Commitments and Contingencies . Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 18Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 11 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 9Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2017, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting in changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company's euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 10Settlement Guarantee Management . 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 15Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 14Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018, and expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company expects that the new standard will primarily impact recognition timing for certain fixed incentives and price discounts provided to clients, and the classification of certain client incentives between contra revenues and operating expenses. The Company is still in the process of quantifying the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and all of its related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which provides guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment will help entities evaluate whether such an arrangement includes a software license, which should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and does not anticipate that this new accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the value of leased assets and liabilities that may be recognized could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including the accounting for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption had the following impact on the consolidated financial statements: ##TABLE_START  The Company recorded excess tax benefits of $70 million in its provision for income taxes rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital for the year ended September 30, 2017 on a prospective basis. Therefore, the prior period presented has not been adjusted. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share, which did not have a material impact on the Company's diluted earnings per share for the year ended September 30, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Company elected to apply the presentation requirement for cash flows related to excess tax benefits prospectively, and thus, the prior period presented has not been adjusted. This adoption resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing of $70 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 . ##TABLE_END In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption will impact the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating a previously required step. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). Currently, all net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are presented in personnel expense on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. The standard will be effective for the Company on October 1, 2019. However, the Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and is considering early adoption of the standard. 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Note 2Visa Europe  On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions Visa to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. At the closing of the transaction (the \"Closing\"), the Company:  paid up-front cash consideration of  12.2 billion ( $13.9 billion ); ##TABLE_START  issued preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock of the Company, as described below, equivalent to a value of  5.3 billion ( $6.1 billion ) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  agreed to pay an additional  1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. ##TABLE_END Preferred stock . In connection with the transaction, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created: ##TABLE_START  series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Companys class A common stock (the class A equivalent preferred stock); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the UKI preferred stock); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Europe preferred stock). ##TABLE_END The Company issued 2,480,466 shares of UKI preferred stock to Visa Europes member financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing, and 3,156,823 shares of Europe preferred stock to Visa Europes other member financial institutions entitled to receive preferred stock at the Closing. Under certain conditions described below, the UKI and Europe preferred stock is convertible into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of UKI preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the \"VE territory covered litigation\"), where, generally, the relevant claims (and resultant liabilities and losses) relate to the period before the Closing. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Final purchase price allocation Upon the Closing, total purchase consideration of $18.8 billion was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation. Based on additional information that became available, which impacted certain of the assumptions used, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation. ##TABLE_START  Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation  Measurement Period Adjustments  Final Purchase Price Allocation  (in millions) Current assets (1) $ 4,457  $   $ 4,457 Non-current assets (2)  (46 )  Current liabilities (3) (2,731 )  (36 )  (2,767 ) Non-current liabilities (2) (2,605 )   (1,998 ) Tangible assets and liabilities (621 )   (96 ) Intangible assets  customer relationships and reacquired rights (2) 16,137  (232 )  15,905 Goodwill (4) 3,268  (293 )  2,975 Fair value of net assets acquired $ 18,784  $   $ 18,784 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Current assets are largely comprised of cash and cash equivalents and settlement receivable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and reacquired rights, which have been valued as a single composite intangible asset as they are inextricably linked. These intangibles are considered indefinite-lived assets as the associated customer relationships have historically not experienced significant attrition, and the reacquired rights are based on the Framework Agreement, which has a perpetual term. Non-current assets and liabilities include deferred tax assets and liabilities that result in net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 billion , which are primarily related to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on the final valuation. In February 2017, the Company completed a legal entity reorganization, resulting in the elimination of most of these deferred tax assets and liabilities.

U.S. covered litigation consists of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START  the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company's IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any case brought after October 22, 2015, by a merchant that opted out of the Rule 23(b)(3) settlement class pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. See Note 19Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 U.S. litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company's litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow account: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016  (in millions) Balance at October 1 $ 1,027  $ 1,072 Payments to opt-out merchants and interest earned on escrow funds (1)  (45 ) Balance at September 30 $ 1,031  $ 1,027 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 19Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a change to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to recommendations made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 . See Note 19Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.'s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 19Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.'s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank's then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.'s certificate of incorporation. On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in 71 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 19Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan UK loss sharing agreement. The Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the \"UK LSA members\"). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of 1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory. Litigation management deed. The Company has entered into a litigation management deed with Visa Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (the \"VE territory covered losses\") between the UKI and Europe preferred stock, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committees for VE territory covered litigation (the \"VE territory litigation management committees\"). The VE territory litigation management committees, which are composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, have also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory covered litigation. 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the UKI and Europe preferred stock, the UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the \"Europe retrospective responsibility plan.\" The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation or remedies or fines imposed in competition law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The total amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The book value of the preferred stock reflects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing. Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a reduction to stockholders' equity and operating expenses, which represents the Company's right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as \"right to recover for covered losses.\" VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than  20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in \"right to recover for covered losses\" as contra-equity will then be recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity. During the year ended September 30, 2017 , the Company recovered $191 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rate applicable to both the UKI and Europe preferred stock of 13.952 at September 30, 2016 was adjusted to 13.077 and 13.948 , respectively, as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had recorded $52 million in the \"right to recover for covered losses\" related to VE territory covered losses, of which $25 million was incurred prior to the Closing. The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and \"right to recover for covered losses\" within equity during the year ended September 30, 2017 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and corporate debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2017 . 75 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were no significant impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , these investments totaled $94 million  and $46 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names, and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 6Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management's judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2017 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2017 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. D ebt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2017 . The fair value of these notes, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Related finite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled $104 million with a weighted-average useful life of eight years . Goodwill of $181 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date 79 VISA INC.

Pro forma information related to the acquisition has not been presented as the impact is not material to the Company's financial results. The increase in total net intangible assets and goodwill during 2017 was primarily related to foreign currency translation, which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet, as well as the additions described above, partially offset by measurement period adjustments as the Company finalized the Visa Europe purchase price allocation during fiscal 2017 .

Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2018. The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.5 billion . Use of Proceeds from Notes issued in 2017 . On September 11, 2017, the Company called for redemption of all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions set forth in the governing indenture. Subsequent to fiscal 2017, on October 11, 2017, the redemption date, the Company redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount. The redemption was funded with the proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017. In December 2015, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes (the 2017 Notes, 2020 Notes, December 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2045 Notes, or collectively, the \"Notes issued in 2015\") in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes issued in 2015 is payable semi-annually. The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2015, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were $15.9 billion . 81 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized over the respective term of each note using the effective interest method. The indenture governing the Notes issued in 2017 and the Notes issued in 2015, or collectively, the \"Notes\", contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries.  The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2017 . The Company recognized related interest expense of $505 million and $399 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively, as non-operating expense. Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Companys option at any time, prior to either their maturity date (2017 Notes) or the applicable par call date (the remaining series of notes, as set forth in the table below), at a price equal to the greater of: ##TABLE_START  100% of the principal amount of such Notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest through the maturity or par call date for each of the Notes below at the treasury rate defined under the terms of the Notes, plus the applicable spread for such Notes (as set forth in the table below), ##TABLE_END plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. ##TABLE_START Series  Maturity/Par Call Date  Spread 2020 Notes  November 14, 2020  10 bps September 2022 Notes  August 15, 2022  10 bps December 2022 Notes  October 14, 2022  12.5 bps 2025 Notes  September 14, 2025  15 bps 2027 Notes  June 15, 2027  12.5 bps 2035 Notes  June 14, 2035  20 bps 2045 Notes  June 14, 2045  20 bps 2047 Notes  March 15, 2047  15 bps ##TABLE_ENDOn or after the applicable par call date, the Notes, except the 2017 Notes, may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at the Companys option at any time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest.

Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. During fiscal 2017 , the Company issued $567 million of commercial paper, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.79% , and subsequently repaid its outstanding obligation. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2017 . Credit Facility The Company is a party to a credit agreement for a 5 -year, unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") that was entered into on January 27, 2016. On January 27, 2017, the Company extended the term of the credit facility, which will now expire on January 27, 2022 . 82 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The Credit Facility provides a borrowing capacity of up to $4.0 billion . Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable rating of senior unsecured long-term securities of the Company. The Borrowers have agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. Other material terms are: ##TABLE_START  a financial covenant which requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not greater than 3.75 to 1.00 ; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customary restrictive covenants, which limit the Borrowers' ability to, among other things, create certain liens, effect fundamental changes to their business, or merge or dispose substantially all of their assets, subject in each case to customary exceptions and amounts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  customary events of default, upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the requisite lenders will have the ability to accelerate all outstanding loans thereunder and terminate the commitments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other customary and standard terms and conditions. ##TABLE_END The Company had no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2017, and was in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2017 . Note 9Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for all eligible employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, the Company assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK funded and unfunded pension plans. Disclosures presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, comprising only the Visa Europe plans. Disclosures relating to other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account was credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. In October 2015, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze. As a result, a curtailment gain totaling $8 million was recognized in fiscal 2016 as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost.  The funding policy for the U.S. pension benefits is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA.  Under the Visa Europe UK pension plans, presented below under \"non-U.S. plans\", retirement benefits are provided based on the participants' final pensionable pay and are currently closed to new entrants. However, future benefits continue to accrue for active participants. The funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of the UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. Postretirement benefits plan. The postretirement benefits plan provides medical benefits for retirees and dependents who meet minimum age and service requirements. Benefits are provided from retirement date until age 65 . Retirees must contribute on a monthly basis for the comparable coverage that is generally available to active employees and their dependents. The Companys contributions are funded on a current basis. 83 VISA INC.

The rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2025 and remain at that level thereafter. These trend rates reflect managements expectations of future rates. Increasing or decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1% would change the postretirement plan benefit obligation by less than $1 million . Pension Plan Assets Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with target allocation ranges. The weighted-average targeted allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is as follows: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2017 , U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 64% , 33% and 3% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. The weighted-average targeted allocation for non-U.S. pension plans is as follows: equity securities of 28% , fixed income securities of 47% and other of 25% , consisting of cash, multi-asset funds, and property. At September 30, 2017 , non-U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 31% , 44% and 25% , respectively, which were generally aligned with the target allocations. 87 VISA INC.

Cash equivalents (money market funds, time deposits and treasury bills), U.S. and UK Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefit plans, to invest in portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. Although the collective investment funds held by the plan are ultimately invested in the common stocks of companies in the SP 500 Index and SP 500 Completion Index, their own unit values are not directly observable, and therefore they are classified as Level 2. The fair values of corporate debt, multi-asset and U.S. government-sponsored securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. 88 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2017 or 2016 .

Personnel costs included $58 million , $55 million and $49 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the 401(k) plan. The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 10Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Settlement at risk, or exposure, is primarily calculated using: (1) an average daily card volume multiplied by an estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin; (2) four months of rolling average chargebacks volume; and (3) the total balance for outstanding Visa Travelers Cheques. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company's settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. The Company's estimated maximum settlement exposure was $67.7 billion for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $67.8 billion for the year ended September 30, 2016 . Of these amounts, $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, were covered by collateral. The total available collateral balances presented below were greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeded the total settlement exposure for certain financial institutions at each date presented. 89 VISA INC.

All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and clients. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment.  Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience, estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients (using, where available, third-party estimates of the probability of client failure). Historically, the Company experienced minimal losses, which has contributed to an estimated probability-weighted value of the guarantee of approximately $3 million and $2 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. These amounts were reflected in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 11Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  Derivative Financial Instruments Designated derivative financial instrument hedges. The aggregate notional amount of the Company's derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program was $1.8 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.6 billion  at  September 30, 2016 . As of September 30, 2017 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $8 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $64 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on the foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded for effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. The excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $18 million , $30 million and $29 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $49 million of pre-tax losses to earnings during fiscal 2018. 90 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Non-designated derivative financial instrument hedges . Subsequent to the acquisition of Visa Europe, the Company entered into currency forward contracts to offset Visa Europe hedges outstanding at the date of the acquisition that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the Companys accounting policy. The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency held by Visa Europe. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016 , the aggregate notional amount of these balance sheet hedges was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. Credit and market risks. The Company's derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements, and except for derivative instruments entered into by Visa Europe, such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2017 , the Company has received collateral of $2 million , from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and posted collateral of $51 million , which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant at September 30, 2017 . Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge As of September 30, 2017 , the Company had designated $1.2 billion of its euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of the Company's euro-denominated net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe. During fiscal 2017 , changes in the euro exchange rate against the U.S. dollar resulted in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $1.1 billion . Note 12Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2017  September 30, 2016  (in millions) United States $ 2,003  $ 1,827 International  Total $ 2,253  $ 2,150 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 47% of net operating revenues in fiscal 2017 , 52% in fiscal 2016  and 53%  in fiscal 2015 . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net operating revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . 91 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Note 13Stockholders' Equity  Visa Europe acquisition. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. Additionally, Visa Europe held shares of Visa Inc.'s class C common stock, which were treated as treasury stock in purchase accounting. During fiscal 2017 , the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares that were previously recorded as treasury stock. See Note 2Visa Europe and Note 18Income Taxes Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visas board of directors declared a four -for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder as of the record date received a dividend of three additional shares for every share held as of the record date. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. As a result of the stock split, all historical per share data and number of shares outstanding presented have been retroactively adjusted. As-converted class A common stock . The UKI and Europe preferred stock, issued in the Visa Europe acquisition, is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of UKI preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities. See Note 2Visa Europe and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The number of shares of each series and class, and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2017 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except conversion rate) Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1) UKI preferred stock  13.0770  Europe preferred stock  13.9480  Class A common stock (2) 1,818    1,818 Class B common stock  1.6483 (3)  Class C common stock  4.0000  Total     2,350 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. As-converted class A common stock is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases settled on or before September 30, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. ##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2017 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 79 million shares at an average price of $89.92 per share. Of the 79 million shares, 77 million were repurchased in the open market using $6.9 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, the Company recovered $191 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because it reduces the UKI and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 92 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The following table presents share repurchases in the open market during the following fiscal years (1) : ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data)  Shares repurchased in the open market (2)  Average repurchase price per share (3) $ 89.98  $ 77.05 Total cost $ 6,891  $ 6,987 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases settled during fiscal 2017 . These amounts include repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2016 for fiscal 2017 or September 30, 2015 for fiscal 2016 and exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2017 for fiscal 2017 or September 30, 2016 for fiscal 2016 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END In April 2017 , the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2017 , the share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $3.9 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table presents as-converted UKI and Europe preferred stock, after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments, for fiscal 2017 . There was no comparable adjustment recorded for Europe preferred stock during fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_START  UKI Preferred Stock  Europe Preferred Stock (in millions, except per share and conversion rate data)  Reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock   (1)  Effective price per share (2) $ 88.70  $ 85.01  Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $  $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Effective price per share is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company's class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company's current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock. ##TABLE_END Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. There were no deposits into the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2017 or 2016. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2017 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions. A total of 139 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. 93 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had 5 million shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016 . The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the Closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the UKI or Europe preferred stock (whether by such 12th anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the holder would receive either class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The class A equivalent preferred stock will be freely transferable and each share of class A equivalent preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 2Visa Europe and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Voting rights. The holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what the Company's class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the UKI and Europe preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock. Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the class A common stockholders in a single class, and (ii) in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Company's common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $1.6 billion in dividends in fiscal 2017 at a quarterly rate of $0.165 per share. In October 2017 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.195 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UKI and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 5, 2017 , to all holders of record of the Companys common and preferred stock as of November 17, 2017 . Note 14Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of each class of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UKI and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock 94 VISA INC.

Participating securities' income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. See  Note 2Visa Europe  and  Note 13Stockholders' Equity . Note 15Share-based Compensation  2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (\"options\"), restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 236 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. Awards may be granted under the plan until January 31, 2022. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $224 million , $211 million and $184 million , respectively, in personnel expense on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were $67 million , $62 million and $54 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding presented below reflect the four -for-one stock split that was effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 13Stockholders' Equity . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START     Expected term (in years) (1)  4.23  4.35  4.55 Risk-free rate of return (2)  1.6 %  1.5 %  1.5 % Expected volatility (3)  20.2 %  21.7 %  22.0 % Expected dividend yield (4)  0.8 %  0.7 %  0.8 % Fair value per option granted  $ 13.90  $ 15.01  $ 12.04 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  This assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2017 was approximately 87% and 13% , respectively, and 77% and 23% in fiscal 2016 , respectively and 67% and 33% in fiscal 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility.

As of September 30, 2017 , there was $19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.4 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The company discontinued granting RSAs in fiscal 2016 but will continue to grant RSUs under the EIP. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs granted during fiscal 2015 was $63.71 . No RSAs were granted during fiscal 2017 and 2016 . The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $81.67 , $79.77 and $62.88 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $163 million , $142 million and $132 million , respectively. 97 VISA INC.

Performance-based Shares The following table summarizes the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned and related activity for fiscal 2017 : ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at October 1, 2016 1,042,012  $ 78.24     Granted (2) 634,651  $ 86.37     Vested and earned (345,797 )  $ 72.50     Unearned (97,531 )  $ 72.50     Forfeited (295,660 )  $ 85.13     Outstanding at September 30, 2017 937,675  $ 84.20  1.0  $98 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2017 of $105.24 by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. ##TABLE_END For the Company's performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of shares to be earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company's earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company's total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $86.37 , $92.71 and $69.78 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 vest approximately three years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2017 , there was $33 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 years. 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In January 2015, the Company's class A stockholders approved the Visa Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), under which substantially all employees are eligible to participate. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase the Companys class A common stock at a 15% discount of the stock price on the purchase date, subject to certain restrictions. A total of 20 million shares of class A common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The first offering date was April 1, 2015. ESPP did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Note 16Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $159 million , $134 million and $136 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2017 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START       Thereafter  Total  (in millions) Operating leases $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Marketing and sponsorships        Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,058 ##TABLE_ENDSelect sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one year to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the estimated expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2017 :  ##TABLE_START (in millions)      Thereafter  Total Client incentives $ 5,049  $ 4,654  $ 4,117  $ 3,658  $ 3,102  $ 5,080  $ 25,660 ##TABLE_ENDThe amount of client incentives that will be recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive agreements is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume, and will likely change materially from the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Increases in client incentive payments are generally driven by increases in payment and transaction volume and hence, an associated increase in revenue. As a result, in the event client incentives exceed the above estimates, it is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Deferred purchase consideration. On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, the Company will pay an additional 1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2Visa Europe . Note 17Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Company's board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. There were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .

As a result of the reorganization, the Company recorded a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. The increase in net deferred tax liabilities reflects the elimination of the deferred tax balances. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, net deferred tax assets of $81 million and $22 million , respectively, are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2017 and 2016 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2017 , the Company had $42 million federal, $27 million state and $140 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2026 through 2037 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had $30 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards, which will expire in fiscal 2027. The Company expects to realize the benefit of the credit carryforwards in future years. 101 VISA INC.

Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock. The effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above, recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09.

Non-current income taxes receivable of $755 million and $731 million were included in other assets at September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , income taxes payable of $243 million  and $153 million , respectively, were included in accrued income taxes as part of accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes of $1.1 billion and $911 million , respectively, were included in other long-term liabilities. See Note 7Accrued and Other Liabilities . Cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States amounted to $12.9 billion at September 30, 2017 . The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. The Companys largest operating hub outside the United States is located in Singapore. It operates under a tax incentive agreement which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive agreement decreased Singapore tax by $252 million , $235 million and $192 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive agreement on diluted earnings per share was $0.11 , $0.10 and $0.08 in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740Income Taxes , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion are $1.1 billion and $926 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period.

The Company recognized $23 million and $15 million of interest expense in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, and reversed $6 million of interest expense in fiscal 2015, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued $1 million , $3 million and $1 million of penalties in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , the Company had accrued interest of $84 million and $61 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $34 million and $17 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, accrued interest and penalties balances included amounts related to the Visa Europe acquisition and measurement period adjustments. 103 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 The Company's fiscal 2009 through 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. The Company has filed a federal refund claim for fiscal year 2008, which is also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claim, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2009. The Company's fiscal years 2006 through 2011 California tax returns are currently under examination. The California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Company's fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Company's fiscal 2010 through 2016 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. In April 2016, the Company petitioned the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRA's assessments. Legal proceedings continue to be in progress. The Company continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company's unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 19Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management's understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee.

As a result of appeals brought by certain merchants, however, the final judgment order was reversed by the court of appeals on June 30, 2016, and the case was remanded to the MDL 1720 court for further proceedings. Subsequently, on March 3, 2017, the MDL 1720 court ordered, among other things, that the deadline to terminate the class settlement agreement be modified to extend indefinitely and that the settlement funds continue to be administered by the settlement escrow agent until such time as the settlement agreement is finally terminated. See further discussion below under Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Putative Class Actions . Visa initially made a payment of approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account into the settlement fund pursuant to the class settlement agreement. Thereafter, on January 27, 2014, Visa received and deposited into the Company's U.S. litigation escrow account \"takedown payments\" of approximately $1.1 billion , which Visa was entitled to receive under the class settlement agreement based on payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who opted out of the 2012 class settlement agreement. The deposit into the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued litigation to address \"opt-out\" claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling $ 528 million  were made from fiscal 2014 through 2017 from the U.S. litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual merchants that had opted out of the class settlement, resulting in an accrued balance of $978 million related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2017. See further discussion below under Interchange Multidistrict Litigation  (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions and Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Accrual SummaryVE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the conversion rates applicable to the UKI preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders' equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

The complaints challenged, among other things, Visa's and MasterCard's purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their \"no surcharge\" rules, and alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees under the federal antitrust laws, and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint which, together with the complaints brought by individual merchants, sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief. The class plaintiffs also filed a Second Supplemental Class Action Complaint against Visa Inc. and certain member financial institutions challenging Visa's reorganization and IPO under the antitrust laws and seeking unspecified money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order that the IPO be unwound. The Company and certain individual merchants whose claims were consolidated with the MDL signed a settlement agreement to resolve their claims against the Company for approximately $350 million . This payment was made from the U.S. litigation escrow account on October 29, 2012, and the court has dismissed those claims with prejudice. In addition, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the \"2012 Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims. The terms of the 2012 Settlement Agreement included, among other terms, (1) a comprehensive release of claims asserted in the litigation and protection against future litigation regarding default interchange and other U.S. rules; (2) settlement payments from the Company of approximately $4.0 billion and a further distribution of 10 basis points of default interchange for an eight -month period; (3) certain modifications to the Company's rules, including modifications to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances; and (4) the Company's agreement to meet with merchant buying groups that seek to collectively negotiate interchange rates. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement, from which a number of objectors appealed. On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court's certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement. The Second Circuit determined that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its decision. On November 23, 2016, class plaintiffs that signed the 2012 Settlement Agreement filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. 106 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 On November 30, 2016, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a Damages Class and an Injunctive Relief Class. Following the district courts order, on February 8, 2017, plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class sought leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. The complaint sought money damages alleged to range in the tens of billions of dollars (subject to trebling), as well as attorneys' fees and injunctive relief, and named as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, and certain U.S. financial institutions. The plaintiffs asserted that the proposed complaint updated, among other things, claims for damages and accounted for industry developments. Defendants opposed the Damages Class plaintiffs motion on March 10, 2017. On September 27, 2017, the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part the motion seeking leave to amend the complaint, and plaintiffs objected to the portions of the magistrate judge's order denying their motion on October 23, 2017. Plaintiffs filed the Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on October 27, 2017. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a class action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees. That complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against: the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. The complaint names as defendants Visa Inc., MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, and certain U.S. financial institutions. The putative class actions are considered U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions Beginning in May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in various federal district courts by hundreds of merchants who had opted out of the damages portion of the 2012 Settlement Agreement, generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. In addition, some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. One merchant's complaint also asserts that Visa, MasterCard and their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries filed a complaint that also adds Visa Europe Limited and Visa Europe Services Inc. as defendants. Beginning on February 8, 2017, certain individual merchants filed motions in existing actions in MDL 1720 requesting leave to amend their complaints. The proposed amended complaints, among other things, added claims for injunctive relief and updated claims for damages . As with the Damages Classs motion, the magistrate judge granted in part and denied in part the motions seeking leave to amend these complaints and, on October 23, 2017, these plaintiffs also objected to the portion of the magistrate judge's order denying their motions. The individual merchants then filed the amended complaints on October 27, 2017. In addition, certain individual merchants have filed new actions in federal court which were subsequently included in MDL 1720. In addition to the cases filed by individual merchants, Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York against certain named class representative plaintiffs who had opted out or stated their intention to opt out of the damages portion of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. In addition, Visa filed three more similar complaints in the Eastern District of New York against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; against The Home Depot, Inc. and Home Depot U.S.A.; and against Sears Holdings Corporation. All four complaints seek a declaration that, from January 1, 2004 to November 27, 2012, the time period for which opt-outs could seek damages under the 2012 Settlement Agreement, Visa's conduct in, among other things, continuing to set default interchange rates, maintaining its \"honor all cards\" rule, enforcing certain rules relating to merchants, and restructuring itself, did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. 107 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 All the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Cases that have been transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720 are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, unless otherwise noted. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . A number of individual merchant actions previously filed have been settled, and remain settled. In addition, following the automatic termination of the settlement agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Visa and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. entered into a new, unconditional settlement agreement on October 31, 2017. Consequently, as of the filing date, Visa has reached settlement agreements with individual merchants representing approximately 51% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. Finally, certain merchants filed actions in state courts, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On July 12, 2016, Broadway Grill, Inc. (\"Broadway Grill\"), on behalf of itself and a putative class of California merchants that have accepted Visa-branded cards since January 1, 2004, filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa U.S.A. in California state court. On February 17, 2017, a merchant filed a case in Texas state court. Both cases were subsequently removed from their respective state courts to federal district courts and, thereafter, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued orders transferring the cases to MDL 1720. Both matters are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . While the Company believes that it has substantial defenses in these matters, the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of individual merchant claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. VE Territory Covered Litigation UK Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 300 Merchants (the capitalized term \"Merchant,\" when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions: UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 75 Merchants, leaving more than 200 Merchants with outstanding claims. In November 2016, a trial commenced relating to claims filed by a number of Merchants. All of these Merchants except one settled before the trial concluded in March 2017. A decision is pending with respect to that remaining Merchant . If the Merchant prevails, the amount of any loss it suffered will be determined in a separate trial in the future. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those Merchants claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future. The full scope of damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been served and Visa has substantial defenses. However, the total damages sought in the outstanding claims that have been issued, served and/or preserved likely amounts to more than one billion dollars . 108 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Other Litigation European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. Following the issuance of a Statement of Objections in 2009 concerning, among other things, the alleged default application of Visa Inc.'s inter-regional interchange fees to intra-regional and domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions in the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Commission (EC) served a Supplementary Statement of Objections (SSO) on Visa Inc. and Visa International in 2013 and a revised SSO in August 2017. The revised SSO concerns only the application of Visa Inc.'s inter-regional interchange fees to transactions involving Visa consumer debit and credit cards issued outside of the Visa Europe region and used at merchants located within the EEA. The EC continues to claim that inter-regional interchange fees violate EEA competition law and may impose fines in the event that it adopts an infringement decision. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. The Commission may also require Visa to reduce the default inter-regional interchange rates the Company sets, revise the Visa rules or the way in which the Company enforces its rules, or otherwise modify the way the Company does business. All issues relating to intra-regional or domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions acquired in the EEA were settled by commitments offered by Visa Europe Limited in 2010 and 2014 respectively, and endorsed by the EC. The debit commitments have expired, but the credit commitments apply until March 2018. Following its acquisition of Visa Europe Limited in June 2016, the credit commitments are binding upon Visa Inc. DCC Investigation. In 2013, the EC opened an investigation against Visa Europe, based on a complaint alleging that Visa Europe's pricing of and rules relating to Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) transactions infringe EU competition rules. This investigation is pending. Canadian Competition Proceedings Merchant Litigation . Beginning in December 2010, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard and ten financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept payment by Visa and/or MasterCard credit cards. Three separate actions were filed (including one against Visa Canada Corporation and Visa Inc., two MasterCard entities and smaller Canadian issuing banks), but those three cases have been discontinued. The remaining cases allege a violation of Canada's price-fixing law and various common law claims based on separate Visa and MasterCard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the networks' rules. Five of the named financial institutions have now settled with the plaintiffs, and one of these settlements is awaiting court approval. On March 26, 2014, the British Columbia Supreme Court, in one of the class action suits noted above, Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. , granted the plaintiff's application for class certification in part. On appeal from both the defendants and the plaintiff, the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the class proceedings to advance but limited the time period of plaintiff's main price-fixing claim to prior to March 2010. The related lawsuits in Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan have effectively been stayed pending further proceedings in British Columbia. The Quebec case is proceeding to class authorization in November 2017. On June 2, 2017, Visa executed an agreement with merchant class plaintiffs to settle, on a national basis, the active class actions filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The agreement is subject to final court approval across all of these provinces. 109 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Data Pass Litigation On November 19, 2010, a consumer filed an amended class action complaint against Webloyalty.com, Inc., Gamestop Corporation, and Visa Inc. in Connecticut federal district court, seeking damages, restitution and injunctive relief on the grounds that consumers who made online purchases at merchants were allegedly deceived into incurring charges for services from Webloyalty.com through the unauthorized passing of cardholder account information during the sales transaction (\"data pass\"), in violation of federal and state consumer protection statutes and common law. On October 15, 2015, the court dismissed the case in its entirety, without leave to replead. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on November 12, 2015. On December 20, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal as to certain claims against Gamestop Corporation, Webloyalty.com, Inc. and Visa, vacated the dismissal as to certain claims against Webloyalty and Gamestop, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the remaining claims. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa's rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. These cases are proceeding in the district court. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the \"Division\") issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or \"CID,\" to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa's competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa's fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Pulse Network On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse also alleges that Visa has entered into agreements in restraint of trade, engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing and tying, violated the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act and engaged in tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys' fees and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visa's conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On January 23, 2015, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 17, 2015, the court denied Visa's motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 15, 2017, Visa moved for summary judgment. New Mexico Attorney General On December 23, 2014, a case was filed in New Mexico state court by New Mexico's attorney general on behalf of the state, state agencies and citizens of the state, generally pursuing claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. On May 15, 2015, defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, which the court granted in part; the courts order, among other things, narrowed the state antitrust damages claims. 110 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 EMV Chip Liability Shift Following their initial complaint filed on March 8, 2016, BR Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam's Market, and Grove Liquors LLC filed an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, Discover, American Express, EMVCo and certain financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended complaint asserts that defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty or otherwise rejected payment card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, defined as those merchants throughout the United States who have been subjected to the \"Liability Shift\" since October 2015. Plaintiffs claim that the so-called \"Liability Shift\" violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. On September 30, 2016, the court granted motions to dismiss the amended complaint filed by EMVCo and the financial institution defendants, but denied motions to dismiss filed by Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, American Express and Discover. On March 10, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On May 4, 2017, the district court granted a motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which has clarified that this case is not part of MDL 1720. Walmart Acceptance Agreement On May 10, 2016, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and various affiliates (\"Walmart\") filed a lawsuit against Visa U.S.A. in New York County Supreme Court. Walmart seeks a declaratory judgment that certain of its practices related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards did not previously and would not in the future constitute a breach of the acceptance agreement entered into between Walmart and Visa. Walmart also seeks attorneys' fees and a declaratory judgment that certain of Visa's actions violated the same agreement. On June 29, 2016, Visa answered the complaint and filed counterclaims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as costs and other remedies. In its counterclaims, Visa alleges that certain of Walmart's conduct and practices relating to the acceptance of Visa debit cards constitute a breach of the acceptance agreement and a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and that Walmart fraudulently induced Visa to enter into the acceptance agreement. In February 2017, the Court granted Walmarts motion to dismiss Visas counterclaim for fraudulent inducement. Thereafter, Walmart filed a motion for summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim, and Visa subsequently filed a motion to dismiss Walmart's claim. The parties then reached a settlement agreement, and the case has been dismissed. Kroger On June 27, 2016, The Kroger Co. (\"Kroger\") filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In its complaint, Kroger seeks a declaratory judgment that certain of Visa's rules related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards are inconsistent with the Dodd-Frank Act. Kroger also seeks damages and other relief related to certain state law claims. On September 29, 2017, the court granted Visa's motion to dismiss Kroger's claims for declaratory judgment but denied Visas motion to dismiss Kroger's state law claims for damages and other relief. Kroger subsequently amended its complaint, adding claims for declaratory judgment that certain of its actions or policies did not violate a commercial agreement between Kroger and Visa and seeking other relief under additional state law claims. On November 13, 2017, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Nuts for Candy On April 5, 2017, plaintiff Nuts for Candy, on behalf of itself and a putative class of California merchants that have accepted Visa-branded cards since January 1, 2004, filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa U.S.A. in California state court. Similar to plaintiff Broadway Grill, discussed above in Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions , Nuts for Candy pursues claims under California state antitrust and unfair business statutes. Nuts for Candy seeks damages, costs and other remedies. On September 6, 2017, Visa moved to stay Nuts for Candys action pending the outcome of the Broadway Grill action, which was denied by the court on October 5. On November 9, 2017, Visa moved for summary adjudication of Nuts for Candy's California unfair business statute claims. 111 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2017 Korea Fair Trade Commission Following complaints lodged by certain financial institutions in Korea, in November 2016, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) initiated an investigation into certain pricing changes applicable to Visa financial institutions in Korea. Visa is cooperating with the KFTC. Ohio Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand On January 19, 2017, the State of Ohio Office of the Attorney General issued an investigative demand to Visa seeking documents and information focusing on Visa's rules related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards, as well as cardholder verification methods and the routing of Visa debit transactions. Visa is cooperating with the Attorney General. 112 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) The following tables show selected quarterly operating results for each quarter and full year of fiscal 2017 and 2016 for the Company:  ##TABLE_START  Quarter Ended (unaudited)  Fiscal Year Visa Inc.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2017 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2017 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2017 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business OVERVIEW Sixty years ago, in September 1958, the first BankAmericard credit card was issued in Fresno, California. BankAmericard became Visa in 1976 and expanded globally. Ten years ago, in March 2008, Visa Inc. completed the largest initial public offering at that time on the New York Stock Exchange. These milestones have helped establish Visa as one of the worlds leading payments technology companies. Though Visa has evolved and grown over the course of the last six decades, our fundamental business model has remained the same: ##TABLE_START  We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our global processing platform. During fiscal 2018, we saw 182 billion payments and cash transactions with Visas brand, equating to an average of 500 million transactions a day. Of the 182 billion total transactions, 124.3 billion were processed by Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products, which our financial institution clients use to develop and offer core business solutions, credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for account holders (individuals, businesses and government entities). Our scale and reach are made possible by a network of 15,900 financial institution clients that issue Visa-branded products. During fiscal 2018, Visas total payments and cash volume grew to $11.2 trillion and more than 3.3 billion cards were available worldwide to be used at nearly 54 million business and merchant locations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We provide other value-added services to our clients, including fraud and risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management, digital services like tokenization, as well as consulting and analytics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We manage and promote our brands to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with the Olympic Games, FIFA and the National Football League, among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations. ##TABLE_END In recent years, we have evolved our organization to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels including ecommerce, mobile and wearables. ##TABLE_START  We have adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We have accelerated the pace of change in digital payments by making application programming interfaces (APIs) available in an effort to increase access to our network, products and services, offering innovation opportunities at our ten global innovation network locations, and building partnerships with new players, such as financial technology companies, commonly known as fintechs. ##TABLE_END 4 ##TABLE_START (1)  Transacted on our payment products for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  As of June 30, 2018 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  As of September 30, 2018 ##TABLE_END Two years ago, our industry reached a milestone when digital payments surpassed cash payments worldwide for the first time. Despite this growth, we have a significant opportunity to displace cash payments. In 2018, approximately $17 trillion of payments were conducted using cash and checks. There is additional opportunity among new payment flows, including person-to-person (P2P), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. Visas Network Our four-party model seeks to facilitate secure, reliable and convenient transactions between financial institutions, merchants and account holders through our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet. VisaNet authorizes, clears and settles a diverse range of payment transactions, and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients with a wide range of products, platforms, and value-added services. In recent years, we have broadened our network model to incorporate fintechs in an effort to deliver additional value to clients and consumers. As digital payments evolve, we are increasingly engaging new partners, including messaging platforms, technology providers, and device manufacturers to capture new payment flows. We believe our network is core to the growth of our business and the expansion of digital commerce globally. 5 Account holder and merchant relationships are managed primarily by our financial institution clients and merchant acquirers, including processors and independent service organizations. Visa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we do not receive as revenue the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by their acquirers. 6 Strategic Focus Visas vision  to be the best way to pay and be paid, for everyone, everywhere  guides our purpose. Our mission  to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable, and secure payments network, enabling individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive  is underpinned by seven strategic pillars: Transform Technology Visa is a technology company. In recent years, we have shifted our proprietary technology architecture to a more open architecture across our software, hardware and networking platforms. The Visa Developer Platform provides application developers with access to certain of Visas products, services and technology via APIs, in an effort to enable business partners to create new commerce experiences and increase the speed and depth of payment innovations that leverage Visas products, services and technology .  Champion Security We have focused many of our investments, partnerships, and expertise to enhance the security of our network, and to enable consumers and businesses to pay and be paid with confidence. As payment methods evolve, we are focused on the following four areas: ##TABLE_START  Protecting payment data with a payments architecture that complies with industry standards ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Rendering sensitive payment data useless by deploying technologies such as EMV  chip, EMV tokenization, and encryption ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Using predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and insights in an effort to identify and prevent fraud before it happens ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Empowering consumers to actively protect their own financial information and transactions ##TABLE_END7 Leverage our World-class Brand The Visa brand is one of the worlds most recognized, trusted, and valuable brands. Anchored on the notion that Visa is everywhere you want to be, we believe the brand stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. In recognition of its strength among clients and consumers, the Visa brand is ranked highly in a number of brand studies, including BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands Study, Forbes Worlds Most Valuable Brands, Interbrands Best Global Brands, and YouGov Brand Index. Our brand strength helps us to deliver added value to financial institutions, merchants, clients and partners through compelling brand expressions, a wide-range of products and services, and innovative marketing efforts. Develop the Best Talent Visas employees are one of our most important assets. Visas approximately 17,000 employees in 119 locations across the world embody our vision and drive our growth. As a truly global enterprise with the integration of Visa Europe, we are adding new talent and expertise to Visa. At the same time, Visa is building a culture of empowered leadership. This focus is intended to provide functional and market leaders greater autonomy and authority to respond quickly and decisively to the needs of our clients and innovate to capture new digital commerce opportunities. Drive Digital Visa transactions today take place across a variety of devices and transaction types. Visa has developed various products, partnerships and platforms in an effort to enable fast and secure commerce on cards, phones, laptops and other form factors. Visa offers a token service, which can be used to replace payment card account numbers with a unique one-time use code, or token, in an effort to make transactions more secure. In doing so, we aim to increase consumer confidence in the security of devices and other solutions that are used to initiate and make payments. In parallel, Visa is supporting and enabling our clients and partners to harness digital commerce opportunities through Visa Digital Solutions. Visa Digital Solutions is a growing portfolio of Visa payment services and authentication technologies that enable tokenization, online commerce and push payment services to be securely embedded in new products. Our growing portfolio of Visa payment services and authentication technologies enable tokenization and online commerce as well as facilitate secure, cost-effective P2P, B2C, B2B and G2C payment services.  Deepen Partnerships Visas business has been built on a foundation of long-standing and mutually-beneficial partnerships. We seek to differentiate our relationships with our clients by offering access to our global network, payment products, value-added services and payment expertise. We have also expanded our partnerships to include technology leaders, governments, non-governmental organizations and fintechs. Expand Access The core of Visas mission  to connect the world  is based on the belief that everyone, everywhere should have access to the speed, convenience and reliability of digital payments. 8 Despite the best efforts of governments and the private sector, an estimated 1.7 billion people worldwide lack access to safe and reliable financial services. Mobile connectivity, new acceptance devices untethered to landline infrastructure and new partnerships are enabling digital payments in remote and challenging environments. In 2018, we made a strategic decision to focus much of our social impact efforts on enabling micro and small enterprises to succeed. Visa and the Visa Foundation are committed to help low-income, financially underserved micro and small enterprises around the world. This initiative is good for small enterprises and the global economy. Sixty-five percent of all new private sector jobs in the U.S. and 60 percent of new jobs in developing economies are in the small and micro-business sector. Fiscal 2018 Key Statistics (1) Please see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of our adjusted financial results. ##TABLE_START (2)  For the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, upon which fiscal 2018 service revenues are based. ##TABLE_END KEY INITIATIVES Visa Europe Integration In fiscal 2018, we completed the final stages of the Visa Europe technology migration, which was a multi-year process that brought our European clients onto VisaNet. The unified global platform aims to increase the speed-to-market, resilience and availability of innovative solutions to our European clients. As a result, clients will see expanded services including greater support of Visa Direct transactions, real-time risk management, tokenization and global dispute capabilities. In addition, we migrated the fraud scoring and case management service in Europe to our global platform. Clients will benefit from a unified security architecture built on multiple redundant layers of cyber defense designed to protect them from data security breaches and service disruptions. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation We reached a damages class settlement in the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation (MDL) in September 2018. The settlement has been submitted to the district court for preliminary approval, and following such approval, merchant class members will be given the opportunity to opt out of or object to the settlement. The district court will then determine whether to finally approve the settlement. This damages class settlement does not resolve the injunctive relief class claims seeking modifications to network rules. See Note 17Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of this report for a discussion of the MDL. 9 How We Work with Partners  Global Innovation Network, Visa Developer Platform, Certifications, and Startups Our global innovation network with ten locations in key markets such as Dubai, London, Miami, San Francisco, and Singapore fosters collaboration with our financial institution and merchant clients, partners, and developers to help spur the creation of innovative payment and commerce applications and solutions. By providing access to Visa capabilities through APIs, the Visa Developer Platform is designed to enable global partners to transform ideas into new digital commerce, payment, or related experiences or solutions. For example, the Visa Everywhere Initiative is a global innovation program active in more than 80 countries since 2015 that tasks start-ups to solve commerce challenges, further enhance their own product propositions and provide new solutions for our network of partners. We also make investments in companies around the world that we believe may further our vision and strategic objectives, support deeper engagement with key partners, or expand access to payment solutions worldwide. In 2018, we made several investments in the fintech industry and unveiled a new program in Europe, which we are implementing around the world, called fintech fast-track. The fintech fast-track program provides an accelerated and simplified onboarding process for startup and early growth-stage companies to become Visa issuers. In addition, through the Visa Ready certification program, we provide the structure that allows partners to introduce devices, software, and solutions that can securely initiate or accept Visa payments. Separately, Visa also launched an investment program to invest up to $100 million to support the fintech ecosystem with the focus on supporting start-up businesses that are innovating in open banking and those using emerging technologies that have the potential to create new commerce experiences. PRODUCTS  SERVICES For decades, our growth has been driven by the strength of our core business solutions, credit, debit, and prepaid products, as well as our global ATM network. The ability to access available funds, a line of credit, or a prepaid account has provided consumers and businesses flexibility and convenience. Core Products Business Solutions: We offer a portfolio of business payment solutions including small business, corporate (travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual accounts, and disbursement accounts covering most major industry segments around the world. Business solutions are designed to bring efficiency, controls, and automation to small businesses, commercial and government payment processes, ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables. Credit: Credit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services. Visa does not extend credit; however, we provide combinations of card benefits, including technology, authorization, fraud tools, and brand support that financial institutions use to enable their credit products. We also partner with our clients on product design, consumer segmentation, and consumer experience design to help financial institutions better deliver products and services that match their consumers needs. Debit: Debit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their demand deposit accounts. Debit cards enable cardholders to transact  in person, online, or via mobile  without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. Visa provides a strong brand; the network infrastructure and processing; acceptance; product features and support; risk tools and services; and industry expertise to help issuers optimize their debit offerings. Prepaid: Prepaid products draw from a designated balance funded by individuals, corporations, or governments. Prepaid cards address many consumer-use cases and needs including, general purpose reloadable, payroll, government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift, and travel. Prepaid cards also play an important part in financial inclusion, bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products. Global ATM: The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network provides account holders with convenient cash access in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent ATM operators. 10 Processing Infrastructure VisaNet is designed to be one of the worlds most secure, reliable and interoperable global payments networks. VisaNet is built on a high-performance architecture that allows us to analyze each authorization we process in real time and provide value-added processing services such as risk scoring and tokenization. It provides the infrastructure for delivering innovation and other payment system enhancements for domestic payments and cross-border international transactions globally. VisaNet consists of five main areas: Software: Sitting at the center of Visas technology platform is a set of commercial software applications powering authorization, clearing, and settlement, as well as value-added services for our clients. Hardware: Our software runs on powerful servers, mainframes and data storage systems that are capable of processing more than 65,000 transaction messages per second. Processing Centers : Our hardware resides in four global processing centers, which are located on three continents. Our global processing centers are designed to synchronize in real time, so that if one system encounters an issue, transactions are rerouted almost instantly and automatically to another. Telecommunications : We connect our clients and partners to VisaNet through a global, private telecommunications network that is designed for redundancies and to provide security and availability of our products and services. Security : Finally, we have multiple layers of advanced security tools to protect our technology footprint at the enterprise, network, operating system, and application levels. To strengthen our security and cyber defenses, we continue to deploy new tools and measures to help safeguard our network and the wider ecosystem from hackers and cyber-attacks. Together, these systems are designed to deliver security, convenience and service that our account holders, clients and partners expect of the Visa brand. Digital  Product Visa Direct: Visa Direct is our push payment platform that facilitates fund transfers by our financial institution clients which allows businesses, governments, and consumers to utilize VisaNet processing capabilities to transfer funds from an originating account to another account via card credentials. The transfer is made with the same level of security protection, network reliability and ease-of-use that Visa uses for other types of transactions. Push payments represent one of our biggest incremental payment flow opportunities. This global platform enables faster payments solutions for a range of new use cases, including P2P, B2B and B2C disbursements, cross-border remittances and bill pay. Visa Direct is currently operating in more than 150 countries. Over seventy of those countries are enabled for fast funds acceptance through Visa Direct, with funds typically posted in seconds and no longer than 30 minutes. Global growth for Visa Direct means enabling acquirers, processors, and merchants to leverage their existing network connections to build new services, capabilities, and solutions with global scale and reach. In certain emerging markets, push payments allow consumers to use their enabled mobile applications to push money to a business account conveniently using an alias (e.g. QR code), for payment of goods and services. Visas QR code scan-to-pay functionality enables low-cost, quick to market alternatives for promoting digital payment acceptance at small and medium size merchants. Visa Token Service : The Visa Token Service (VTS) replaces sensitive account information, such as the 16-digit account number, with a unique digital identifier called a token. The token enables payments to be initiated and communicated to Visa without the account holder or acquirer being required to expose personal account numbers (PANs) that could be compromised. 11 In fiscal 2018, we expanded VTS presence in ten new markets for a total of 40 markets. We also enabled more than 20 new global and regional token requestors in fiscal 2018. Because of the added security measures, token transactions tend to have lower rates of fraud and higher rates of authorization than PANs, a key value proposition for clients to implement and use tokens. This year, we also signed several significant merchants and gateways to use or otherwise participate in our token service. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, we expect Visa issuers and other partners to offer or enable secure digital payments across an increasing range of solutions and circumstances. Visa Checkout : Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online and mobile transactions. This is particularly important as digital commerce continues to shift from desktop devices to mobile devices, where shoppers have higher abandonment rates of their items in their shopping carts. At the end of fiscal 2018, Visa Checkout has over 40 million consumer accounts in 26 countries, driven by growth in Europe and the United States. We also launched Visa Checkout Open Platform (VCOP) in fiscal 2017. VCOP allows digital wallet partners to integrate with Visa Checkout, thereby providing consumers with improved online and in-application payment services. In doing so, consumers have additional options for paying online. We plan to start migrating our Visa Checkout users in select markets to Secure Remote Commerce in mid- to late-2019. Secure Remote Commerce : In 2018, we announced our support of the EMV Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) specifications and the creation of the Visa Digital Commerce Program (Visa DCP). Our Visa DCP platform is an implementation of the EMV Secure Remote Commerce technical framework and specifications that enables a merchant to provide a consistent, streamlined digital checkout experience to consumers, including a common acceptance mark, and to obtain secure customer payment information and enhance the security for digital transactions and stored credentials. Visa DCP includes Visas SRC and Visa Token Service platforms. Visa DCP is planned for launch in the middle of 2019. Contactless Contactless payments allow consumers to tap-to-pay with a card or near field communication (NFC) enabled device at a terminal enabled with NFC technology. Contactless technology offers consumers an additional checkout option while providing the same security as an EMV chip card and helps merchants move customers through their check-out lines faster. At the end of fiscal 2018, nearly one in four of all face-to-face Visa domestic transactions running over our global network were contactless, up from 15% at the end of fiscal 2017. In many parts of the globe, including most of Europe, Canada, and parts of Asia, contactless is mature and accounts for more than half of all face-to-face transactions. Additionally, contactless payments could provide new payment opportunities in areas such as transit. Transport for London has now seen over 1.7 billion contactless journeys and Translink in Vancouver and Milan Metro launched in the summer of 2018. Additionally, many other transit agencies globally have announced plans to launch contactless payments (e.g. New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Singapore Land Transport Authority and Metro Rio). In 2018, we focused on growing contactless card issuance and enabling contactless acceptance in under-penetrated markets, such as the United States. Merchant Products We have a suite of products and services to help merchants reduce their payment fraud and improve customer loyalty. Visa Commerce Network, and CyberSources product offerings are examples of Visas continued investment to deliver industry-leading products and capabilities to our merchant partners. Visa Commerce Network uses our global payments network to enable merchants to promote relevant offers to acquire new customers, drive loyalty, and increase sales. For example, Uber and Visa Commerce Network have partnered to introduce Visa Local Offers, a card-linked offer program that rewards enrolled U.S. Visa account holders for shopping at thousands of featured merchants in the United States. Uber credits are awarded to the riders Uber accounts on qualifying purchases  eliminating the need for coupons or promo codes. 12 The CyberSource platform enables merchants to accept payments online, in-app or on the mobile web, and in-person. CyberSources small business solutions are represented by the Authorize.Net brand in North America. CyberSource provides modular, digital capabilities far beyond the traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing. Using CyberSource services, merchants of all sizes can improve the way their consumers engage and transact, mitigate fraud and security risk, lower operational costs and adapt to changing business requirements. CyberSources global footprint lets merchants accept payments in over 200 countries and territories across the world and includes a broad choice of acquirer and processor partners, payment types and hardware components. Merchants connect to CyberSource directly through APIs or via pre-built integrations to various ecommerce and point-of-sale platforms. Similarly, CyberSource offers the same technology platform to support acquirers as well as comprehensive payment management solutions and support to attract, retain, and grow their merchant base. Risk Products  Payment Security Initiatives We continue to develop our suite of risk products and solutions to help financial institution and merchant clients minimize risk and enable secure commerce. 3-D Secure technology is a fraud detection protocol which provides a data connection between digital merchants, payment networks and financial institutions to be able to analyze and share more intelligence information about transactions to boost security and improve the checkout and user experience. The 3-D Secure standard has been updated and will modernize online security, fully embracing the benefit of always-on connectivity across multiple devices. The new standard will enable ten times more data to be exchanged between financial institutions and merchants, allowing our clients to have greater accuracy in identifying both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. We are also advancing the adoption of biometric authentication as a more secure alternative to passwords, which can be guessed or stolen. To help financial institutions and merchants more quickly adopt emerging biometric authentication solutions, we launched Visa ID Intelligence, a platform that provides a curated selection of leading third-party authentication technologies. Our clients can create, test and adopt new authentication solutions with simple integrations using Visa APIs and software developers kits. Financial data security breaches continue to drive financial institution and merchant losses and can undermine consumer confidence in digital payments. We are investing in more proactive malware and threat identification to help stop fraud and data loss before it occurs. Through our eCommerce Threat Disruption (eTD) capability, we can trace malicious servers and identify compromised merchant websites where skimmer code may have been injected. We have already successfully disrupted criminal servers driving ecommerce merchant compromises. We also conduct testing to identify possible future threats in the context of known vulnerabilities and provide clients with actionable threat intelligence. We are also providing more robust data-driven insights that help our clients improve their fraud and authorization performance. Visas data analytics capabilities and interactive delivery platforms enable our clients to assess their performance relative to peers and test alternate fraud procedures to model possible improvements. In addition to our new initiatives, we continue to improve existing products and services such as Visa Risk Manager, Visa Advanced Authorization, Visa Mobile Location Confirmation, Visa Consumer Controls and Visa Transaction Advisor, which provide data driven tools to issuers, acquirers and merchants to detect and prevent fraud and improve account holder and transaction authentication, as well as providing account holders the ability to track and manage their payment activity on enrolled accounts. Beyond our risk products and solutions, we continue to work with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, EMVCo, and other industry standards organizations to develop and support standards for payment data security, EMV Chip payment technology, EMV Payment Tokenization, EMV SRC and EMV 3-D Secure. We also partner with financial institutions, merchants, governments, and law enforcement agencies to help identify fraud and share information about security best practices, threat intelligence, and legal and regulatory developments. 13 NET OPERATING REVENUES Our gross revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues. Net operating revenues are gross revenues reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. We have one reportable segment, Payment Services. Revenue Details 14 COMPETITION The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with Visas network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants. Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete, creating local networks, or enabling additional processing competition. We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include: Global or Multi-Regional Networks, which typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and UnionPay. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States, or have a leading position in certain countries. For example, UnionPay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China and is expanding into other global markets. See Item 1ARisk FactorsRegulatory RisksGovernment-imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia . Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2017 (1) : ##TABLE_START (1)  UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1130 (April 2018). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products. ##TABLE_END Local and regional networks, that operate  in many countries, often with the support of government influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions. These networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the United States, Interac in Canada, EFTPOS in Australia and Mir in Russia. 15 Alternate Payment Providers, which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels, but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the Automated Clearing House (ACH), global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities are both a partner and a competitor to Visa. Examples of alternate payment providers include PayPal, Alipay, and WeChat. Alipay and WeChat Pay are among the fastest growing mobile payment providers in the world and pose a competitive challenge to Visa and other international networks outside of China. Other Electronic Payments Networks like  the ACH in the United States are often regulated by local governments. Historically focused on interbank transfers, many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments. MasterCard acquired VocaLink Holdings Limited in 2016, which provides faster payments and alternative payments technology that competes with our Visa Direct offering, among other things. We also compete with closed-loop payment systems, emerging payments networks, wire transfers, and electronic benefit transfers. Payment Processors, which we compete with for the processing of Visa transactions or which may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors, and other third-parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, governments, non-governmental organizations, and business organizations to provide tailored solutions. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively, due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. SEASONALITY We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 accounted for more than 30% of our operating revenues in those years. WORKING CAPITAL Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. GOVERNMENT REGULATION As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks. Anti-corruption, Anti-money Laundering, Anti-terrorism, and Sanctions. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the United States. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea), or that are included on OFACs list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in transactions using our services. Government-imposed Market Participation and Restrictions. Certain governments, including China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam, have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks, or processors, including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization, or mandate domestic processing be done in that country. 16 Interchange Rates and Fees. An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the United States limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions, the European Unions (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in Europe (as discussed below) and the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Central Bank of Brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange. Internet Transactions. Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict, or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol. Network Exclusivity and Routing. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFRs prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card. No-surcharge Rules. We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation, and legislation. Privacy and Data Protection. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services, and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practices. In many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data security breach, and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost. The changing privacy laws in the United States (e.g. California Consumer Privacy Act), Europe, Brazil and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective in May 2018, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry. Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the United States, for example, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to U.S. financial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the FFIEC are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. Visa also may be separately examined by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries, including Russia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong. European Regulations and Supervisory Oversight. Visa Europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the European Economic Area. Visa Europe has been designated as a Recognized Payment System in the United Kingdom, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of Englands supervisory powers and subject to various requirements, including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the United Kingdoms financial system. Visa Europe is also subject to the European Central Banks oversight, whose main focus is on the functioning of card payments, as well as the security, operational reliability, and business continuity of the schemes and their payment instruments. Furthermore, Visa Europe is regulated by the United Kingdoms Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the United Kingdom, and ensuring payments meet account holder needs. The PSR is also the regulator responsible for monitoring Visa Europes compliance with the IFR in the United Kingdom. The IFR regulates interchange rates within Europe, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting, organization, and decision-making purposes within the European Union and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in the EU are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in their markets. 17 There are other regulations in the European Union that impact our business, as discussed above, including, privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other recent regulatory changes in Europe such as the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) require, among other things, that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non-financial institution players. PSD2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on Visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences. As discussed in Item 1A  Risk Factors  Business Risks  The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results, Brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in Europe. Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, access rights for non-financial institutions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us. Furthermore, following the passage of PSD2 in Europe, several countries, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico are contemplating granting various types of access rights to third party processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients, which could have implications for our business as well. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Visa Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in May 2007 and we completed our initial public offering in March 2008. Prior to 2007 when Visa was reorganized, Visa served its member financial institutions through Visa International and regional member-owned associations (e.g., Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa Canada Corporation). As part of the 2007 reorganization, these associations became a part of Visa Inc. in October 2007, with the exception of Visa Europe Limited, which continued to operate as an association until our acquisition in June 2016.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results . As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. See Item 1  Business  Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. 18 If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business. Increased regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business . Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation for more information . In the United States and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues. Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example, regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve cap the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits issuers and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. The EUs IFR places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within Europe (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories. More recently, countries in Latin America have also adopted interchange caps. For example, in March 2017, Argentinas central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions. In March 2018, Brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues. In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. For example, governments such as in India may use regulation to further drive down merchant discount rates, which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions. Similarly, the Payment System Regulators review of the acquiring market in the United Kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business. With increased merchant lobbying, we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees. Government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services, or to have the other networks functionality or brand marks on our products. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. In addition, the European Unions requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies. 19 We are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets, including, Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom and within the European Union. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital, or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. Increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system, including allowing non-traditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles. As we develop new product and service offerings to support our clients, the potential scope of regulatory obligations and scrutiny could also increase. For instance, new products and capabilities, including tokenization, and mobile and push payments, could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered. Finally, regulators around the world increasingly take note of each others approaches to regulating the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments. The Reserve Bank of Australia initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well. Government-imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia . Governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks, brands, and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations. To varying degrees, these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks. In the future, public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country, which would prevent us from managing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions. In Russia, legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions. The central bank controlled national payment card system (NSPK) is the only entity allowed to process domestically. In China, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Although we have filed an application with the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain. The approval process might require several years, and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a BCCI will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks. Recent regulatory initiatives in India also suggest growing nationalistic priorities, including a recent data localization mandate passed by the government, which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers. Furthermore, regional groups of countries, such as the Gulf Cooperation Countries in the Middle East and a number of countries in Southeast Asia, are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions. The African Development Bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability. Geopolitical events, including sanctions, trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify this activity, which could adversely affect our business. Due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries (e.g., Russia and Thailand), we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively. Our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or on-shore processing. 20 Co-badging and co-residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where Visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing. For example, in China, certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic transactions in China are processed by UnionPay and transactions outside of China are processed by us or other international payments networks. The PBOC is contemplating that dual-branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in Chinas domestic payments market. Accordingly, we have been working with Chinese issuers to issue Visa-only branded cards for international travel, and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a BCCI license. However, notwithstanding such efforts, the phase out of dual-branded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in China. Mir and UnionPay have grown rapidly in Russia and China, respectively, and are actively pursuing international expansion plans, which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule (which requires that international transactions on Visa cards be routed over VisaNet). Furthermore, although regulatory barriers shield Mir and UnionPay from competition in Russia and China, respectively, alternate payment providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce, offline, and cross-border payments, which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in China. Last year, with strong backing from Chinas government, a new digital transaction routing system known as Netlink was established. The PBOC allowed Alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in Netlink. It and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks . In general, national laws that protect domestic providers or processing may increase our costs; decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed; impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products, services and innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and create new competitors, all of which could harm our business. Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us . Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the GDPR extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the companys location. The law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Although we have an extensive data privacy program that addresses the GDPR requirements, our ongoing efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws (such as the new California Consumer Privacy Act effective as of January 2020 and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law effective as of February 2020) may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. In addition, earlier this year, India adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in India. Such data localization requirements have cost implications for us, impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network, and could affect our strategy. Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. 21 We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UKs HM Revenue  Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as future regulatory guidance on the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tax law changes in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or those resulting from the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, may also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 16Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Litigation Risks We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place . We are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil litigants, governments, and enforcement bodies alleging, among other things, violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law, and intellectual property law (these are referred to as actions in this section). Details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive, and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages, or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements, or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. The outcome of these actions may also influence regulators, investigators, governments, or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to additional actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant. For certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. Business Risks We face intense competition in our industry . The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, and alternate payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, emerging payment providers, and other digital and technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels. 22 Our competitors may develop substantially better technology, have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources. They may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products, and services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and greater issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures, or participate in different market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological, and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit, or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternate payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Federal Reserves Faster Payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies, including mobile payments, alternate payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients and others are developing alternate payment networks or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts, that could reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association comprised of large financial institutions that is developing its own faster payments system, and Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business and some regions, such as Southeast Asia, under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), are looking into cross-border connectivity of such systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  new or revised industry standards related to the EMV Secure Remote Commerce, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card Standards Group and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services. ##TABLE_END23 As the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. We may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visas proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain . Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. In order to stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts, and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits. In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business. Merchants and processors continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa products. Certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, Canada and Europe, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory enforcement, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products. For example, in the United States, certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact the cost of payment card acceptance. In addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and point-of-sale terminals, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process and some policymakers have concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the development of payment card standards. Additionally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business. 24 We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties . As noted above, our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. We engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We also engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with merchants, who receive incentives from us. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on our clients and third parties, including vendors and suppliers, to process transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to our operating rules. To the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation. Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation . Our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the point-of-sale and decrease the value of our brand. Our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including clearing and settlement service disruptions; data security breaches; compliance failures by Visa, including our employees, agents, clients, partners or suppliers; negative perception of our industry, the industries of our clients or Visa-accepting merchants; ill-perceived actions by clients or other third parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, risky, controversial or illegal activities using our payment products. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, and the public, as well as impact our business. Global economic, political, market, and social events or conditions may harm our business . Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. In addition, more than half of our operating revenues are earned outside the United States. International cross-border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Therefore, adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, and natural disasters could impact our operations, our clients, our activities in a particular location, and cross-border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions. The current trade environment reduces the likelihood of having our Bank Card Clearing Institution application in China approved. In addition, any decline in cross-border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues. A decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced, value-added services from us. 25 Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue. Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See Note 8Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results . In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. Uncertainty over the terms of the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the United Kingdom, may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the European Union and as a result, our Visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union may be impacted. In addition, we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states following Brexit. These factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the European Union and United Kingdom seamlessly. This and other Brexit-related issues may require changes to our legal entity structure in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could harm our business and financial results. Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth . The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies. As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. If we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth. 26 A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business . Our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers, may experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. For instance, on June 1, 2018, our European authorization systems suffered a partial service disruption that prevented many cardholders from using Visas European systems for payments for several hours that day. Although that service disruption was caused by a switch malfunction, rather than a cyber-attack, and was limited to the European authorization system, which has since been decommissioned with the processing migration to our global platform, the fact remains that our systems are highly technical and complex and are not immune from errors and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. We may also be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants, or third-party processors. We are aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients, and other instances where merchants have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Although these attacks and breaches have not had a direct, material impact on us, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. The security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, or outage. Although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. These events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and regulatory scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through our business continuity program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise. Structural and Organizational Risks We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result . As part of our overall business strategy, we may make acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: ##TABLE_START  disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and managements attention from our existing business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to develop the acquired business adequately ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company ##TABLE_END27 ##TABLE_START  challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems, and technologies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to retain employees, clients, or partners of the acquired business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with operating in new regions or countries.

The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters integrity, innovation, and collaboration could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series B and series C preferred stock into shares of class A common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Our series B and series C preferred stock will become convertible into class A common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). Conversion of our class B and class C common stock into class A common stock, or our series B and series C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class A common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class A common stockholders. Holders of our class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series B and series C preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. With respect to our series B and series C preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series B and series C preferred stock would either (i) receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common stockholders. 28 Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control difficult . Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, except for limited exceptions: ##TABLE_START  no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders meeting and may not act by written consent ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  only the board of directors, Chairman, or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol V since March 19, 2008. At November 9, 2018 , we had 362 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our class A common stock is held in street name by banks and brokers. There is currently no established public trading market for our class B or C common stock. There were 1,537 and 559 holders of record of our class B and C common stock, respectively, as of November 9, 2018 . On October 16, 2018 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 4, 2018 , to holders of record as of November 16, 2018 of our common and preferred stock. Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common and preferred stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. U.S. Tax Reform Legislation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date and the remeasurement resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018 . In transitioning to the new territorial system, the Tax Act requires us to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. This tax, referred to as the transition tax, was estimated to be $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018 . See Note 16Income Taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Financial overview. Our financial results for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  % Change (1)     2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  (in millions, except percentages) Net income, as reported $ 10,301  $ 6,699  $ 5,991  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 4.42  $ 2.80  $ 2.48  %  %           Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 10,729  $ 8,335  $ 6,862  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 4.61  $ 3.48  $ 2.84  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. ##TABLE_END Highlights for fiscal 2018 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2018 reflects solid global consumer spending growth, supported by favorable U.S. economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets. We recorded net operating revenues of $20.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , an increase of 12% over the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume and nominal cross-border volume. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive impact to our net operating revenue growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2018 were $7.7 billion , compared to $6.2 billion in fiscal 2017 . The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by a higher litigation provision and continued investments to support our business growth. 33 Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Charitable contributions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During fiscal 2018, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million , before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million , determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million , before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million , determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million and related tax benefits of $137 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Acts reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Acts requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Elimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Severance cost. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss . During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe transaction, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. ##TABLE_END34 ##TABLE_START  Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income in other non-operating income. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. ##TABLE_END Adjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START  Year ended September 30, 2018 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating Income (Expense)  Income Tax Provision  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) As reported $ 7,655  %  $ (148 )  $ 2,505  $ 10,301  $ 4.42 Charitable contribution (195 )  %  (193 )   (49 )  (0.02 ) Litigation provision (600 )  %      0.20 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances    %    1,133  (1,133 )  (0.49 ) Transition tax on foreign earnings    %    (1,147 )  1,147  0.49 As adjusted $ 6,860  %  $ (341 )  $ 2,679  $ 10,729  $ 4.61 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Year ended September 30, 2017 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Operating Expenses  Operating Margin (1),(2)  Non-operating Income (Expense)  Income Tax Provision  Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) As reported $ 6,214  %  $ (450 )  $ 4,995  $ 6,699  $ 2.80 Charitable contribution (192 )  %      0.05 Elimination of deferred tax balances    %    (1,515 )  1,515  0.63 As adjusted $ 6,022  %  $ (450 )  $ 3,551  $ 8,335  $ 3.48 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

During fiscal 2018, we recorded an additional accrual of $600 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to U.S. covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2018. We also deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 63 million shares at an average price of $124.29 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in June 2018, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, we recovered $56 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2018 . The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UKI and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . In January 2018 , our board of directors authorized an additional $7.5 billion share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2018 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. See Note 11Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 36 Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit and debit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate was 11% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018. Growth on a constant-dollar basis was not significantly different from the nominal-dollar basis growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 (1) . Growth in processed transactions for fiscal 2017 reflects the inclusion of Visa Europes processed transactions for the full year compared to three months in fiscal 2016.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  As a result of European Union Interchange Fee regulation changes, effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Europe co-badged payments volume is no longer included in reported volume. For comparative purposes, prior year figures were adjusted to exclude co-badged volume. The associated growth rates for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were calculated using these adjusted amounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The following table (1),(2) provides the number of transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY and PLUS cards processed on Visas networks during the fiscal periods presented: ##TABLE_START     2018 vs. 2017 % Change  2017 vs. 2016 % Change  (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 124,320  111,215  83,159  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe. ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information Presentation Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. With respect to fiscal 2016, other revenues also consists of revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.  38 Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business, and with respect to fiscal 2016, transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Visa Europe Framework Agreement  loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating Income (Expense) Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations, and with respect to fiscal 2016, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income. 39 Results of Operations Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe revenue earned for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is included in International. ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)    2016 (2)  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  (in millions, except percentages) United States $ 9,332  $ 8,704  $ 7,851  $  $  %  % International 11,277  9,654  7,040  1,623  2,614  %  % Revenues earned under the Framework Agreement (3)        (191 )  NM  (100 )% Net operating revenues $ 20,609  $ 18,358  $ 15,082  $ 2,251  $ 3,276  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. ##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume, and processed transactions. The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of operating revenues from Visa Europe for the full year compared to one quarter in fiscal 2016. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives in both fiscal 2018 and 2017. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2018 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive impact to our net operating revenue growth. The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other revenues in fiscal 2016 included revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016. ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)    2016 (2)  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 8,918  $ 7,975  $ 6,747  $  $ 1,228  %  % Data processing revenues 9,027  7,786  6,272  1,241  1,514  %  % International transaction revenues 7,211  6,321  4,649   1,672  %  % Other revenues      %  % Client incentives (5,491 )  (4,565 )  (3,409 )  (926 )  (1,156 )  %  % Net operating revenues $ 20,609  $ 18,358  $ 15,082  $ 2,251  $ 3,276  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 12% and 34% , respectively. Fiscal 2018 growth also reflected select pricing modifications. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 14% and 79%, respectively, and select pricing modifications. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield, which was partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2018 and 2017 and the inclusion of Visa Europes incentives for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_ENDOperating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)    2016 (2)  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 3,170  $ 2,628  $ 2,226  $  $  %  % Marketing      %  % Network and processing      %  % Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative 1,145  1,060     %  % Litigation provision      NM  NM Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss     1,877    (1,877 )  NM  (100 )% Total operating expenses (3) $ 7,655  $ 6,214  $ 7,199  $ 1,441  $ (985 )  %  (14 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . ##TABLE_END Total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the $600 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation and our ongoing investments to support our business growth. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for more information on the U.S. covered litigation accrual. Total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe recorded during fiscal 2016. The remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses. Additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below. ##TABLE_START  Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 driven by continued increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. ##TABLE_END41 ##TABLE_START  Marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher spending in support of a number of campaigns, including the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 and 2018 FIFA World Cup TM . ##TABLE_ENDNon-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense). ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)    2016 (2)  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016  (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (612 )  $ (563 )  $ (427 )  $ (49 )  $ (136 )  %  % Other     (443 )  %  (80 )% Total non-operating income (expense) $ (148 )  $ (450 )  $  $  $ (579 )  (67 )%  NM ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Note 6Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Other non-operating income (expense) increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to gains of $292 million from the donation of securities to the Visa Foundation and sales of investments. Other non-operating income (expense) decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the absence of the following: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero. ##TABLE_END See Note 3Fair Value Measurements and Investments  and Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 20% in fiscal 2018 and 43% in fiscal 2017 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements in fiscal 2018; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundations receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock. ##TABLE_END42 The effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% . The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate is a blended rate of 24.5% , which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we provisionally remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the Tax Act. The deferred tax remeasurement is now complete and resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion, recorded in fiscal 2018. In transitioning to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act requires that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. Such foreign earnings are subject to a one-time tax at 15.5% on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents, and at 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. The 15.5% and 8% tax, collectively referred to as the transition tax, was estimated to be $1.1 billion , and was recorded in fiscal 2018. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. The above-mentioned accounting impact of the transition tax is provisional, based on currently available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the new law. We continue to obtain and analyze additional information and guidance as they become available to complete the accounting for the tax impact of the Tax Act. Additional information currently unavailable that is needed to complete the analysis includes, but is not limited to, foreign tax returns and foreign tax documentation for the computation of foreign tax credits, and the final determination of the untaxed foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional accounting impact may change until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by ASU 2018-05. Adjusted effective income tax rate . Our financial results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rates in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2018 and 2017. See OverviewAdjusted financial results within this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. 43 ##TABLE_START  Year ended September 30, 2018  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate (1)  (in millions, except percentages) As reported $ 12,806  $ 2,505  19.6 % Charitable contribution    Litigation provision    Remeasurement of deferred tax balances   1,133   Transition tax on foreign earnings   (1,147 )   As adjusted $ 13,408  $ 2,679  20.0 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Year ended September 30, 2017  Income Before Income Taxes  Income Tax Provision  Effective Income Tax Rate (1)  (in millions, except percentages) As reported $ 11,694  $ 4,995  42.7 % Charitable contribution    Elimination of deferred tax balances   (1,515 )   As adjusted $ 11,886  $ 3,551  29.9 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_ENDLiquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 44 Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 12,713  $ 9,208  $ 5,574 Investing activities (3,084 )   (10,916 ) Financing activities (11,240 )  (5,924 )  7,477 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (101 )   (34 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,712 )  $ 4,255  $ 2,101 ##TABLE_ENDOperating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our underlying business. Fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of Visa Europe in our results for the full year, while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included Visa Europe. Other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include: ##TABLE_START  net deposits made into the U.S. litigation escrow account of $450 million in fiscal 2018; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition during fiscal 2016 related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  payments of $545 million , $489 million and $244 million of interest on the outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. ##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 was higher than the prior-year comparable period as purchases of available-for-sale investment securities reflected additional investment of net proceeds received from new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the $7.2 billion used to repurchase class A common stock, $1.9 billion of dividend payments, the redemption of $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes and $600 million deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, partially offset by payments of $150 million from our litigation escrow account. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $6.9 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.6 billion of dividend payments, partially offset by $2.5 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, partially offset by $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , Note 6Debt , Note 11Stockholders Equity and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 45 Foreign Earnings. Pursuant to the Tax Act, we are required to pay U.S. tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2017. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result of the Tax Act, we are no longer subject to incremental U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the United States. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.4 billion , are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2018 . See Note 6Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Credit facility. We have an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on January 27, 2022 . There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2018 and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2018 . See Note 6Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2021. U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. In June 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2018 , was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Long-term debt . In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion , with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. In October 2017, we redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes. The redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. See Note 6Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 46 Credit Ratings At September 30, 2018 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1  Positive  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+  Positive  A1  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2018 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $931 million. We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018 , in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2018 , we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, and made $150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2018 , the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion . In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. The proposed settlement amount is approximately $6.2 billion. Our share represents approximately $4.1 billion, the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the $600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in June 2018. No additional funds are required for this class settlement. Our share is covered under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. Until the court approves the 2018 Settlement Agreement, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by that agreement. If the 2018 Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into court-supervised settlement funds, we will have the right to the majority of these funds, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  and  Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018 , share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 63 million at an average price of $124.38 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of cash on hand. Additionally, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our Class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 47 In January 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $7.5 billion . This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2018 , we had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. See Note 11Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Dividends . During fiscal 2018 , we declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends. On October 16, 2018 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $574 million in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018 . See Note 11Stockholders Equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europes defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million , $12 million and $4 million, respectively. For Visa Europes UK pension plans, we made contributions of $11 million , $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2019 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europes UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $10 million , respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 7Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018 , due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visas clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 5Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2018 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion of assets and $22 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 3Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. 48 Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 8Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2018. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $  $ 4,041  $ 4,140  $ 15,719  $ 24,437 Purchase obligations (2) 1,375     2,525 Leases (3)     Transition tax (4)     1,105 Dividends (5)        Deferred purchase consideration (6) 1,317        1,317 Total (7),(8),(9) $ 4,071  $ 4,853  $ 4,679  $ 17,102  $ 30,705 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 6Debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 16Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes expected dividend amount of $574 million as dividends were declared on October 16, 2018 and will be paid on December 4, 2018 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 16, 2018 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2018 exchange rate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, we had also accrued $99 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 7Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9)  Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to eleven years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2018, we have $2.8 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. ##TABLE_END49 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2018 , client incentives represented 21% of gross operating revenues. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account 50 balance. We recorded an additional accrual of $600 million for U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2018. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 17Legal Matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2018 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $280 million or loss of approximately $350 million , respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2018 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and  Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will pay an additional purchase consideration of 1.0 billion , plus 4.0% compounded annual interest. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018 , would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million , including interest. 51 We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018 , would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion . We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2018 . Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Companys net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5.1 billion and $6.4 billion , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $31 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2018 . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $206 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $35 million in pension cost. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.4 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $148 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $13 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2019 , if any, which would be made in September 2019. 52 ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

We also have audited Visa Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 , based on Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 , based on Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions Visa Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 54 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(Continued) Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2018 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization . Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada), Visa Technology  Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the worlds largest retail electronic payments network  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visas financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Companys investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Companys activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 3Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. 63 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Companys Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Companys Level 3 assets include non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Companys employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Companys operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 3Fair Value Measurements and Investments . 64 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Companys financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Companys rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding certain cash collateral for which clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Companys name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 8Settlement Guarantee Management . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technologys estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 4Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. 65 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2018 . See Note 5Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2018 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2018 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of February 1, 2018 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2018 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Companys defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Companys estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 17Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Companys operating revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Companys clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 66 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Companys acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe, other revenues also included revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visas network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Companys income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 16Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 11 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. 67 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 7Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Companys functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2018, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Companys euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on managements best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 13Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 12Earnings Per Share . 68 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The new standard will primarily impact the timing of recognition and classification of certain client incentives, including certain services provided as an incentive, and certain marketing-related funds paid to customers. The Company has completed an assessment of its existing customer contracts through September 30, 2018. Based on this assessment, application of the new standard to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material impact. The impact of the new standard to future financial results is unknowable as it is not possible to estimate the impact of the standard to new customer contracts which may be executed in future periods. However, the new standard is not expected to have a material impact to the fiscal 2019 consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and does not anticipate that this new accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the value of leased assets and liabilities that may be recognized could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The actual impact will depend on the Companys lease portfolio at the time of adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new leases standard. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entitys reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements will continue to be in accordance with the current leases standard. The optional transition method does not change the existing disclosure requirements. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call/put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment is required to assess the embedded call/put options solely in accordance with a four-step decision sequence. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The equity method investor is required to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investors previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 69 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption will impact the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). Currently, all net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are presented in personnel expense on the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05 to insert the SECs interpretive guidance from Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 into the income tax accounting codification under U.S. GAAP. The ASU permits companies to use provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act during a one-year measurement period. The provisional accounting impacts for the Company may change in future reporting periods until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance. The standard will be effective for the Company on October 1, 2020. However, the Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and is considering early adoption of the standard. 70 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans  U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the U.S. covered litigation. These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan and consist of a U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the conversion feature of the Companys shares of class B common stock, the indemnification obligations of the Visa U.S.A. members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended. U.S. covered litigation consists of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved, as well as the following: ##TABLE_START  the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation . In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Companys IPO that has been or is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  any case brought after October 22, 2015 by a merchant that opted out of the Rule 23(b)(3) settlement class pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. See Note 17Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END U.S. litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Companys litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with the interest earned, less applicable taxes and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cashU.S. litigation escrow account by fiscal year: ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,031  $ 1,027 Deposits into the litigation escrow account   Payments to opt-out merchants and interest earned on escrow funds (1) (140 )  Balance at end of period $ 1,491  $ 1,031 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 17Legal Matters . ##TABLE_END The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. The Company recorded an additional accrual of $600 million for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2018 . No additional accrual was recorded for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2017 . See Note 17Legal Matters . 71 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 11Stockholders Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.s members for such excess amount, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 17Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of MasterCard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such banks then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation. On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with MasterCard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 17Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or MasterCard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Companys U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. 72 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a MasterCard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667% . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and MasterCard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and MasterCard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan UK loss sharing agreement. The Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition (the Closing), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of 1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory. Litigation management deed. The Company has entered into a litigation management deed with Visa Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (the VE territory covered losses) between the UKI and Europe preferred stock, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committees for VE territory covered litigation (the VE territory litigation management committees). The VE territory litigation management committees, which are composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, have also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory covered litigation. The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the UKI and Europe preferred stock, the UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visas protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation or remedies or fines imposed in competition law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plans terms. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The total amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visas class A common stock price. This amount differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders equity on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The book value of the preferred stock reflects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing. 73 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorneys fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a reduction to stockholders equity, which represents the Companys right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as right to recover for covered losses. VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than  20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in right to recover for covered losses as contra-equity will then be recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders equity. During the year ended September 30, 2018 , the Company recovered $56 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 13.077  and 13.948 , respectively, as of September 30, 2017 to 12.955 and 13.888 , respectively, as of September 30, 2018 . The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and right to recover for covered losses within equity during the year ended September 30, 2018 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs.

Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2018 . 75 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method . These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require managements judgment. When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. There were no significant impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , these investments totaled $137 million  and $94 million , respectively. These assets are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See  Note 5Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on managements judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2018 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2018 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. D ebt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Companys consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and 2017 . The fair value of these notes, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were both $16.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $18.4 billion and $19.2 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2017 . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2018 , but require disclosure of their fair values: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2018 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Investments Trading Investment Securities Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Companys employees. These investments are held in trust and are not available for the Companys operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017 , trading investment securities totaled $98 million and $82 million , respectively. 76 VISA INC.

Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Related finite-lived intangible assets recorded totaled $104 million with a weighted-average useful life of eight years . Goodwill of $181 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information related to the acquisition has not been presented as the impact is not material to the Companys financial results. The decrease in total net intangible assets and goodwill during fiscal 2018 was primarily related to foreign currency translation, which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 79 VISA INC.

Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2018. The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.5 billion . Use of Proceeds from Notes issued in 2017 . On September 11, 2017, the Company called for redemption of all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions set forth in the governing indenture. Subsequent to fiscal 2017, on October 11, 2017, the redemption date, the Company redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount. The redemption was funded with the proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017. The indenture governing the Companys outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the Notes, contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Companys existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries.  The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2018 . Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Companys option at any time at specified redemption prices. The Company recognized related interest expense of $ 550 million and $505 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 , respectively, as non-operating expense.

Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 . Credit Facility The Company is a party to a credit agreement for a 5 -year, unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on January 27, 2022 . Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable rating of senior unsecured long-term securities of the Company. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 . Note 7Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for all eligible employees residing in the United States. The Company also sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations. Disclosures presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, comprising only the Visa Europe plans. Disclosures relating to other U.S. postretirement benefit plans and other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account was credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. In October 2015, the Companys board of directors approved an amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze. As a result, a curtailment gain totaling $8 million was recognized in fiscal 2016 as part of the Companys net periodic benefit cost.  The funding policy for the U.S. pension benefits is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA. Under the Visa Europe UK pension plans, presented below under non-U.S. plans, retirement benefits are provided based on the participants final pensionable pay and are currently closed to new entrants. However, future benefits continue to accrue for active participants. The funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of the UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. 81 VISA INC.

Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances the pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with its investment strategy and within target allocation ranges. For U.S. pension plan assets, the Companys investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity securities of 50% to 80% , fixed income securities of 25% to 35% and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7% . At September 30, 2018 , U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 65% , 29% and 6% , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. For non-U.S. pension plan assets, the Companys investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity securities of 15% , interest and inflation hedging assets of 40% and other of 45% , consisting of cash, certain multi-asset funds and property. At September 30, 2018 , non-U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 16% , 38% and 46% , respectively, which were generally aligned with the target allocations. 84 VISA INC.

Cash equivalents (money market funds and time deposits), U.S. and UK Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that generally commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefit plans, to invest in portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. Although the collective investment funds held by the plan are ultimately invested in publicly traded equity securities, their own unit values are not directly observable, and therefore they are classified as Level 2. The fair values of corporate debt, multi-asset, derivatives and U.S. government-sponsored securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. 85 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2018 or 2017 . A roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were immaterial.

Personnel costs included $93 million , $58 million , and $55 million in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, for expenses attributable to the Companys employees under the 401(k) plan. The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 8Settlement Guarantee Management  The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Companys future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Companys settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Companys maximum settlement exposure was $91.7 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $56.7 billion during the year ended September 30, 2018 . 86 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2018  September 30, 2017  (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,708  $ 1,490 Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,382  1,316 Guarantees  Total $ 4,142  $ 3,914 ##TABLE_END Cash equivalent collateral reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets is held by a custodian in an account under the Companys name and ownership. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, $384 million of cash equivalent collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets as clients retain beneficial ownership of it and it is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Note 9Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments  Derivative Financial Instruments Designated derivative financial instrument hedges. The aggregate notional amount of the Companys derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program was $2.5 billion at September 30, 2018 and $1.8 billion  at  September 30, 2017 . As of September 30, 2018 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $78 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $20 million and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded from effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. Excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points were $9 million , $18 million and $30 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $71 million of pre-tax gains to earnings during fiscal 2019. Non-designated derivative financial instrument hedges . Subsequent to the acquisition of Visa Europe, the Company entered into currency forward contracts to offset Visa Europe hedges outstanding at the date of the acquisition that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the Companys accounting policy. The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency held by Visa Europe. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the aggregate notional amount of these balance sheet hedges was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. 87 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Credit and market risks. The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements, and such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2018 , the Company has received collateral of $56 million , from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and posted collateral of $2 million , which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant as of September 30, 2018 . Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge As of September 30, 2018 , the Company had designated $1.1 billion of its euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of the Companys euro-denominated net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe. During fiscal 2018 , changes in the euro exchange rate against the U.S. dollar resulted in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $0.4 billion . Note 10Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business  The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2018  September 30, 2017  (in millions) United States $ 2,152  $ 2,003 International  Total $ 2,472  $ 2,253 ##TABLE_END Revenue by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the United States were approximately 45% of net operating revenues in fiscal 2018 , 47% in fiscal 2017  and 52%  in fiscal 2016 . No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net operating revenues in these years.  A significant portion of Visas operating revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net operating revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 .  Note 11Stockholders Equity  Visa Europe acquisition. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Companys class A common stock. Additionally, Visa Europe held shares of Visa Inc.s class C common stock, which were treated as treasury stock in purchase accounting. During fiscal 2017 , the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares that were previously recorded as treasury stock. See Note 16Income Taxes As-converted class A common stock . The UKI and Europe preferred stock, issued in the Visa Europe acquisition, is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of UKI and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 88 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The number of shares of each series and class, and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2018 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1)  (in millions, except conversion rate) UKI preferred stock  12.9550  Europe preferred stock  13.8880  Class A common stock (2) 1,768    1,768 Class B common stock  1.6298 (3)  Class C common stock  4.0000  Total     2,291 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. ##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 63 million shares at an average price of $124.29 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in June 2018, the Company deposited $600 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, the Company recovered $56 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2018 . The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock, because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UKI and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following fiscal years (1) : ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     (in millions, except per share data) Shares repurchased in the open market (2)   Average repurchase price per share (3) $ 123.76  $ 89.98  $ 77.05 Total cost $ 7,192  $ 6,891  $ 6,987 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases settled during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .

Also, these exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2018 , September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END In January 2018 , the Companys board of directors authorized an additional $7.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2018 , the Companys January 2018 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through a reduction to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. 89 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account for fiscal 2018. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for as-converted class B common stock during fiscal 2017 and 2016. ##TABLE_START  For the Year Ended September 30, 2018  (in millions, except per share data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock Effective price per share (1) $ 132.32 Deposits under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Effective price per share is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Companys class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Companys current certificate of incorporation. ##TABLE_END Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table presents as-converted UKI and Europe preferred stock, after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments, for fiscal 2018 and 2017. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for UKI and Europe preferred stock during fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_START  UKI Preferred Stock  Europe Preferred Stock  For the Years Ended September 30,       (in millions, except per share and conversion rate data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock  (1)    (1)   (1)  Effective price per share (2) $ 113.05  $ 88.70  $ 112.92  $ 85.01  Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $  $  $  $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Effective price per share for each adjustment made during the year is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Companys class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Companys current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock. Effective price per share for each fiscal year is calculated using the weighted-average effective prices of the respective adjustments made during the year. ##TABLE_END Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2018 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions. A total of 140 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. 90 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had 5 million shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017 . The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the Closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the UKI or Europe preferred stock (whether by such 12th anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the holder would receive either class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Companys charter). The class A equivalent preferred stock will be freely transferable and each share of class A equivalent preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Voting rights. The holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what the Companys class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the UKI and Europe preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock. Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the class A common stockholders in a single class, and (ii) in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Companys common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends in fiscal 2018 at a quarterly rate of $0.195 per share in the first fiscal quarter and $0.21 per share in the remaining quarters of the fiscal year. On October 16, 2018 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UKI and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 4, 2018 , to all holders of record of the Companys common and preferred stock as of November 16, 2018 . Note 12Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of each class of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 11Stockholders Equity . 91 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UKI and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 403 million for fiscal 2018 , and 405 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016 . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 49 million , 58 million and 75 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million and 33 million of as-converted UKI preferred stock for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for fiscal 2018 and 2017. ##TABLE_END92 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 ##TABLE_START (3)  Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 3 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2018 , and 5 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2018 , and 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Companys UKI and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. See  Note 11Stockholders Equity . ##TABLE_ENDNote 13Share-based Compensation  2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (options), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 236 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. Awards may be granted under the plan until January 31, 2022. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. For fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $312 million , $224 million and $211 million , respectively, in personnel expense on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were $53 million , $67 million and $62 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,    Expected term (in years) (1)  4.23  4.35 Risk-free rate of return (2) 2.0 %  1.6 %  1.5 % Expected volatility (3) 18.3 %  20.2 %  21.7 % Expected dividend yield (4) 0.7 %  0.8 %  0.7 % Fair value per option granted $ 18.24  $ 13.90  $ 15.01 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Until March 2018, this assumption was based on the Companys historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believed to be generally comparable to Visa. The Companys data was weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visas IPO date as a percentage of the options contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visas data and peer data for stock options granted until March 2018 in fiscal 2018 was approximately 97% and 3% , respectively, 87% and 13% in fiscal 2017 , respectively, and 77% and 23% in fiscal 2016 , respectively. The assumptions for stock options granted after March 2018 was based on Visas historical exercise experience as the passage of time since the Companys IPO has exceeded 10 years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility. The expected volatility was approximately 18% in fiscal 2018 and 20% in fiscal 2017 and ranged from 20% to 23% in fiscal 2016 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END93 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The following table summarizes the Companys option activity for fiscal 2018 : ##TABLE_START  Options  Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at September 30, 2017 7,115,876  $ 50.17     Granted 1,646,060  $ 110.26     Forfeited (281,952 )  $ 93.19     Expired (1,128 )  $ 11.00     Exercised (2,690,016 )  $ 28.37     Outstanding at September 30, 2018 5,788,840  $ 75.30  6.94  $433 Options exercisable at September 30, 2018 3,000,704  $ 55.28  5.42  $285 Options exercisable and expected to vest at September 30, 2018 (2) 5,567,702  $ 74.23  6.86  $422 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2018 of $150.09 , less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Applies a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30, 2018 to estimate the options expected to vest in the future. ##TABLE_END For the options exercised during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the total intrinsic value was $249 million , $178 million and $103 million , respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $55 million , $62 million and $35 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2018 , there was $22 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.6 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The company discontinued granting RSAs in fiscal 2016 but will continue to grant RSUs under the EIP. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. No RSAs were granted during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $111.11 , $81.67 and $79.77 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $183 million , $163 million and $142 million , respectively. 94 VISA INC.

The performance condition is based on the Companys earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Companys total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poors 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $120.11 , $86.37 and $92.71 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 vest approximately three years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. At September 30, 2018 , there was $54 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.94 years. 95 VISA INC.

On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, the Company will pay an additional 1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. Note 15Related Parties  Visa considers an entity to be a related party for purposes of this disclosure if that entity owns more than 10% of Visas total voting common stock at the end of the fiscal year, or if an officer or employee of that entity also serves on the Companys board of directors. The Company considers an investee to be a related party if the Companys: (i) ownership interest in the investee is greater than or equal to 10% or (ii) if the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , no entity owned more than 10% of the Companys total voting common stock. There were no significant transactions with related parties during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .

The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Companys statutory federal corporate rate is a blended rate of 24.5% , which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, the Company provisionally remeasured its net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the Tax Act. The deferred tax remeasurement is now complete and resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion , recorded in fiscal 2018. 97 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 In transitioning to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act requires the Company to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in its fiscal 2018 taxable income. Such foreign earnings are subject to a one-time tax at 15.5% on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents, and at 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. The 15.5% and 8% tax, collectively referred to as the transition tax, was estimated to be $1.1 billion , and was recorded in fiscal 2018. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. The above-mentioned accounting impact of the transition tax is provisional, based on currently available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the new law. The Company continues to obtain and analyze additional information and guidance as they become available to complete the accounting for the tax impact of the Tax Act. Additional information currently unavailable that is needed to complete the analysis includes, but is not limited to, foreign tax returns and foreign tax documentation for the computation of foreign tax credits, and the final determination of the untaxed foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional accounting impact may change until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by ASU 2018-05. The Tax Act also introduces several tax provisions, including: ##TABLE_START  Tax on global intangible low-tax income, which, in general, is determined annually based on the Companys aggregate foreign subsidiaries income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. This provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. The Company needs additional information to complete its analysis on whether to adopt an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of global intangible low-tax income in the period that it is subject to such tax, or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that, upon reversal, may be subject to such tax. Hence, the Company has not recorded any tax on global intangible low-tax income in fiscal 2018. The Company will make an accounting policy election no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Base erosion and anti-abuse tax, which, in general, functions like a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions. This new minimum tax is determined on a year-by-year basis, and this provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. Hence, no base erosion anti-abuse tax has been recorded in fiscal 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income derived from serving foreign markets. This provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. Hence, the Company has not recorded the impact of this provision in fiscal 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other new tax provisions, which disallow certain deductions related to entertainment expenses, fringe benefits provided to employees, executive compensation, and fines or penalties or similar payments to governments. The Company has recorded provisional amounts for the tax effects of these new provisions in fiscal 2018, based on information currently available. The provisional amounts may change no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, if additional information is obtained and analyzed. ##TABLE_END At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , net deferred tax assets of $14 million and $81 million , respectively, are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2018 and 2017 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2018 , the Company had $17 million federal, $21 million state and $137 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2028 through 2037 . The foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. 98 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate of 24.5% to pretax income, as a result of the following: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate $ 3,141  %  $ 4,093  %  $ 2,804  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  %   %   % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit (465 )  (4 )%  (641 )  (5 )%  (553 )  (7 )% Transition tax on foreign earnings 1,147  %     %     % Remeasurement of deferred tax balances (1,133 )  (9 )%     %  (88 )  (1 )% Revaluation of Visa Europe put option    %     %  (89 )  (1 )% Reorganization of Visa Europe and other legal entities    %  1,515  %     % Other, net (386 )  (3 )%  (172 )  (2 )%  (188 )  (3 )% Income tax provision $ 2,505  %  $ 4,995  %  $ 2,021  % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective income tax rate was 20% in fiscal 2018 and 43% in fiscal 2017 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the effects of the Tax Act, which include the decrease in the fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate, the transition tax, and the remeasurement of deferred taxes, as discussed above; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements in fiscal 2018; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundations receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock. ##TABLE_END The effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016 . The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  the items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END Current income taxes receivable were $82 million and $148 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Non-current income taxes receivable of $689 million and $755 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, were included in other assets. Income taxes payable of $257 million  and $243 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, were included in accrued liabilities. Accrued income taxes of $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, were included in other liabilities. 99 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The Companys operating hub in the Asia Pacific region is located in Singapore. It is subject to a tax incentive which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive decreased Singapore tax by $295 million , $252 million and $235 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive on diluted earnings per share was $0.13 , $0.11 and $0.10 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740Income Taxes , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion are $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,353  $ 1,160 Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years  Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years (233 )  (59 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year  Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations (1 )  (1 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,658  $ 1,353 ##TABLE_ENDIt is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $15 million , $23 million and $15 million of interest expense in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued no penalties in fiscal 2018 , and accrued $1 million and $3 million of penalties in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the Company had accrued interest of $99 million and $84 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $34 million related to uncertain tax positions in its other long-term liabilities. The Companys fiscal 2012 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax return is currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. The Company has filed federal refund claims for fiscal years 2008 through 2011, which are also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claims, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2012. The Companys fiscal years 2006 through 2011 California tax returns are currently under examination. The California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Companys fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Companys fiscal 2010 through 2017 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. In April 2016, the Company petitioned the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRAs assessments. Legal proceedings continue to be in progress. The Company continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Office of the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in India completed the examination of the Companys income tax returns for the taxable years falling within the period from fiscal 2010 to 2015, and proposed certain assessments. The Company objected to these proposed assessments and filed appeals to the appellate authorities. While the timing and outcome of the final resolution of these appeals are uncertain, the Company believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its income tax obligations in India. 100 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 17Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on managements understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation by fiscal year: ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $  $ Provision for uncovered legal matters  Provision for covered legal matters  Payments for legal matters (156 )  (204 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,434  $ ##TABLE_ENDAccrual SummaryU.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation.

An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement approved by the MDL 1720 court on January 14, 2014, the Company recorded a $1.1 billion accrual to address opt-out claims for merchants who opted out of the original class settlement agreement. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, pursuant to an amended settlement agreement that superseded the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded an additional accrual and deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See further discussion below under Interchange Multidistrict Litigation  (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions and Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Accrual SummaryVE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the conversion rates applicable to the UKI preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation by fiscal year: ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $  $ Accrual for VE territory covered litigation  Payments for VE territory covered litigation (2 )  (187 ) Balance at end of period $   $ ##TABLE_ENDU.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Putative Class Actions Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or MasterCard, and in some cases, certain U.S. financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally challenged, among other things, Visas and MasterCards purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their no surcharge and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visas reorganization and IPO, under the federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the 2012 Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account and approximately $500 million attributable to interchange reductions for an eight -month period into settlement accounts established under the 2012 Settlement Agreement. 102 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Subsequently, Visa received from the Court and deposited into the Companys U.S. litigation escrow account takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion . On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower courts certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement. The Second Circuit determined that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a Damages Class and an Injunctive Relief Class. Thereafter, a new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a class action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees. That complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against: the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. The complaint names as defendants Visa Inc., MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, and certain U.S. financial institutions. In addition, the plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, seeking money damages and attorneys fees, among other relief. On September 17, 2018, Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institutions reached an agreement with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class to resolve all Damages Class claims (the Amended Settlement Agreement), subject to court approval. The Amended Settlement Agreement supersedes the 2012 Settlement Agreement and includes, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability arising out of conduct alleged by the Damages Class in the litigation, including claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement becomes final. Participating class members will not release injunctive relief claims as a named representative or non-representative class member in the putative Injunctive Relief Class. The Amended Settlement Agreement also requires an additional settlement payment from all defendants totaling $900 million , with the Companys share of $600 million to be paid from the Companys litigation escrow account established pursuant to the Companys retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The additional settlement payment will be added to the approximately $5.3 billion previously deposited into settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement. If more than 15% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class, up to $700 million may be returned to defendants (with up to $467 million to the Company) based on the total merchant opt-out percentage. Defendants may terminate the Amended Settlement Agreement if more than 25% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions Beginning in May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in or removed to various federal district courts by hundreds of merchants generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. A number of the cases also include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. In addition, some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. One merchants complaint also asserts that Visa, MasterCard and their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. On October 27, 2017, certain individual merchants filed amended complaints that, among other things, added claims for injunctive relief and updated claims for damages. In addition to the cases filed by individual merchants, Visa, MasterCard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed complaints against certain merchants in the Eastern District of New York seeking, in part, a declaration that Visas conduct did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. A number of the individual merchant actions have been settled, and remain settled. Those settled merchants are not members of the putative Damages Class for purposes of the Amended Settlement Agreement. 103 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 The individual merchant actions described in this section have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. The court has entered an order confirming that In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation , 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.), includes (1) all current and future actions transferred to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings, and (2) all actions filed in the Eastern District of New York that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. These individual merchant actions are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in the putative class actions and individual merchant actions, but the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. While the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address monetary liability in these matters, see Note 2U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , judgments or settlements that require the Company to change its business practices, rules, or contractual commitments could adversely affect the Companys financial results. VE Territory Covered Litigation UK Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 400 Merchants (the capitalized term Merchant, when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions: UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 75 Merchants, leaving more than 300 Merchants with outstanding claims. A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by only one Merchant. In judgments published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that Visas UK domestic interchange did not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to be restrictive it would not be exemptible under applicable law. In April 2018, the Court of Appeal heard the Merchants appeal of the decision alongside two separate MasterCard cases also involving interchange claims. On July 4, 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower courts rulings, finding that Visas UK domestic interchange restricted competition and the question of whether Visas UK domestic interchange was exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law had been incorrectly decided. The Court of Appeal remitted the claim to the lower court to reconsider the exemption issue and the assessment of damages. On July 31, 2018, both Visa and the Merchant applied for permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeals judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those Merchants claims. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future. The full scope of damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been served and Visa has substantial defenses. However, the total damages sought in the outstanding claims that have been issued, served and/or preserved likely amount to approximately $2 billion . 104 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Other Litigation European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. Following the issuance of a Statement of Objections in 2009 concerning, among other things, the alleged default application of Visa Inc.s inter-regional interchange fees to intra-regional and domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions in the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Commission (EC) served a Supplementary Statement of Objections (SSO) on Visa Inc. and Visa International in 2013 and a revised SSO in August 2017. The revised SSO concerns only the application of Visa Inc.s inter-regional interchange fees to transactions involving Visa consumer debit and credit cards issued outside of the Visa Europe region and used at merchants located within the EEA. The EC continues to claim that inter-regional interchange fees violate EEA competition law and may impose fines in the event that it adopts an infringement decision. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. The EC may also require Visa to reduce the default inter-regional interchange rates the Company sets, revise the Visa operating rules or the way in which the Company enforces its rules, or otherwise modify the way the Company does business. Visa responded in writing to the revised SSO in November 2017 and an oral hearing was held in February 2018. Visa continues to cooperate with the EC in its investigation. All issues relating to intra-regional or domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions acquired in the EEA were settled by commitments offered by Visa Europe Limited in 2010 and 2014 respectively, and endorsed by the EC. Those commitments have now expired, but the European Union rates on which those commitments were applied remain subject to limits imposed by the European Interchange Fee Regulation. DCC Investigation. In 2013, the EC opened an investigation against Visa Europe, based on a complaint alleging that Visa Europes pricing of and rules relating to Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) transactions infringe EU competition rules. This investigation is pending. Canadian Merchant Litigation Beginning in December 2010, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta against Visa Canada, MasterCard and ten financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept payment by Visa and/or MasterCard credit cards. The actions allege a violation of Canadas price-fixing law and various common law claims based on separate Visa and MasterCard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the networks rules. In 2015 and 2016, four financial institutions settled with the plaintiffs. In June 2017, Visa, MasterCard and a fifth financial institution also reached settlements with the plaintiffs. Settlement approval hearings were held in 2018 and courts in each of the five provinces approved the settlements. Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. have filed notices of appeal of the British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta decisions approving the settlements. U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Plus System, Inc.) and MasterCard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visas rule (and a similar MasterCard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and MasterCard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, MasterCard and three financial institutions as defendants. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. These cases are proceeding in the district court. 105 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the Division) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visas competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visas fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Pulse Network On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has, among other things, monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys fees and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visas conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On August 31, 2018, the court granted Visas motion for summary judgment, finding that Pulse did not have standing to pursue its claims. On September 28, 2018, Pulse filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the district courts summary judgment decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. EMV Chip Liability Shift Following their initial complaint filed on March 8, 2016, BR Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milams Market, and Grove Liquors LLC filed an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., MasterCard, Discover, American Express, EMVCo and certain financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended complaint asserts that defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty or otherwise rejected payment card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, defined as those merchants throughout the United States who have been subjected to the Liability Shift since October 2015. Plaintiffs claim that the so-called Liability Shift violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. EMVCo and the financial institution defendants were dismissed, and the matter was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which has clarified that this case is not part of MDL 1720. Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification on July 16, 2018, following an earlier denial of the motion without prejudice. Kroger On June 27, 2016, The Kroger Co. (Kroger) filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. After granting a motion to dismiss filed by Visa, Kroger filed an amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that certain of its actions or policies with respect to its acceptance of Visa debit cards did not violate a commercial agreement between Kroger and Visa, and seeking monetary damages under state law. On November 13, 2017, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and Kroger subsequently sought leave to file a second amended complaint. The parties have stipulated that the litigation, including consideration of that motion, be stayed until December 4, 2018. Nuts for Candy On April 5, 2017, plaintiff Nuts for Candy, on behalf of itself and a putative class of California merchants that have accepted Visa-branded cards since January 1, 2004, filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa U.S.A. in California state court. Nuts for Candy pursues claims under California state antitrust and unfair business statutes, seeking damages, costs and other remedies. Subject to the courts approval, Visa and Nuts for Candy have reached an agreement to resolve Nuts for Candys claims in connection with the settlement of the putative Damages Class claims discussed above in Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Putative Class Actions . 106 VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2018 Korea Fair Trade Commission Following complaints lodged by certain financial institutions in Korea, in November 2016, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) initiated an investigation into certain pricing changes applicable to Visa financial institutions in Korea. In August 2018, the KFTC notified Visa that the KFTC determined that the pricing changes did not violate Korean law and the investigation was closed. Ohio Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand On January 19, 2017, the State of Ohio Office of the Attorney General issued an investigative demand to Visa seeking documents and information focusing on Visas rules related to the acceptance of Visa debit cards, as well as cardholder verification methods and the routing of Visa debit transactions. Visa is cooperating with the Attorney General. Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense On October 15, 2018, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) initiated an investigation against Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Elo seeking information regarding potential competition law violations with respect to network rules that require acquirers to receive certain information from payment facilitators. Visa is cooperating with CADE. 107 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) The following tables show selected quarterly operating results for each quarter and full year of fiscal 2018 and 2017 for the Company:  ##TABLE_START  Quarter Ended (unaudited)  Fiscal Year Visa Inc.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2018 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2018 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2018 , there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2018 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Business OVERVIEW Visa is the worlds leader in digital payments. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payments network  enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. We facilitate commerce across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Since Visas inception in 1958, Visa has been in the business of facilitating payments between consumers and businesses. With new ways to pay, we are evolving into a company that enables money movement for everyone, everywhere. To accomplish this, we are continually focused on extending, enhancing and investing in our proprietary network, VisaNet, while seeking new ways to offer products and services and become a single connection point for initiating any transaction, both on the Visa network and beyond. This has enabled Visa to become one of the worlds largest electronic payments networks based on payments volume and number of transactions. Our fundamental business model is based on the following: ##TABLE_START  We facilitate secure, reliable and convenient transactions between financial institutions, merchants and account holders. We traditionally have referred to this as the four party model. As the payments ecosystem continues to evolve, we are continuing to broaden this model to include digital banks, wallets and a range of financial technology companies (fintechs), governments and non-governmental organizations. We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our global processing platform. During fiscal year 2019, we saw 201.9 billion payments and cash transactions with Visas brand, equating to an average of 553 million transactions a day. Of the 201.9 billion total transactions, 138.3 billion were processed by Visa. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our 15,500 financial institution clients use to develop and offer core business solutions, including credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for individual, business and government account holders. During fiscal year 2019, Visas total payments and cash volume grew to $11.6 trillion and more than 3.4 billion cards were available worldwide to be used at more than 61 million merchant locations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We take an open, partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our global network, including offering our technology capabilities through application programming interfaces (APIs). Additionally, we enter into partnerships with both traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand the payments ecosystem. This approach helps our partners leverage the resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses more quickly and effectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We are accelerating the migration to digital payments by enabling new types of transactions beyond the core consumer-to-business (C2B) payments. These include person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We provide value-added services to our clients, including consulting and analytics, fraud management and security services, merchant solutions, processing capabilities and digital services like tokenization. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We invest in and promote our brand to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, and the National Football League, among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations. ##TABLE_ENDFISCAL YEAR 2019 KEY STATISTICS ##TABLE_START (1) Please see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results. ##TABLE_END Revenue Details Net revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues minus costs incurred under client incentive arrangements. We have one reportable segment, which is Payment Services. (1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. (2) Please see Note 3Revenues t o our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for the impact of the new revenue standard. Visa earns revenue by facilitating commerce across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Visa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. That is the role of our financial institution clients. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our open-loop payments network. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees. In addition, we do not receive as revenue the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by their acquirers. ACCELERATING OUR BUSINESS: FISCAL YEAR 2019 KEY FOCUS AREAS As technology evolves from wired to wireless solutions  driven by technology developments such as the expansion of mobile technology and the rise of 5G networks  there are significant opportunities to grow digital payments. To capture this growth, we are strengthening our core business while simultaneously evolving our organization to seize opportunities to open new payment flows, expand access, build our acceptance footprint and grow our base of partners and clients. We are also building and acquiring new capabilities that can add value to our clients as we strengthen the foundation of our business: technology, security, brand and talent. Core Business For decades, Visas growth has been driven by the strength of our core business solutions  credit, debit and prepaid products  as well as our global ATM network. As the pace of change accelerates each year, helped by the advancement of technology and our focus on the user experience in payments, we see significant opportunity for continued growth. We are accelerating efforts to move approximately $17 trillion in consumer spending and $15-20 trillion of B2B spending still done in cash and check to cards and digital credentials on the Visa network. 1. Core Products Business Solutions: We offer a portfolio of business payment solutions, including small business, corporate (travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual cards/digital credentials, non-card cross-border B2B payment options and disbursement accounts, covering most major industry segments around the world. Business solutions are designed to bring efficiency, controls and automation to small businesses, commercial and government payment processes, ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables. Credit: Credit cards and digital credentials are issued by financial institutions and used by co-brand partners and fintechs to allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services. Visa does not extend credit to account holders; however, we provide card benefits, including technology, authorization, fraud tools and brand support that issuers use to enable their credit products. We also work with our clients on product design, consumer segmentation and consumer experience design to help our clients deliver products and services that match their consumers needs. Debit: Debit cards and digital credentials are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their bank accounts. Debit cards enable account holders to transact  in person, online or via mobile  without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. Visa provides a strong brand, the network infrastructure (which includes processing, acceptance, product features and support, risk tools and services) and industry expertise to help issuers optimize their debit offerings. Prepaid: Prepaid products draw from a designated balance funded by individuals, businesses or governments. Prepaid cards address many use cases and needs, including general purpose reloadable, payroll, government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift and travel. Prepaid cards also play an important part in financial inclusion, bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products. Global ATM: The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network provides account holders with cash access in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent ATM operators. Tap to Pay Contactless payments  or when a consumer taps to pay at checkout with a contactless card or mobile phone  continues to see strong adoption around the world. In 2019, excluding the United States (U.S.), tap to pay had surpassed 50 percent of face-to-face transactions that ran over the Visa network. This is up from less than 30 percent just two years ago. There are now more than 50 countries where tapping to pay represents at least a third of all domestic face-to-face transactions processed on our network, up from 35 countries at the end of last fiscal year. The U.S. is starting to catch up to this global adoption rate. In 2019, U.S. financial institutions began issuing contactless cards to customers nationwide. There are now more than 100 million Visa contactless cards in the U.S., and we expect that number to grow to 300 million by the end of 2020. Contactless payments can also open up new payment experiences, such as transit. Transit continues to be an important use case for introducing consumers to the benefits of tapping to pay. In 2019, Visa helped launch contactless transit solutions in cities around the world, including Belarus, Edinburgh, Florence, Manchester, Miami, Milan, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, So Paulo and more  making it easier for people to get around while reducing operating costs for private and public transport operators. Ecommerce Ecommerce has drastically evolved since the first online purchase was made on the Visa network 25 years ago. Digital commerce growth is outpacing physical retail growth, and we expect this to continue. This presents an opportunity to evolve both the security and consumer experience around ecommerce. As a result, we are helping to transform the digital checkout experience by adding more security and removing friction with the launch of click to pay. Enabled by the EMV Secure Remote Commerce Specifications, click to pay simplifies the checkout experience, eliminating the need for a consumer to enter payment details each time they are purchasing digital services or shopping online. This means greater consistency and fewer steps at checkout, regardless of ones payment choice. In October 2019, click to pay went live with select merchants in the U.S., and we expect full commercial migration of Visa Checkout to happen in early 2020. Consumers can click to pay with confidence when they see a common checkout button with network logos and a stylized depiction of a fast forward icon . (1)  ##TABLE_START (1) The SRC payment icon is available for use in connection with implementations of the EMV Secure Remote Commerce Specification. The SRC payment icon image files are provided following execution of the EMVCo Trademark License Agreement for SRC Payment Icon and may only be used in conformance with the Secure Remote Commerce (SRC): Payment Icon Reproduction Requirements. ##TABLE_ENDGrowing Access and Acceptance A key component of how we expand our business focuses on growing access and increasing acceptance of our products around the world. Mobile connectivity, new acceptance devices untethered to landline infrastructure and new partnerships are enabling Visa payments in categories where card acceptance has typically been low, such as rent, parking and vending machines. We accomplish this in a few ways: Drive new acceptance categories to uncover additional growth . We continue to expand our acceptance footprint in both mature and emerging markets, and we remain committed to growing access and acceptance so that businesses and devices are enabled to send and receive funds via the Visa network. For example, Visa has grown acceptance in the U.S. vending machine category by enabling more than two million devices as new acceptance locations, which still leaves an estimated 50 percent of vending machines available for upgrade. Street parking represents a similar opportunity. Ensuring seamless experiences for cross-border transactions. As commerce continues to flow across borders, we are simplifying and streamlining how funds flow for both consumers and businesses. Cross-border ecommerce is also a growing opportunity. Consumers purchasing something from a foreign website are expected to account for $900 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2020, representing an estimated 22 percent share of the global ecommerce market. (2)  Enhancing inclusive financial access . According to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people worldwide still lack access to formal financial services, which means they do not have access to the services that can help facilitate the growth of their economic livelihood. As part of the World Banks goal of Universal Financial Access by 2020, in 2015 we committed to reaching 500 million consumers by 2020. At the end of 2018, we reached 396 million consumers worldwide with first-time access to a digital payment product through a Visa-branded account in partnership with local financial institutions. Our scan to pay service has emerged as one of our most successful low-cost acceptance solutions for merchants, enabling the growth of digital payments in developing economies and remote locations. In some countries, the infrastructure for traditional payments technology simply may not exist. With scan to pay, a business needs only to display a QR code to accept digital payments, saving the cost, time and complexity of installing a terminal and telecommunications wiring. Scan to pay is already live in parts of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, with plans to expand into emerging markets of all sizes and regions. In India, we continue to work with local acquirers to expand access and strengthen consumer demand for electronic payments. The total acceptance points in India have expanded to more than five million, including more than one million QR points this year. In Mexico, we are executing a program to grow the penetration of electronic payments, supporting the introduction of mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) and new acceptance technologies through our payment facilitator and acquirer partners. Our social impact work also supports womens empowerment and the expansion of financial inclusion through programs that support skill-development and access to networks and financial services for under and unbanked populations. In January 2019, we launched Shes Next, Empowered by Visa, which connects women business owners to their communities, funding options and payment technologies through workshops, training and mentorship. To date, Visa has signed up and hosted women entrepreneurs at workshops across North America, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York City, Toronto and Washington D.C. Open Partnership Model For more than 60 years, mutually beneficial partnerships have been fundamental to Visas business model. We traditionally have operated in a four-party model, facilitating transactions between issuers, acquirers, merchants and account holders. As the payment ecosystem grows, so too does Visas partnership model. Today, our partnerships extend to technology companies, fintechs, governments and non-governmental organizations. ##TABLE_START (2) _ http://www.ipc.be/services/markets-and-regulations/e-commerce-market-insights/e-commerce-articles/global-ecommercefigures-2017#infographic ##TABLE_ENDFintechs continue to be key enablers around the world in helping to expand access through electronic payments, open new points of acceptance, drive new payment flows and create new ways to pay and be paid. Visa has the ability to help these companies grow and scale their payment innovations around the world, with increased safety and speed. Visa is continuing to increase its reach and scope to address fintech needs by partnering directly with them and with the platforms that service them around the world. We are designing Visa services to more efficiently meet our partners needs. Visa Fintech Fast Track, a program that enables nimble start-ups to more easily scale and leverage the reach, capabilities and security Visa offers, is now available to clients globally. Additionally, the new Visa Partner portal provides comprehensive services and resources  everything from information about API services to how to think about issuer processing  to help fintechs and all of our ecosystem partners bring new ways to pay to life. Ventures Visa continues to make strategic investments in some companies that are enriching the broader payments ecosystem. Through these strategic investments, Visa seeks to promote complementary, value-added services, enable new use cases, and expand the distribution and utility of our payments network. 2. New Payment Flows Over the last several years, Visa has invested in expanding beyond C2B payments to capture growth in new payment flows such as P2P, B2C, B2B and G2C payments. Today, partners are increasingly using Visas network infrastructure and capabilities to enable Visa to unlock a growing market opportunity. Visa Direct Visa Direct continues to be one of the most meaningful ways in which we are capturing new types of payments that were previously made by cash, check or Account Clearing House (ACH). Visa Direct, Visas real-time (3 ) push payments service, reverses the traditional card payment flow by allowing payment originators, through their acquirer, to push funds directly to cards, better meeting consumer and business needs. For example, a ride sharing company can pay its drivers after a shift by transferring their pay directly to a Visa product. Visa Direct helps enable domestic and cross-border payouts for consumers and small businesses in more than 170 countries. Its capabilities modernize money movement, offering enhanced choice and convenience in how money is sent and received. We have announced several Visa Direct partnerships that have helped drive transaction growth to more than 100 percent year-over-year growth this year. ##TABLE_START (3)  Actual fund availability depends on receiving financial institution and region. Visa requires fast-funds enabled issuers to make funds available to their recipient account holders within a maximum of 30 minutes of approving the transaction. ##TABLE_ENDToday, Visa Direct powers seven of the major P2P platforms in the U.S. In the last year, Visa Direct transactions have been sent from 90 countries to the more than 170 countries where Visa Direct is currently available. Cross-border payments have continued to be a focal point for Visa Direct, with key partnerships announced throughout the year. With Visa Direct, Visa is extending the reach and capabilities of our global network to create a payment solution that is less constrained by time, borders or networks. Earthport In July 2019, Visa acquired Earthport, which provides cross-border payment services to banks, money transfer service providers and businesses via one of the worlds largest independent ACH networks. Before Earthport, Visa could reach about half of the worlds bank accounts, accessing them using Visa Direct and sending money to Visa credentials, such as debit or credit cards. Through a combination of the existing Visa network and the addition of the Earthport network, Visa clients will soon be able to push payments to the majority of the worlds banked population, reaching more than 99 percent of bank accounts in 88 countries, including the top 50 markets. Our vision is to enable our clients to reach bank accounts of consumers and small businesses in almost 200 countries via a single connection. Integration efforts are underway, and we expect to launch a pilot of our first fully integrated Visa Direct and Earthport experience by the end of the 2019 calendar year. B2B We are also extending our network with B2B payments. Businesses spend an estimated $120 trillion each year, offering tremendous room for us to continue to grow our business. Our strategy is two-fold: invest in and grow our existing commercial card solutions and capture new payment flows by innovating in the non-card payments space. Our existing commercial card solutions generated more than $1 trillion in payments volume in fiscal year 2019, making Visa the largest card payment network for B2B payments in the world. We continue to invest across our small business, travel and entertainment, purchasing, fleet and virtual card solutions to further digitize how businesses pay other businesses. In 2019, we commercially launched Visa B2B Connect, a multilateral network that operates separately from VisaNet and facilitates B2B cross-border transactions directly from an originating bank to the recipient bank. This network gives financial institutions the ability to quickly and securely process high-value corporate cross-border payments globally and helps simplify and speed up the way businesses pay other businesses around the world. Visa B2B Connects current reach includes more than 60 countries with the goal to expand to more than 100 countries in 2020. We are actively working with strategic partners and clients to increase the adoption of electronic payments in the accounts receivable and accounts payable space across large and medium-sized markets, as well as the small business category in key areas such as bill payment. 3. Value-Added Services As the payments category expands, both in scope and size, there is a growing opportunity to broaden our revenue streams by expanding the capabilities of our existing network in addition to selectively offering our services to other payment providers. We are accomplishing this through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions. Today, we offer several enhanced capabilities and services, including fraud prevention and security, processing, loyalty, merchant and digital solutions, consulting and data solutions. Visa Consulting and Analytics Visa Consulting and Analytics is the payments consulting advisory arm of Visa. This group is a client-facing global team of several hundred payments consultants, data scientists and economists across six continents. The combination of our deep payments expertise, our breadth of data and our economic intelligence allows us to identify actionable insights, recommendations and solutions that drive better business decisions and outcomes for clients. Fraud Management and Security Services  Trust is at the core of Visa. Through an evolving and multilayered approach, Visa strives to expect the unexpected, constantly monitoring our network and sharing intelligence with our partners. Our multi-prong security strategy is based on empowering consumers and clients through tools, resources and controls so that others can make more informed risk decisions. To provide these tools, we invest in intelligence and technologies that improve fraud and authorization performance. Visa Advanced Authorization risk scores every Visa-processed transaction in about one millisecond, an average of 379 million times a day. In the last year, Visas artificial intelligence-powered risk scoring engine helped financial institutions prevent about $25 billion in fraud. We believe security is an integral driver for growth and innovation. Several developments over the course of 2019 help demonstrate our approach: ##TABLE_START  We continued to see the benefits of chip technology in preventing counterfeit fraud and reducing the amount and rate of fraud taking place in-person at physical stores. In the U.S., for example, our most recent data shows an 87 percent decline in counterfeit fraud at chip-enabled merchants since 2015, when the industry began to deploy chip technology. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  EMV 3-D Secure (3DS) is a new generation of the protocol  developed by Visa, other payment brands and industry participants as part of EMVCo  and is designed to protect accounts from unauthorized use across desktop, laptop, mobile or other connected devices, making online purchases easier and more secure. In 2019, Visa branded its 3DS program as Visa Secure (formerly Verified by Visa). The Visa Secure visual badge, combined with descriptive language emphasizing, Your online transactions are secure with Visa, will be the way consumers encounter Visas 3DS offering. ##TABLE_END Visa is also committed to helping protect the broader payments ecosystem from growing cyber threats through continued investments in intelligence and technology. Companies today must be responsible for securing their businesses from increasingly sophisticated tactics by cyber criminals. Visa provides a suite of capabilities that are a core benefit of being part of the Visa network. Our security capabilities help protect the integrity of the payments ecosystem by seeking to detect and disrupt fraud threats targeting financial institutions and merchants. We combine payment and cyber intelligence, insights and learnings from client/partner breach investigations and law enforcement engagement to help financial institutions and merchants solve critical security challenges. Visa Token Service Visa Token Service creates a secure environment to help drive innovation in online and mobile commerce. The technology works by replacing a consumers card-related sensitive information, such as personal account number, with a unique identifier, or token , which protects transactions in a number of ways, including when a card or shopper is not physically present. Launched in 2014, tokenization has been brought to scale over the last five years. Visa Token Service is available in more than 100 markets. In October 2019, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing businesses of Rambus Inc. The combination of Visas card network tokenization capabilities with the local and account tokenization technology of Rambus will facilitate safer, more secure payments across a broader range of global commerce types. Merchant and Acquirer Solutions CyberSources product offerings are examples of Visas continued investment to deliver industry-leading products and capabilities to our merchant and acquirer partners. The CyberSource platform enables merchants to accept payments online, in-app or on the mobile web and in-person. CyberSources small business solutions are represented by the Authorize.Net brand in North America. CyberSource provides modular, digital capabilities beyond the traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing. As part of CyberSource's solution to acquirers, we are enabling acquirers to leverage our capabilities to drive more innovation in the payments ecosystem. Using CyberSource services, merchants of all sizes can improve the way their consumers engage and transact, mitigate fraud and security risk, lower operational costs and adapt to changing business requirements. CyberSources global footprint lets merchants accept payments in more than 190 countries and territories around the world and includes a broad choice of acquirer and processor partners, payment types and hardware components. This year, we announced the acquisition of Payworks, a point-of-sale software solution that enables acquirers to support merchant terminal payments via the cloud, helping merchants seamlessly and quickly implement new functionality, designed to create better customer experiences and lower merchant operating costs. Payworks will add in-store payment processing capabilities to CyberSource's ecommerce payment platform to create a fully integrated omni-channel payment acceptance solution. Visa also completed the acquisition of Verifi, a leader in technology solutions to reduce chargebacks. Verifis technology enables the quick resolution of disputes by connecting issuers to the data of more than 25,000 merchants as soon as an account holder calls with an issue. This tool reduces costs and time spent for all stakeholders in a disputed transaction. 4. Foundational The foundations of our business are our technology, security, brand and talent. Technology Visas technology platform consists of software, hardware, data centers and a vast telecommunications infrastructure, each with a distinct architecture and operational footprint wrapped with several layers of security and protection technologies. Together, these systems deliver the secure, convenient and reliable service that our clients and consumers expect of the Visa brand. Software As part of our global technology environment, we build and securely operate hundreds of commercial applications using a diverse set of technologies.  Our software powers the core functions of our transaction processing  including authorization, clearing and settlement, and risk scoring  as well as all of our value-added services. These applications together work to provide essential services to the payments ecosystem. Hardware We rely on a diverse array of sophisticated infrastructure systems that are tailored to our services. Visa's infrastructure is designed and configured with layers of redundancies. We have multiple instances of our software running on separate pieces of hardware, which is designed to provide continuous availability. Our disaster recovery capabilities are tiered so that our real-time transaction processing services can be continuously available. Data Centers Visa operates six data centers that are a critical part of our global processing environment and are built with the capacity to support Visas growing power, cooling and space needs. All of our data centers have high redundancy of network connectivity, power and cooling designed to provide continuous availability of systems. We are continuing to reduce the carbon footprint of our data centers by deploying efficiency improvement strategies, including LED lighting, variable airflow automation controls and hot-and-cold air containment technologies. Telecommunications  We connect our clients and partners to Visas data centers through a massive telecommunications network covering more than 10 million route miles. Each network node is connected through redundant links, designed to provide high levels of security, availability and performance for our products and services. Security In parallel with our role in advancing the security of the broader payments ecosystem, Visa remains committed to championing cybersecurity. Our multifaceted security approach includes deploying security tools that help keep our clients and consumers safe, while providing solutions that make Visa the best way to pay and be paid. We invest significantly in our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity at Visa. We deploy security technologies to protect against data confidentiality, integrity and availability risks, emphasizing core cybersecurity capabilities to minimize risk exposure. Our in-depth security approach applies multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of any single control failing. These measures include the following: ##TABLE_START  A formal program to devalue sensitive and/or personal data through various cryptographic means ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Embedded security in the software development lifecycle ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Identity and access management controls to protect against unauthorized access ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Development of advanced cyber detection and response capabilities ##TABLE_END For example, Visa uses AI and deep learning technology to monitor our network and understand the threats aimed at our company. Our platform collects billions of security logs each day, providing insight across the network and within our infrastructure. We combine this data with external intelligence on attacks observed outside of our data centers and network. Using machine learning tools, we focus on the events that appear to pose a risk, enabling our cybersecurity team to intervene. We operate this platform globally, with teams in multiple time zones detecting and responding 24x7x365. Brand The Visa brand is one of the worlds most recognized, trusted and valuable brands. Anchored on the notion that Visa is Everywhere You Want To Be, the Visa brand stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability. In recognition of its strength among clients and consumers, the Visa brand consistently ranks highly in multiple brand studies, including #1 on Forbes Worlds Best Regarded Companies (2019), #5 on BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands (2019), Forbes Worlds Most Valuable Brands and Interbrands Best Global Brands, among others. Our brand strength helps us to deliver added value to financial institutions, merchants, clients and partners through compelling brand expressions, a wide-range of products and services and innovative marketing efforts. In a consumer study by Visa in 16 countries, when consumers see the Visa logo, they are 3.5 times more likely to think the website is more secure. In fiscal year 2019, we renewed our 25-year relationship with the National Football League, and continued our global sponsorship of FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee. Visa is the only brand in the world that is a top sponsor of these properties, and is also the largest sponsor of womens football in the world. At the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, this opportunity will be on full display when we will use our brand and technology to bring Japans vision for a future of digital payments to life. Talent Visas workforce continues to grow, increasing from approximately 17,000 employees in fiscal year 2018 to 19,500 employees in fiscal year 2019. This growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions, with growth in the regions outpacing growth in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the end of fiscal year 2019, Visas global workforce was 59 percent male and 41 percent female. Increasing the representation of women and under-represented minorities remain an area of focus for management. Visas commitment to diversity recruiting includes partnering with organizations such as AfroTech, AnitaB.org, Catalyst, Diversity Best Practices, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Watermark - Silicon Valley Conference for Women, Women in CyberSecurity, Women in Payments and many others to support and develop a diverse talent pipeline. Visa is committed to pay equity for employees doing similar work, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and conducts pay equity analyses on an annual basis. We assess employee engagement through our annual employee survey, which provides feedback on a variety of topics, such as company direction and strategy, diversity and inclusion, individual development, collaboration and trust. For the second year in a row, we had an exceptional response rate of 95 percent with improvement in the survey results across the board and no items with notably declining scores. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability. Our portfolio of Visa-owned trademarks are important to our business. Generally, trademark registrations are valid indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or maintained. We give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers, which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. COMPETITION The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with Visas network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants. Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete, creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition. We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include: Global or Multi-Regional Networks : These networks typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB and UnionPay. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the U.S., or have a leading position in certain countries. For example, UnionPay operates the sole domestic card acceptance mark in China and is expanding into other global markets. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Regulatory Risks  Government-imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia . Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world. The following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2018 (4) : ##TABLE_START  Visa  Mastercard  American Express  JCB  Diners Club Payments Volume ($B) 8,449  4,338  1,169   Total Volume ($B) 11,380  5,901  1,184   Total Transactions (B)     Cards (M) 3,359  2,022    ##TABLE_END(4) MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1154 (May 2019). Mastercard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express, Diners Club/Discover, and JCB include business from third-party issuers. JCB figures include other payment-related products and some figures are estimates. Local and Regional Networks : Operated in many countries, these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions. These networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the U.S., Interac in Canada, EFTPOS in Australia and Mir in Russia. Alternate Payment Providers : These providers often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels, but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities are both a partner and a competitor to Visa. ACH and Real Time Payment (RTP) Networks : These networks are often governed by local regulations. Primarily focused on interbank transfers, many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments. We also compete with closed-loop payment systems, emerging payments networks, wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers. Payment Processors : We compete with payment processors for the processing of Visa transactions. These processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors and other third-parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage. We succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, governments, non-governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively due to our global brand, our broad set of Visa-branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through VisaNet. SEASONALITY We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018 accounted for more than 30 percent of our net revenues in those years. WORKING CAPITAL Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. GOVERNMENT REGULATION As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A-Risk Factors-Regulatory Risks . Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are included on OFACs list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in transactions using our services. Government-Imposed Market Participation and Restrictions: Certain governments, including China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam, have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization or mandate domestic processing be done in that country. Interchange Rates and Fees: An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the U.S. limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions, the European Unions (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in Europe (as discussed below) and the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Central Bank of Brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange. Internet Transactions: Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol. Network Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFRs prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card. No-surcharge Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation. Privacy and Data Protection: Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data-handling practices, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry: Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to U.S. financial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the FFIEC are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. Visa also may be separately examined by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries/regions, including Europe, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong. European Regulations and Supervisory Oversight: Visa in Europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the European Economic Area (EEA). Visa Europe is designated as a Recognized Payment System in the United Kingdom, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of Englands supervisory powers and subject to various requirements, including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the United Kingdoms financial system. Visa Europe is also subject to the European Central Banks oversight, whose main focus is on the smooth operation of payment systems in the Euro area, including the security, operational reliability, and business continuity of the payment systems. Furthermore, Visa Europe is regulated by the United Kingdoms Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the United Kingdom, and ensuring payments meet account holder needs. The PSR is also the regulator responsible for monitoring Visa Europes compliance with the IFR in the United Kingdom. The IFR regulates interchange rates within Europe, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting, organization, and decision-making purposes within the EU and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in the EU are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in their markets. There are other regulations in the European Union that impact our business, as discussed above, including privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other recent regulatory changes in Europe, such as the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), require, among other things, that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non-financial institution players. PSD2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on Visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences. As discussed in Item 1A  Risk Factors  Business Risks  The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results, Brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in Europe. Additional Regulatory Developments: Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, access rights for non-financial institutions, money transfer, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us. Furthermore, following the passage of PSD2 in Europe, several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico, are contemplating granting various types of access rights to third-party processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients, which could have implications for our business as well. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Visa Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in May 2007, and we completed our initial public offering in March 2008. Prior to 2007 when Visa was reorganized, Visa served its member financial institutions through Visa International and regional member-owned associations (e.g., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa Canada Corporation). As part of the 2007 reorganization, these associations became a part of Visa Inc. in October 2007, with the exception of Visa Europe Limited, which continued to operate as an association until our acquisition in June 2016.

Risk Factors Regulatory Risks We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results . As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. See Item 1  Business  Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, licensing requirements, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business. Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business . Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues. Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example, regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve cap the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits issuers and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. The EUs IFR places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within the EEA (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories. Furthermore, the European Commission is in the process of conducting an impact assessment of the IFR, which could potentially result in lower and/or additional interchange fee caps and restrictions. Countries in other parts of the world, including the Latin America region have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps. For example, in March 2017, Argentinas central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions. In March 2018, Brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions. When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues. In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. For example, many governments including, but not limited to governments in India and Turkey are using regulation to further drive down merchant discount rates, which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions. Some countries in Latin America, like Peru and Chile are relying on antitrust driven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate. The Payment System Regulators review of the acquiring market in the United Kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business. With increased merchant lobbying, we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees. Government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services, or to have the other networks functionality or brand marks on our products. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. For instance, new products and capabilities, including tokenization, push payments, and non-card based payment flows (e.g., B2B Connect) could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered. In addition, the European Unions requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies. We are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets, including, Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom and within the European Union. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital, or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. Increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system, including allowing non-traditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles. Finally, regulators around the world increasingly take note of each others approaches to regulating the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law, regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. For example, our settlement with the European Commission on cross-border interchange rates could draw the attention of regulators in other parts of the world. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments (or vice versa). For instance, the Reserve Bank of Australia initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well. Government-imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia . Governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks, brands, and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations. To varying degrees, these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks. In the future, public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country, which would prevent us from managing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions. In Russia, legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions. The central bank controlled national payment card system (NSPK) is the only entity allowed to process domestically. In China, UnionPay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Although we have filed an application with the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain. The approval process might require several years, and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a BCCI will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks. Recent regulatory initiatives in India also suggest growing nationalistic priorities, including a data localization mandate passed by the government, which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers. Furthermore, regional groups of countries, such as the Gulf Cooperation Countries in the Middle East and a number of countries in Southeast Asia, are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions. The African Development Bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability. Geopolitical events, including sanctions, trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities, which could adversely affect our business. Due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries (e.g., Russia and Thailand), we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively. Our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or on-shore processing. Co-badging and co-residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where Visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing. For example, in China, certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic transactions in China are processed by UnionPay and transactions outside of China are processed by us or other international payments networks. The PBOC is contemplating that dual-branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in Chinas domestic payments market. Accordingly, we have been working with Chinese issuers to issue Visa-only branded cards for international travel, and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a BCCI license. However, notwithstanding such efforts, the phase out of dual-branded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in China. Mir and UnionPay have grown rapidly in Russia and China, respectively, and are actively pursuing international expansion plans, which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule (which requires that international transactions on Visa cards be routed over VisaNet). Furthermore, although regulatory barriers shield Mir and UnionPay from competition in Russia and China, respectively, alternate payment providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce, offline, and cross-border payments, which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in China. Recently, with strong backing from Chinas government, a new digital transaction routing system known as Netlink was established. The PBOC allowed Alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in Netlink. It and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks . In general, national laws that protect domestic providers or processing may increase our costs; decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed; impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products, services and innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and create new competitors, all of which could harm our business. Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us . Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the companys location. The law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Although we have an extensive data privacy program that addresses the GDPR requirements, our ongoing efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws (such as the new California Consumer Privacy Act effective as of January 2020 and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law effective as of February 2020) may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. In addition, India has adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in India. Such data localization requirements have cost implications for us, impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network, and could affect our strategy. Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws . We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UKs HM Revenue  Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, or changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Program of Work, related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and global base-erosion proposal, may also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Litigation Risks We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place . We are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil litigants, governments, and enforcement bodies alleging, among other things, violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law, and intellectual property law (these are referred to as actions in this section). Details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive, and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages, or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements, or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, investigators, governments, or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to additional actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant. For certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent. Business Risks We face intense competition in our industry . The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers such as fintechs, and other digital payments and technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels. Our competitors may develop substantially better technology, have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources. They may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products, and services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and greater issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects. Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures, or participate in different market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological, and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit, or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternate payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Federal Reserves FedNow initiatives may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in some cases the government itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies, including mobile payments, alternate payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example: ##TABLE_START  competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or participating in alternate payment networks or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts, that could reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system; Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and the Libra Association, which seeks to launch a new stablecoin crypto-currency (Libra Coin) and global blockchain-based payments network; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  similarly, many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and real-time payment systems. To the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic transactions and/or prohibit international payment networks, like Visa, from participating on those systems, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries. Furthermore, in some regions, such as Southeast Asia, under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such domestic systems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new or revised industry standards related to EMV Secure Remote Commerce, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card Standards Group, PCI Co and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services. ##TABLE_END As the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. We may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visas proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain . Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. In order to stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts, and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits. In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business. Merchants and processors continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business . We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa products. Certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S., Canada and Europe, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory enforcement, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products. For example, in the U.S., certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact the cost of payment card acceptance. In addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and point-of-sale terminals, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process and some policymakers have concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the development of payment card standards. Additionally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business. We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties . As noted above, our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. We engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We also engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with merchants, who receive incentives from us. As emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry, we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, merchant, or digital wallet provider. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on our clients and third parties, including vendors and suppliers, to process transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to our operating rules. To the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation. Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation . Our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the point-of-sale and decrease the value of our brand. Our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including authorization, clearing and settlement service disruptions; data security breaches; compliance failures by Visa, including our employees, agents, clients, partners or suppliers; negative perception of our industry, the industries of our clients or Visa-accepting merchants; ill-perceived actions by clients, partners or other third parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, risky, controversial or illegal activities using our payment products. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, and the public, as well as impact our business. Global economic, political, market, and social events or conditions may harm our business . Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. In addition, more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the U.S. International cross-border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Therefore, adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, and natural disasters could impact our operations, our clients, our activities in a particular location, and cross-border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions. The current trade environment reduces the likelihood of having our Bank Card Clearing Institution application in China approved. In addition, any decline in cross-border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues. A decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced, value-added services from us. Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue. Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity . We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results . In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal, which was subsequently postponed until January 31, 2020. Uncertainty over the terms of the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the United Kingdom, may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the European Union and as a result, our Visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union may be impacted. In addition, applications may need to be made for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states following Brexit. These factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the European Union and United Kingdom seamlessly. This and other Brexit-related issues may require changes to our legal entity structure and/or operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could harm our business and financial results. Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth . The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies. As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. If we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth. A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business . Our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Furthermore, our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. We have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants, or third-party processors. We are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients, and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Such attacks and breaches have resulted, and may continue to result in, fraudulent activity and ultimately, financial losses to Visas clients, and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. The security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, or outage. Although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. These events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and regulatory scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through our business continuity program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise. Structural and Organizational Risks We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result . As part of our overall business strategy, we make acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: ##TABLE_START  disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and managements attention from our existing business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to develop the acquired business adequately ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired companies, or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to retain employees, clients or partners of the acquired business ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries.

The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters integrity, innovation, and collaboration could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series B and series C preferred stock into shares of class A common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class A common stock . The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Our series B and series C preferred stock will become convertible into class A common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). Conversion of our class B and class C common stock into class A common stock, or our series B and series C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class A common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class A common stockholders. Holders of our class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions . Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series B and series C preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. With respect to our series B and series C preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series B and series C preferred stock would either (i) receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common stockholders. Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control difficult . Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, except for limited exceptions: ##TABLE_START  no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders meeting and may not act by written consent ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  only the board of directors, Chairman, or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ##TABLE_END Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol V since March 19, 2008. At November 8, 2019 , we had 348 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our class A common stock is held in street name by banks and brokers. There is currently no established public trading market for our class B or C common stock. There were 1,397 and 509 holders of record of our class B and C common stock, respectively, as of November 8, 2019 . On October 22, 2019 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 3, 2019 , to holders of record as of November 15, 2019 of our common and preferred stock. Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common and preferred stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  % Change (1)     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net income, as reported $ 12,080  $ 10,301  $ 6,699  %  % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 5.32  $ 4.42  $ 2.80  %  %           Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 12,367  $ 10,729  $ 8,335  %  % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 5.44  $ 4.61  $ 3.48  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. ##TABLE_END Highlights for fiscal 2019 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $23.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , an increase of 11% over the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2019 , partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one-and-a-half percentage points . Total operating expenses for fiscal 2019 were $8.0 billion , compared to $7.7 billion in fiscal 2018 . The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing as we continue to invest in growing our business, offset by a lower litigation provision. Non-GAAP financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of our non-GAAP financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. ##TABLE_START  Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and $600 million , respectively, and related tax benefits of $83 million and $137 million , respectively, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Charitable contributions ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During fiscal 2018, we donated investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million , before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million , determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018 , in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimate of approximately $1.1 billion . See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Elimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . ##TABLE_ENDNon-GAAP operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating income (expense), income before income taxes, income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

During fiscal 2019 , we recorded an additional accrual of $370 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to U.S. covered litigation of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2019 . We also deposited $300 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2019 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 58 million shares at an average price of $154.62 per share. Of the 58 million shares, 56 million were repurchased in the open market using $8.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in September 2019, we deposited $300 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, we recovered $8 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2019 . The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UKI and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 14Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Common stock repurchases. In January 2019 , our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2019 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $4.1 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. See Note 14Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we updated our definition of payments volume to now include all disbursement volume related to Visa Direct, in addition to the funding volume previously included. All prior periods presented have been adjusted accordingly. Please refer to the Operational Performance Data section of Exhibit 99.1 on Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2019 for more details on the impact from this update in payments volume definition. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low double-digit growth in the U.S. and in line with 2018 growth. Nominal international payments volume growth of 3% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019 (1) was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 11%, respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. The following tables (2) present nominal payments and cash volume: ##TABLE_START  U.S.  International  Visa Inc.  12 months ended June 30, (1)  12 months ended June 30, (1)  12 months ended June 30, (1)    % Change    % Change    % Change  (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume                  Consumer credit $ 1,540  $ 1,441  %  $ 2,487  $ 2,457  %  $ 4,027  $ 3,898  % Consumer debit (3) 1,702  1,521  %  1,876  1,792  %  3,577  3,313  % Commercial (4)   %    %  1,015   % Total nominal payments volume $ 3,875  $ 3,527  %  $ 4,744  $ 4,612  %  $ 8,619  $ 8,139  % Cash volume   %  2,260  2,437  (7 )%  2,833  3,000  (6 )% Total nominal volume (5) $ 4,448  $ 4,089  %  $ 7,004  $ 7,049  (1 )%  $ 11,452  $ 11,139  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  U.S.  International  Visa Inc.  12 months ended June 30, (1)  12 months ended June 30, (1)  12 months ended June 30, (1)    % Change    % Change    % Change  (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume                  Consumer credit $ 1,441  $ 1,309  %  $ 2,457  $ 2,186  %  $ 3,898  $ 3,495  % Consumer debit (3) 1,521  1,379  %  1,792  1,510  %  3,313  2,888  % Commercial (4)   %    %    % Total nominal payments volume $ 3,527  $ 3,194  %  $ 4,612  $ 4,002  %  $ 8,139  $ 7,196  % Cash volume   %  2,437  2,348  %  3,000  2,892  % Total nominal volume (5) $ 4,089  $ 3,738  %  $ 7,049  $ 6,350  %  $ 11,139  $ 10,088  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following table (2) presents nominal and constant payments and cash volume growth: ##TABLE_START  International  Visa Inc.  12 months ended June 30, 2019 vs 2018 (1)  12 months ended June 30, 2018 vs 2017 (1)  12 months ended June 30, 2019 vs 2018 (1)  12 months ended June 30, 2018 vs 2017 (1)  Nominal  Constant (6)  Nominal  Constant (6)  Nominal  Constant (6)  Nominal  Constant (6) Payments volume growth                Consumer credit %  %  %  %  %  %  %  % Consumer debit (3) %  %  %  %  %  %  %  % Commercial (4) %  %  %  %  %  %  %  % Total payments volume growth %  %  %  %  %  %  %  % Cash volume growth (7 )%   %  %  %  (6 )%   %  %  % Total volume growth (1 )%  %  %  %  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter.

Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END The following table (1) provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY and PLUS cards processed on Visas networks during the fiscal periods presented: ##TABLE_START     2019 vs. 2018 % Change  2018 vs. 2017 % Change  (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 138,329  124,320  111,215  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Prior period updates are not material. ##TABLE_ENDFinancial Information Presentation Net Revenues Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our net revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarters pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volumes are transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value-added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer, or financial institution originating the transaction, is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value-added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives consist of incentives provided in contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to grow payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses consist mainly of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, indirect taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss. Non-operating Income (Expense) Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expenses. For discussion related to the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 16, 2018. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 10,279  $ 9,332  $ 8,704  $  $  %  % International 12,698  11,277  9,654  1,421  1,623  %  % Net revenues $ 22,977  $ 20,609  $ 18,358  $ 2,368  $ 2,251  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2019 reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume, and processed transactions. The increase in revenues were partially offset by increases in client incentives in fiscal 2019 . Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one-and-a-half percentage points . The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 9,700  $ 8,918  $ 7,975  $  $  %  % Data processing revenues 10,333  9,027  7,786  1,306  1,241  %  % International transaction revenues 7,804  7,211  6,321    %  % Other revenues 1,313      %  % Client incentives (6,173 )  (5,491 )  (4,565 )  (682 )  (926 )  %  % Net revenues $ 22,977  $ 20,609  $ 18,358  $ 2,368  $ 2,251  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Service revenues increased primarily due to 6% growth in nominal payments volume and select pricing modifications. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% as well as select pricing modifications. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  International transaction revenues increased primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 2% and select pricing modifications. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other revenues increased primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase in revenues from value-added services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2019 and overall growth in global payments volume. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, client incentives were also impacted by changes in classification and timing of recognition. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. ##TABLE_ENDOperating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 3,444  $ 3,170  $ 2,628  $  $  %  % Marketing 1,105      %  % Network and processing      %  % Professional fees      %  % Depreciation and amortization      %  % General and administrative 1,196  1,145  1,060    %  % Litigation provision    (207 )   (34 )%  NM Total operating expenses (2) $ 7,976  $ 7,655  $ 6,214  $  $ 1,441  %  % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Personnel expenses increased due to continued headcount growth in support of our investment strategy for future growth. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing expenses increased mainly due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain marketing expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The increase was partially offset by spend for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang and 2018 FIFA World Cup TM in fiscal 2018, which did not recur in fiscal 2019 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain general and administrative expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, higher indirect taxes, higher product enhancement costs and global facilities expansion in support of our business growth.The increase was partially offset by a $195 million charitable contribution to the Visa Foundation in fiscal 2018, which did not recur in fiscal 2019 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Litigation provision decreased primarily due to a $370 million accrual in fiscal 2019 compared to a $600 million accrual in fiscal 2018 related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_ENDNon-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  $ Change  % Change (1)     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017  (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (533 )  $ (612 )  $ (563 )  $  $ (49 )  (13 )%  % Investment income and other    (48 )   (10 )%  % Total non-operating income (expense) $ (117 )  $ (148 )  $ (450 )  $  $  (20 )%  (67 )% ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in fiscal 2019 that lowered the average cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. See Note 9Debt and Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Investment income and other decreased primarily due to gains of $193 million from the donation of investment securities to the Visa Foundation in fiscal 2018 which did not recur fiscal 2019 , offset by higher gains on our equity investments and interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_ENDEffective Income Tax Rate ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,  Change     2019 vs. 2018  2018 vs. 2017 Effective income tax rate %  %  %  (1 )%  (23 )% ##TABLE_ENDThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 primarily due to: ##TABLE_START  a decrease in federal statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act, from a blended rate of 24.5% in fiscal 2018 to a rate of 21% in fiscal 2019, as discussed below; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new provisions enacted as part of the Tax Act, including the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the absence of the following items recorded in fiscal 2018: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings in accordance with the Tax Act; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances due to the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  $161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements. ##TABLE_END The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, transitioned the U.S. tax system to a territorial system and lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% . The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate tax rate was a blended rate of 24.5%, which was reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019. The Tax Act enacted several new tax provisions effective for us on October 1, 2018, most notably FDII and GILTI. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: ##TABLE_START  provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure payments on required litigation settlements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make planned capital investments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. ##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 12,784  $ 12,941  $ 9,317 Investing activities (591 )  (3,084 )  Financing activities (12,061 )  (10,790 )  (5,924 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (277 )  (101 )  Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (145 )  $ (1,034 )  $ 4,364 ##TABLE_ENDOperating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was positively impacted by continued growth in our underlying business. Fiscal 2019 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher payments in the current year from the litigation escrow account and the first installment payment of the transition tax in connection with the Tax Act, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was lower than the prior year due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with fewer purchases, partially offset by $0.7 billion of purchase consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and $0.5 billion of purchases of other investments. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to higher class A common stock repurchases, higher dividends paid and a $1.2 billion payment of the deferred purchase consideration related to the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 14Stockholders Equity , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Foreign Earnings. Pursuant to the Tax Act, we are required to pay U.S. tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2017. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result of the Tax Act, we are no longer subject to incremental U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the U.S. Available-for-sale debt securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $4.1 billion , are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2019 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Credit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on July 25, 2024 . There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2019 . See Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2021. U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. In September 2019, we deposited $300 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2019 , was $1.2 billion and is reflected as restricted cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2019 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: ##TABLE_START  Standard and Poors  Moodys Debt type Rating  Outlook  Rating  Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1+  Stable  P-1  Stable Long-term unsecured debt AA-  Stable  Aa3  Stable ##TABLE_ENDVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2019 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $574 million. We hold approximately $7.5 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2019 , in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. On November 7, 2019, the district court held a hearing on whether to approve the Amended Settlement Agreement. We expect a decision by the district court in the first half of calendar year 2020. If approved, the final settlement amount would be approximately $5.5 billion. Our share represents approximately $3.6 billion, which would be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court. No additional funds are required for this class settlement. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out of the settlement class. Visas portion of the maximum takedown payments, which we expect to receive and is calculated to be $467 million, would be returned to our U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes paid. During September 2019, we deposited $300 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address individual claims for members who have chosen to opt out of the Amended Settlement Agreement. At September 30, 2019 , the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.2 billion . The funds in the U.S. litigation escrow account as well as the $467 million takedown payments that we expect to be returned will be available for settlement with these opt-out merchants. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when we make a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through a reduction to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The U.S. retrospective responsibility plan was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2019 , share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 58 million at an average price of $154.62 per share. Of the 58 million shares, 56 million were repurchased in the open market using $8.6 billion of cash on hand. Additionally, we deposited $300 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 14Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $8.5 billion . This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $4.1 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. See Note 14Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Dividends . During fiscal 2019 , we declared and paid $2.3 billion in dividends. On October 22, 2019 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $673 million in connection with this dividend on December 3, 2019 . See Note 14Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europes defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2019 , we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million . For Visa Europes UK pension plans, we made contributions of $10 million in fiscal 2019 , subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2020 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europes UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $10 million , respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 10Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2019 , due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we acquired businesses using $0.7 billion of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash and restricted cash received. These acquisitions will help Visas clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. In connection with our purchase of Visa Europe in June 2016, we were required to pay an additional 1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. In June 2019, we paid 1.1 billion in fulfillment of this obligation. See Note 2Acquisitions and Note 8Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Derivative Financial Instruments In fiscal 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding 3.15% Senior Notes due December 2025 that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Fair Value MeasurementsFinancial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2019 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $13.5 billion of assets and $0.2 billion of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2019 . We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years  Total  (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $  $ 4,975  $ 3,056  $ 15,332  $ 23,900 Purchase obligations (2) 1,598     3,643 Leases (3)     Transition tax (4)      Dividends (5)        Total (6),(7),(8) $ 2,951  $ 6,148  $ 3,883  $ 16,913  $ 29,895 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 9Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty-six years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes expected dividend amount of $673 million as dividends were declared on October 22, 2019 and will be paid on December 3, 2019 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 15, 2019 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6)  We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2019 . At September 30, 2019 , we had also accrued $165 million of interest and $26 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7)  We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8)  Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets or marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2019 , we have $4.1 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. ##TABLE_ENDCritical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2019 , client incentives represented 21% of gross revenues. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on managements understanding of the litigation profile, the specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ##TABLE_END Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion at September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2019 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $245 million or loss of approximately $300 million , respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2019 . The gain or loss from this hypothetical strengthening or weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain or loss on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2019 , would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1.8 billion and $5.1 billion , respectively. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $4.6 billion and $3.5 billion at September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in fair value of approximately $9 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2019 . In fiscal 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million in annual interest expense. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Pension Plan Risk At September 30, 2019 and 2018 , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $220 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $43 million in pension cost. At September 30, 2019 and 2018 , our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion , respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.5 billion at each year end. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $182 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $15 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2020 , if any, which would be made in September 2020. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ##TABLE_START    Page As of September 30, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_ENDReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Visa Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2019 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Changes in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(Continued) Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions , and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $1,203 million as of September 30, 2019. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and the amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of the legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We identified the assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also know as the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions, as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimates associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcomes could have a significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Companys litigation assessment process, including internal controls over the Companys litigation accrual process for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Companys external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Companys legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles, about the Company and its legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Companys ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. We assessed the Companys analysis of the estimated monetary exposure by checking that it included a complete population of opt-out merchants and performing sensitivity analysis over the Companys monetary exposure calculations. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(Continued) Evaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants, and strategic partners for various programs. The determination of whether incentive payments to certain strategic partners should be recorded as an operating expense or a reduction to operating revenues is dependent upon the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance within ASC Topic 606. We identified the evaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the application of the consideration payable to customer guidance due to the unique nature and complexity of the Companys open-loop payment network. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Companys revenue recognition process, including controls related to the accounting for incentive payments to strategic partners and the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance. We evaluated a sample of arrangements with certain strategic partners that participate in the Companys open-loop payment network to understand the rights and obligations of the strategic partners, and how the Company earns revenue from and incentivizes the strategic partner.

VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2019 Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada), Visa Technology  Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the worlds largest electronic payments network  VisaNet  which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visas financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Companys investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Companys activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents . Restricted cash equivalentsU.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Companys financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets include money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Companys Level 2 assets and liabilities include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, and derivative instruments. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Companys Level 3 assets include non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Companys employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Companys operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 changed the Companys accounting for marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Available-for-sale debt securities. The Companys investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Non-marketable equity securities. The Companys non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require managements judgment. Adoption of ASU 2016-01 changed the Companys accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Companys policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Companys share of each entitys profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entitys cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalentsU.S. litigation escrow, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Companys financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the Companys rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Companys name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technologys estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2019 . See Note 8Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2019 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2019 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of February 1, 2019 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2019 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Companys defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Companys estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Revenue recognition . The Companys net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payment network service provider, the Companys obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visas products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarters pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value-added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Companys clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value-added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visas network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Client incentives are accounted for as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Income taxes . The Companys income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 7 years for the U.S. plans and 10 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Companys functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations. The change in value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Companys euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on managements best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to the aggregate of all modifications for contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. See Note 3Revenues for the impact of the new revenue standard on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019 . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The following table summarizes the cumulative transition adjustments for the adoption of the new revenue standard recorded on the October 1, 2018 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the aggregate impact to all contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year 2018 Closing Balance Sheet  Cumulative Transition Adjustment for New Revenue Standard  Fiscal Year 2019 Opening Balance Sheet  (in millions) Assets  Current portion of client incentives $  $  $ Client incentives   1,152 Liabilities      Client incentives 2,834   3,075 Accrued liabilities 1,160   1,166 Deferred tax liabilities 4,618   4,726 Other liabilities 2,666   2,724 Equity      Accumulated income 11,318   11,718 ##TABLE_ENDIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for marketable equity securities and the prospective method for non-marketable equity securities. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new lease standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and expects to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method without restating comparative periods. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption impacted the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account and customer collateral on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The prior period statement of cash flows have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this ASU, which had no impact on the Companys balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of comprehensive income for any period. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. Retrospective application is required for the change in income statement presentation while the change in capitalized benefit cost is required to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented in personnel expenses while the other components are presented in other non-operating expense on the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The Company did not apply the standard retrospectively for the change in income statement presentation as the impact would have been immaterial. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which improves the financial reporting of hedging instruments to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities in its financial statements. Visa early adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05 to insert the SECs interpretive guidance from Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 into the income tax accounting codification under U.S. GAAP. The ASU permits companies to use provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act during a one-year measurement period. The Company previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, the Company adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) in the period that it is subject to such tax. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company early adopted this standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2Acquisitions In fiscal 2019 , the Company acquired several businesses for a total purchase consideration of $ 940 million , which consisted of $ 886 million in cash and $ 54 million of deferred cash consideration. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on preliminary valuations as the Company continues to gather information necessary to finalize the valuations. These preliminary values may further change in future reporting periods until finalization of the valuations, which will occur no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Goodwill of $ 643 million was recorded to reflect the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired, which represents the value that is expected from expanding the Companys product offerings and other synergies. Goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes amounts to $ 360 million . VISA INC.

The Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 370 million and $ 600 million for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See Note 20Legal Matters . Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 14Stockholders Equity . Indemnification obligations . To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.s members for such excess amounts, including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements. Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20Legal Matters . Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final judgment not allocated to the conduct of Mastercard. Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.s specified voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such banks then-current membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.s certificate of incorporation. On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as well. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that confirmed and memorialized the signatories intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20Legal Matters . Under the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333 % and a Visa portion at 66.6667 % . In addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333 % and a Visa portion at 66.6667 % . The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of the Companys U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement. On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333 % and a Visa portion at 66.6667 % . The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and Mastercard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants. Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan UK loss sharing agreement. The Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europes member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the UK LSA members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition (the Closing), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each UK LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of  1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the UKI preferred stock having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa Europe territory. Litigation management deed. The Company has entered into a litigation management deed with Visa Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (the VE territory covered losses) between the UKI and Europe preferred stock, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). The litigation management deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committees for VE territory covered litigation (the VE territory litigation management committees). The VE territory litigation management committees, which are composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, have also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory covered litigation. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the UKI and Europe preferred stock, the UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visas protection from the plan is further limited to 70 % of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation or remedies or fines imposed in competition law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plans terms. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The total amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visas class A common stock price. This amount differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders equity on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The book value of the preferred stock reflects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing. Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorneys fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a reduction to stockholders equity, which represents the Companys right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as right to recover for covered losses. VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than  20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in right to recover for covered losses as contra-equity will then be recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders equity. During the year ended September 30, 2019 , the Company recovered $ 8 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UKI and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.955 and 13.888 , respectively, as of September 30, 2018 to 12.936 and 13.884 , respectively, as of September 30, 2019 . The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and right to recover for covered losses within equity during the year ended September 30, 2019 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs.

Level 1 assets and liabilities. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Companys deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during fiscal 2019 . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company classifies U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities as available-for-sale.

The Companys non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require managements judgment. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities held as of September 30, 2019 including unrealized gains and losses since the adoption of ASU 2016-01: ##TABLE_START  For the Year Ended  September 30, 2019  (in millions) Carrying amount, beginning of period $ Adjustments related to non-marketable equity securities:  Net additions (reductions) (1) Upward adjustments Downward adjustments (2) ( 4 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Net reductions include transfers to marketable equity securities upon investments becoming a public company. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  There were no significant impairment charges of non-marketable equity securities during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . ##TABLE_END VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. See Note 8Intangible Assets and Goodwill . If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on managements judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2019 , and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at September 30, 2019 . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Investment Income Investment income is recorded as non-operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     (in millions) Interest and dividend income on cash and investments $  $  $ Realized gains (losses), net on debt securities    ( 1 ) Equity securities:      Unrealized gains (losses), net   Realized gains (losses), net from donation     Realized gains (losses), net   Investment income $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDOther Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.4 billion as of September 30, 2019 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were both $ 16.6 billion as of September 30, 2018 . Other Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2019 , but require disclosure of their fair values: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2019 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. VISA INC.

The Credit Facility is no longer governed by any financial covenants. This Credit Facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 . Note 10Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for all eligible employees residing in the U.

Disclosures presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, comprising only the Visa Europe plans. Disclosures relating to other U.S. postretirement benefit plans and other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were earned based on a cash balance formula. An employees cash balance account was credited with an amount equal to 6 % of eligible compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. In October 2015, the Companys board of directors approved an amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze.  The funding policy for the U.S. pension benefits is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution under ERISA. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Under the Visa Europe plans, retirement benefits are provided based on the participants final pensionable pay and are currently closed to new entrants. However, future benefits continue to accrue for active participants. The funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of the UK pension plans. Additional funding amounts may be agreed to with the UK pension plan trustees.

Pension plan assets are managed by external investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations. Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations are consistent with its investment strategy and within target allocation ranges. For U.S. pension plan assets, the Companys investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity securities of 50 % to 80 % , fixed income securities of 25 % to 35 % and other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 7 % . At September 30, 2019 , U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 65 % , 33 % and 2 % , respectively, which were within target allocation ranges. For non-U.S. pension plan assets, the Companys investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity securities of 15 % , interest and inflation hedging assets of 40 % and other of 45 % , consisting of cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt and asset-backed securities, multi-asset funds and property. At September 30, 2019 , non-U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 14 % , 48 % and 38 % , respectively, which generally aligned with the target allocations. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension plans investments at fair value as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , including the impact of transactions that were not settled at the end of September: ##TABLE_START  U.S. Plans  Fair Value Measurements at September 30 Using Inputs Considered as  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total          (in millions) Cash equivalents $  $          $  $ Collective investment funds     $  $       Corporate debt securities            U.S. government-sponsored debt securities            U.S. Treasury securities            Asset-backed securities         $  $   Equity securities            Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,090  $ 1,090 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-U.S. Plans  Fair Value Measurements at September 30 Using Inputs Considered as  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total          (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $  $          $  $ Corporate debt securities     $         Asset-backed securities         $  $   Equity securities            Multi-asset securities (1)      $       Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Multi-asset securities represent pension plan assets that are invested in funds comprised of broad ranges of assets. ##TABLE_END Level 1 assets. Cash equivalents (money market funds and time deposits), U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that generally commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefit plans, to invest in portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. Although the collective investment funds held by the plan are ultimately invested in publicly traded equity securities, their own unit values are not directly observable, and therefore they are classified as Level 2. The fair values of corporate debt, multi-asset, derivatives and U.S. government-sponsored securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets as provided by third-party pricing vendors. This pricing data is reviewed internally for reasonableness through comparisons with benchmark quotes from independent third-party sources. Based on this review, the valuation is confirmed or revised accordingly. Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during fiscal 2019 or 2018 . A roll-forward of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value is not presented because activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were immaterial. VISA INC.

The Companys contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred. Note 11Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Companys future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Companys settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Companys maximum settlement exposure was $ 92.0 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 57.1 billion during the year ended September 30, 2019 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At September 30, 2019 and 2018 , the Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2019  September 30, 2018  (in millions) Restricted cash equivalents $ 1,648  $ 1,708 Pledged securities at market value  Letters of credit 1,293  1,382 Guarantees  Total $ 3,677  $ 4,142 ##TABLE_END VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Note 12Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments Designated derivative financial instrument hedges. The aggregate notional amount of the Companys derivative contracts outstanding in its hedge program was $ 10.9 billion at September 30, 2019 and $ 2.5 billion at September 30, 2018 . Cash Flow Hedges As of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , the Companys cash flow hedges in an asset position totaled $ 47 million and $ 78 million , respectively, and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018 cash flow hedges in a liability position totaled $ 31 million and $ 20 million , respectively, and were classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets . See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Forward points are excluded from effectiveness testing and measurement purposes. Excluded forward points are reported in earnings. For fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the amounts by which earnings were reduced relating to excluded forward points from cash flow hedges were $ 12 million , $ 9 million and $ 18 million , respectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to that hedge is reclassified to operating revenue or expense. The Company expects to reclassify $ 22 million of pre-tax gains to earnings during fiscal 2020. Net Investment and Fair Value Hedges In fiscal 2019, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts which were designated as a net investment hedge against a portion of the Companys $ 18.8 billion net investment in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2019 . In fiscal 2019, the Company also entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of the Companys outstanding 3.15 % Senior Notes due December 2025. The Company designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. There were no swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2018 . As of September 30, 2019 , the Companys net investment hedges in an asset position totaled $ 298 million and were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and no net investment hedges were in a liability position. There were no derivative instruments designated as a net investment hedge outstanding as of September 30, 2018 . As of September 30, 2019 , the Companys fair value hedges in an asset position totaled $ 89 million and were classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while fair value hedges in a liability position totaled $ 2 million and were classified in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no fair value hedges outstanding as of September 30, 2018 . For fiscal 2019 , the Company recorded an increase in earnings of $ 95 million related to forward points and interest differentials from forward contracts and swap agreements, respectively, which are excluded from effectiveness testing. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Non-designated derivative financial instrument hedges The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , the aggregate notional amount of these balance sheet hedges was $ 0.8 billion and $ 1.2 billion , respectively. Credit and market risks. The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting agreements, and such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2019 , the Company has received collateral of $ 34 million , from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and posted collateral of $ 33 million , which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Credit and market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant as of September 30, 2019 . Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge As of September 30, 2018 , the Company had designated $ 1.1 billion of its euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate exposure of the Companys euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. In June 2019, the Company paid the deferred consideration and therefore there were no hedged non-derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2019 . Note 13Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business The Companys long-lived net property, equipment and technology assets are classified by major geographic areas as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2019  September 30, 2018  (in millions) U.S. $ 2,319  $ 2,152 International  Total $ 2,695  $ 2,472 ##TABLE_END Revenues by geographic market is primarily based on the location of the issuing financial institution. Revenues earned in the U.S. were approximately 45 % of net revenues in fiscal 2019 , 45 % in fiscal 2018 and 47 % in fiscal 2017 . No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of net revenues in these years. A significant portion of Visas net revenues is concentrated among its largest clients. Loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the Company. The Company did not have any customer that generated greater than 10% of its net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 . Note 14Stockholders Equity Visa Europe acquisition. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Companys class A common stock. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 As-converted class A common stock . The UKI and Europe preferred stock, issued in the Visa Europe acquisition, is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, at an initial conversion rate of 13.952 shares of class A common stock for each share of UKI and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The number of shares of each series and class, and the number of shares of class A common stock on an as-converted basis at September 30, 2019 and 2018 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START  September 30, 2019  September 30, 2018  Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1)  Shares Outstanding  Conversion Rate Into Class A Common Stock  As-converted Class A Common Stock (1)  (in millions, except conversion rate) UKI preferred stock  12.9360    12.9550  Europe preferred stock  13.8840    13.8880  Class A common stock (2) 1,718    1,718  1,768    1,768 Class B common stock  1.6228 (3)    1.6298 (3)  Class C common stock  4.0000    4.0000  Total     2,237      2,291 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. ##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2019 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 58 million shares at an average price of $ 154.62 per share. Of the 58 million shares, 56 million were repurchased in the open market using $ 8.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, the Company deposited $ 300 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, the Company recovered $ 8 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2019 . The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Companys class A common stock because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UKI and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The following table presents as-converted UKI and Europe preferred stock, after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,       UKI  Europe  UKI  Europe  UKI  Europe   (in millions, except per share and conversion rate data)  Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock  (1)   (1)   (1)   (1)    (1)  Effective price per share (2) $ 141.32  $ 150.26  $ 113.05  $ 112.92  $ 88.70  $ 85.01  Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $  $  $  $  $  $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Effective price per share for each adjustment made during the year is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Companys class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Companys current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock.

Also, these exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2019 , September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3)  Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. ##TABLE_END In January 2019 , the Companys board of directors authorized an additional $ 8.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2019 , the Companys January 2019 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 4.1 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through a reduction to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The following table presents as-converted class B common stock after deposits into the litigation escrow account for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . There were no comparable adjustments recorded for as-converted class B common stock for fiscal 2017 . ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,    (in millions, except per share data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock  Effective price per share (1) $ 174.73  $ 132.32 Deposits under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Effective price per share is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Companys class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Companys current certificate of incorporation. ##TABLE_END Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer. Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conversion rate. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2019 , all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from transfer restrictions. A total of 140 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market. Preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Companys assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. The Company had 5 million shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 . The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of UKI and Europe preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the Closing, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the UKI or Europe preferred stock (whether by such 12th anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the holder would receive either class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Companys charter). The class A equivalent preferred stock will be freely transferable and each share of class A equivalent preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Voting rights. The holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what the Companys class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the UKI and Europe preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the class A equivalent preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the UKI and Europe preferred stock. Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the class A common stockholders in a single class, and (ii) in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Companys common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock. Dividends declared. The Company declared and paid $ 2.3 billion in dividends in fiscal 2019 at a quarterly rate of $ 0.25 per share in the fiscal year. On October 22, 2019 , the Companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UKI and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 3, 2019 , to all holders of record of the Companys common and preferred stock as of November 15, 2019 . Note 15Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of each class of common stock outstanding reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 14Stockholders Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UKI and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Note 16Share-based Compensation 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan The Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (options), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based shares to its employees and non-employee directors, for up to 236 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for award may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. The EIP will continue to be in effect until all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is terminated earlier by the Companys board of directors. Awards may be granted under the plan until January 31, 2022. Share-based compensation cost is recorded net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis for awards with service conditions only, and on a graded-vesting basis for awards with service, performance and market conditions. For fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 388 million , $ 312 million and $ 224 million , respectively, in personnel expense on its consolidated statements of operations. The related tax benefits were $ 59 million , $ 53 million and $ 67 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Options Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,    Expected term (in years) (1) 3.98  4.00  4.23 Risk-free rate of return (2) 2.9 %  2.0 %  1.6 % Expected volatility (3) 20.2 %  18.3 %  20.2 % Expected dividend yield (4) 0.7 %  0.7 %  0.8 % Fair value per option granted $ 25.89  $ 18.24  $ 13.90 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Until March 2018, this assumption was based on the Companys historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believed to be generally comparable to Visa. The Companys data was weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visas IPO date as a percentage of the options contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visas data and peer data for stock options granted until March 2018 was approximately 97 % and 3 % in fiscal 2018 , respectively, and 87 % and 13 % in fiscal 2017 , respectively. The assumptions for stock options granted after March 2018 was based on Visas historical exercise experience as the passage of time since the Companys IPO has exceeded 10 years . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Based on the Companys implied and historical volatility. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Based on the Companys annual dividend rate on the date of grant. ##TABLE_END VISA INC.

As of September 30, 2019 , there was $ 19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.50 years. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units RSAs and RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, the RSAs are settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the vesting period, RSA award recipients are eligible to receive dividends and participate in the same voting rights as those granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Companys option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock. The Company discontinued granting RSAs in fiscal 2016 but will continue to grant RSUs under the EIP. As of September 30, 2018, there were no RSAs outstanding. The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSAs and RSUs is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 137.38 , $ 111.11 and $ 81.67 , respectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 228 million , $ 183 million and $ 163 million , respectively. VISA INC.

Performance-based Shares For the Companys performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of shares to be earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market conditions. The performance condition is based on the Companys earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Companys total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies that are included in the Standard  Poors 500 Index. The fair value of the performance-based shares, incorporating the market condition, is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant-date fair value of performance-based shares granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 153.42 , $ 120.11 and $ 86.37 per share, respectively. Earned performance shares granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 vest approximately three years from the initial grant date. All performance awards are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance. It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period. The following table summarizes the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned and related activity for fiscal 2019 : ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (in millions) Outstanding at September 30, 2018 999,416  $ 102.07     Granted (2) 540,538  $ 153.42     Vested and earned ( 419,908 )  $ 97.71     Unearned   $      Forfeited ( 49,356 )  $ 127.66     Outstanding at September 30, 2019 1,070,690  $ 129.08  0.80  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  Calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2019 of $ 172.01 by the number of instruments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2)  Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. ##TABLE_END At September 30, 2019 , there was $ 37 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.80 years.

The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Companys statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5 % , which was reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 In transitioning to the territorial tax system, the Tax Act required the Company to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in its fiscal 2018 taxable income. Such foreign earnings were subject to a one-time tax at 15.5% on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents, and at 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. The 15.5% and 8% tax, collectively referred to as the transition tax, was estimated to be $ 1.1 billion , and was recorded as a provisional amount in fiscal 2018. The Company also recorded provisional amounts for the tax effects of various other new provisions in fiscal 2018. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and various provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. In addition, the Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and a tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. In fiscal 2019, the Company adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. At September 30, 2019 and 2018 , net deferred tax assets of $ 24 million and $ 14 million , respectively, are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The fiscal 2019 and 2018 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years.  As of September 30, 2019 , the Company had $ 17 million federal, $ 19 million state and $ 311 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards from acquired subsidiaries. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards generated in years prior to fiscal 2018 will expire in fiscal 2028 through 2037. Federal net operating losses generated after fiscal 2017 and the foreign net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company expects to fully utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards in future years. The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate to pretax income, as a result of the following: ##TABLE_START  For the Years Ended September 30,     Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  Dollars  Percent  (in millions, except percentages) U.S. federal income tax at statutory rate $ 3,126  %  $ 3,141  %  $ 4,093  % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  %   %   % Non-U.S. tax effect, net of federal benefit ( 527 )  ( 4 )%  ( 465 )  ( 4 )%  ( 641 )  ( 5 )% Transition tax on foreign earnings    %  1,147  %     % Remeasurement of deferred tax balances    %  ( 1,133 )  ( 9 )%     % Reorganization of Visa Europe and other legal entities    %     %  1,515  % Other, net ( 18 )   %  ( 386 )  ( 3 )%  ( 172 )  ( 2 )% Income tax provision $ 2,804  %  $ 2,505  %  $ 4,995  % ##TABLE_ENDThe effective income tax rate was 19 % in fiscal 2019 and 20 % in fiscal 2018 .

The Companys operating hub in the Asia Pacific region is located in Singapore. It is subject to a tax incentive which is effective through September 30, 2023, and is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive decreased Singapore tax by $ 324 million , $ 295 million and $ 252 million , and the benefit of the tax incentive on diluted earnings per share was $ 0.14 , $ 0.13 and $ 0.11 in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740Income Taxes , the Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.

Included in the $ 2.2 billion , $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.4 billion are $ 1.4 billion , $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period. A reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits by fiscal year is as follows:  ##TABLE_START     (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,658  $ 1,353  $ 1,160 Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years   Decreases of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years ( 13 )  ( 233 )  ( 59 ) Increases of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year   Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 9 )     Reductions related to lapsing statute of limitations ( 2 )  ( 1 )  ( 1 ) Balance at end of period $ 2,234  $ 1,658  $ 1,353 ##TABLE_ENDVISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 It is the Companys policy to account for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $ 66 million , $ 15 million and $ 23 million of interest expense in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Company accrued $ 5 million and $ 1 million of penalties in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017, respectively, and accrued no penalties in fiscal 2018, related to uncertain tax positions. At September 30, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had accrued interest of $ 165 million and $ 99 million , respectively, and accrued penalties of $ 26 million and $ 34 million , respectively, related to uncertain tax positions included in other long-term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. The Companys fiscal 2012 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax return is currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. The Company has filed federal refund claims for fiscal years 2008 through 2011, which are also currently under IRS examination. Except for the refund claims, the federal statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2012. The Companys fiscal years 2006 through 2015 California tax returns are currently under examination. The California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2006. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Companys fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Companys fiscal 2010 through 2017 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. In April 2016, the Company petitioned the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRAs assessments. Legal proceedings continue to be in progress. The Company continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The India tax authorities completed the first level examination of the Companys income tax returns for the taxable years falling within the period from fiscal 2010 to 2015, and proposed certain assessments. The Company objected to these proposed assessments and filed appeals to the appellate authorities. While the timing and outcome of the final resolution of these appeals are uncertain, the Company believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its income tax obligations in India. The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. Note 20Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on managements understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation by fiscal year: ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,428  $ Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation  Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 600 )  ( 150 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,198  $ 1,428 ##TABLE_ENDDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, pursuant to an amended settlement agreement that superseded the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded an additional accrual and deposited $ 600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account and in fiscal 2019 paid the amount into court-authorized settlement accounts established under the amended settlement agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 370 million and deposited $ 300 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address opt-out claims for merchants who opted out of the amended settlement agreement. See further discussion below under Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions and Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Accrual SummaryVE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the conversion rates applicable to the UKI preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation by fiscal year: ##TABLE_START    (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $   $ Accrual for VE territory covered litigation  Payments for VE territory covered litigation ( 160 )  ( 2 ) Balance at end of period $  $  ##TABLE_ENDU.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Putative Class Actions Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S. financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally challenged, among other things, Visas and Mastercards purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their no surcharge and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visas reorganization and IPO, under the federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International Incorporated, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the 2012 Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiffs claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately $ 4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account and approximately $ 500 million attributable to interchange reductions for an eight -month period into court-authorized settlement accounts. Visa subsequently received from the Court and deposited into the Companys U.S. litigation escrow account takedown payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion . On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower courts certification of the merchant class, reversed the approval of the settlement, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a Damages Class and an Injunctive Relief Class. The plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class subsequently filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, seeking money damages and attorneys fees, among other relief. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a class action complaint against Visa, Mastercard, and certain bank defendants seeking, among other things, an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and against various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee, as well as attorneys fees. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 On September 17, 2018, Visa, Mastercard, and certain U.S. financial institutions reached an agreement with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class to resolve all Damages Class claims (the Amended Settlement Agreement), subject to court approval. The Amended Settlement Agreement supersedes the 2012 Settlement Agreement and includes, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability arising out of conduct alleged by the Damages Class in the litigation, including claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement becomes final. Participating class members will not release injunctive relief claims as a named representative or non-representative class member in the putative Injunctive Relief Class. The Amended Settlement Agreement also required an additional settlement payment from all defendants totaling $ 900 million , with the Companys share of $ 600 million paid from the Companys litigation escrow account established pursuant to the Companys retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The additional settlement payment was added to the approximately $ 5.3 billion previously deposited into settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement. Based on the percentage of class members (by payment volume) that opted out of the class, following final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement $ 700 million will be returned to defendants. Visas portion of the takedown payment is calculated to be approximately $ 467 million , and upon receipt, will be deposited into the litigation escrow account with a corresponding increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims. On January 24, 2019, the district court granted preliminary approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement, and on June 7, 2019, the Damages Class plaintiffs moved for final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement class have objected to the settlement and/or submitted requests to opt out of the settlement class. The district court held a settlement approval hearing on November 7, 2019. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. On January 16, 2019, the bank defendants moved to dismiss the claims brought against them by the Injunctive Relief Class on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing and failed to state a claim against the bank defendants. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Individual Merchant Actions Since May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in or removed to various federal district courts by hundreds of merchants generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated and Mastercard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. A number of the cases include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. Some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. In addition, some cases assert that Visa, Mastercard and/or their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. Certain individual merchants have filed amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for damages. In addition to the cases filed by individual merchants, Visa, Mastercard, and certain U.S. financial institution defendants in MDL 1720 filed complaints against certain merchants in the Eastern District of New York seeking, in part, a declaration that Visas conduct did not violate federal or state antitrust laws. The individual merchant actions described in this section have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL 1720, or have been transferred or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. These individual merchant actions are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in the putative class actions and individual merchant actions, but the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. While the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address monetary liability in these matters, see Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , judgments or settlements that require the Company to change its business practices, rules, or contractual commitments could adversely affect the Companys financial results. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 500 Merchants (the capitalized term Merchant, when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and Germany primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions: UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 400 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future. A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by only one Merchant. In judgments published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that Visas UK domestic interchange did not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to be restrictive it would not be exemptible under applicable law. In April 2018, the Court of Appeal heard the Merchants appeal of the decision alongside two separate Mastercard cases also involving interchange claims. On July 4, 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower courts rulings, finding that Visas UK domestic interchange restricted competition and the question of whether Visas UK domestic interchange was exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law had been incorrectly decided. The Court of Appeal remitted the claim to the lower court to reconsider the exemption issue and the assessment of damages. On November 29, 2018, Visa was granted permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeals judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, including the question of whether Visas UK interchange restricted competition. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the appeal in January 2020. The full scope of damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been served and Visa has substantial defenses. However, the claims that have been issued, served and/or preserved seek several billion dollars in damages. Other Litigation European Commission DCC Investigation In 2013, the European Commission (EC) opened an investigation against Visa Europe, based on a complaint alleging that Visa Europes pricing of and rules relating to Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) transactions infringe EU competition rules. This investigation is pending. Canadian Merchant Litigation Beginning in December 2010, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta against Visa Canada, Mastercard and ten financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept payment by Visa and/or Mastercard credit cards. The actions allege a violation of Canadas price-fixing law and various common law claims based on separate Visa and Mastercard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the networks rules. In 2015 and 2016, four financial institutions settled with the plaintiffs. In June 2017, Visa, Mastercard and a fifth financial institution also reached settlements with the plaintiffs. Settlement approval hearings were held in 2018 and courts in each of the five provinces approved the settlements. Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. have filed notices of appeal of the decisions approving the settlements. On August 30, 2019, September 9, 2019, and October 17, 2019, the Court of Appeals in British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario, respectively, rejected the appeals filed by Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. Appeals are pending in the remaining provinces. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation National ATM Council Class Action . In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Plus System, Inc.) and Mastercard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visas rule (and a similar Mastercard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. On September 20, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. Consumer Class Actions . In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and Mastercard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, Mastercard and three financial institutions as defendants. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees where available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. On September 20, 2019, plaintiffs in both cases filed motions for class certification. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the Division) issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visas competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visas fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. Pulse Network On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that Visa has, among other things, monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse seeks unspecified treble damages, attorneys fees and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure, Visas conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit acceptance. On August 31, 2018, the court granted Visas motion for summary judgment, finding that Pulse did not have standing to pursue its claims. Pulse appealed the district courts summary judgment decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held oral argument on October 9, 2019. EMV Chip Liability Shift Following their initial complaint filed on March 8, 2016, BR Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milams Market, and Grove Liquors LLC filed an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Mastercard, Discover, American Express, EMVCo and certain financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended complaint asserts that defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty or otherwise rejected payment card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, defined as those merchants throughout the U.S. who have been subjected to the Liability Shift since October 2015. Plaintiffs claim that the so-called Liability Shift violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. EMVCo and the financial institution defendants were dismissed, and the matter was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which has clarified that this case is not part of MDL 1720. Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification on July 16, 2018, following an earlier denial of the motion without prejudice. Plaintiffs renewed motion was terminated without prejudice to reinstatement on October 17, 2018, but was subsequently reinstated and is currently pending. VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) September 30, 2019 Nuts for Candy On April 5, 2017, plaintiff Nuts for Candy, on behalf of itself and a putative class of California merchants that have accepted Visa-branded cards since January 1, 2004, filed a lawsuit against Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa U.S.A. in California state court. Nuts for Candy pursues claims under California state antitrust and unfair business statutes, seeking damages, costs and other remedies. On October 18, 2018, the court stayed the Nuts for Candy case pending the district courts decision on preliminary and final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement discussed above under Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)  Putative Class Actions . Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense On October 15, 2018, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) initiated an investigation against Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Elo seeking information regarding potential competition law violations with respect to network rules that require acquirers to receive certain information from payment facilitators. On October 15, 2019, CADE issued a recommendation to dismiss the investigation, which was dismissed as of October 30, 2019. Australian Competition  Consumer Commission On July 12, 2019, the Australian Competition  Consumer Commission (ACCC) informed Visa that the ACCC has commenced an investigation into certain agreements and interchange fees relating to Visa Debit. Visa is cooperating with the ACCC. Federal Trade Commission Voluntary Access Letter On November 4, 2019, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the Bureau) requested that Visa provide, on a voluntary basis, documents and information for an investigation as to whether Visas actions inhibited merchant choice in the selection of debit payments networks in potential violation of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Visa is cooperating with the Bureau.

Controls and Procedures ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2019 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 . Based on managements assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2019 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors of this report. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 , has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In preparation for managements report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During fiscal 2019 , the Company implemented a new client incentives accounting system along with enhancements and modifications to existing internal controls and procedures to comply with the new revenue standard. There were no other significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2019 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.
