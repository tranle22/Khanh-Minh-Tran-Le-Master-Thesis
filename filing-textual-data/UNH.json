BUSINESS ##TABLE_END INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a diversified health and well-being company, serving more than 70 million Americans (the terms we, our, us UnitedHealth Group or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and our subsidiaries). Our focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with physicians and other health care professionals, hospitals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. During 2009, we managed approximately $120 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the constituents and consumers we served. Our primary focus is on improving the health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery, promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care, and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to improve access to health and well-being services, simplify the health care experience, promote quality and make health care more affordable. These core competencies are focused in two market areas  health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. We have four reporting segments: ##TABLE_START    Health Benefits (formerly Health Care Services), which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Ingenix; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Prescription Solutions ##TABLE_END For a discussion of our financial results by reporting segment, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

DESCRIPTION OF REPORTING SEGMENTS Health Benefits Our Health Benefits reporting segment consists of the following businesses: UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice. The financial results of UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been aggregated in the Health Benefits reporting segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, types of customers, distribution methods, operational processes and regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. Health Benefits arranges for discounted access to care through a network of approximately 700,000 physicians and other health care professionals and 5,200 hospitals across the United States. UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare facilitated access to health care services on behalf of approximately 25 million Americans as of December 31, 2009. With its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a one-year period. UnitedHealthcare also provides administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants, for which UnitedHealthcare receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependants, while UnitedHealthcare provides coordination and facilitation of medical services, customer and health care professional services and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Large employer groups, such as those serviced by UnitedHealthcare National Accounts, typically use self-funded arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, UnitedHealthcare National Accounts served approximately 380 large employer groups under these arrangements, including 150 of the Fortune 500 companies. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. UnitedHealthcare also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. UnitedHealthcare offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third party administrators (TPAs). UnitedHealthcares product strategy centers on several principles: consumer choice, broad access to health professionals, and use of data and science to promote better outcomes, quality service, transparency and affordability. Integrated wellness programs and services help individuals make informed decisions, maintain healthy lifestyles and optimize health outcomes by coordinating access to care services and providing personalized, targeted education and information services.  Individuals served by UnitedHealthcare have access to approximately 88% of the physicians and other health care professionals and 96% of the hospitals in the Health Benefits network. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals. Directly or through UnitedHealth Groups family of companies, UnitedHealthcare offers: ##TABLE_START   A comprehensive range of benefit plans integrating medical, ancillary and alternative care products so customers can choose benefits that are right for them; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Affordability across a broad set of price points and a wide product line, from offerings covering essential needs to comprehensive benefit plans, all of which offer access to our broad-based proprietary network of contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals with economic benefits reflective of the aggregate purchasing capacity of our organization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Innovative clinical programs that are built around an extensive clinical data set and principles of evidence-based medicine; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Consumer access to information about physician and hospital performance against quality and cost efficiency criteria based on claims data assessment through the UnitedHealth Premium Designation Program and the UnitedHealth Hospital Comparison Program; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Physician and facility access to performance feedback information to support continuous quality improvement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Care facilitation services that use several identification tools, including proprietary predictive technology to identify individuals with significant gaps in care and unmet needs or risks for potential health problems, and then facilitate appropriate interventions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Disease and condition management programs to help individuals address significant, complex disease states; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Convenient self-service tools for health transactions and information. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcares regional and national access to broad, affordable and quality networks of health care professionals has advanced over the past several years, with significant increases in access to services throughout the United States. UnitedHealthcare has also organized health care alliances with select regional not-for-profit health plans to facilitate greater customer access and affordability. UnitedHealthcares innovation distinguishes its product offerings from its competition. Its consumer-oriented health benefits and services value individual choice and control in accessing health care. UnitedHealthcare has programs that provide health education, admission counseling before hospital stays, care advocacy to help avoid delays in patients stays in the hospital, support for individuals at risk of needing intensive treatment and coordination of care for people with chronic conditions. To provide consumers with the necessary resources and information to make more informed choices when managing their health, data-driven networks and clinical management are organized through clinical lines of service such as cardiology, oncology, neuroscience, orthopedics, womens health, primary care and emergency services. UnitedHealthcare also offers comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services that promote lower costs by using formulary programs that drive better unit costs for drugs, benefit designs that encourage consumers to use drugs that offer better value and outcomes, and physician and consumer programs that support the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence. UnitedHealthcare provides innovative programs that enable consumers to take ownership and control of their health care benefits. These products include high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans coupled with health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), or health savings accounts (HSAs), and are offered on a self-funded and fully-insured basis. UnitedHealthcare provided these products to approximately 24,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans during 2009, including approximately 150 employers in the large group self-funded market serviced by UnitedHealthcare National Accounts.  UnitedHealthcares distribution system consists primarily of brokers and direct and internet sales in the individual market, brokers in the small employer group market, and brokers and other consultant-based or direct sales for large employer and public sector groups. UnitedHealthcares direct distribution efforts are generally limited to the individual market, portions of the large employer group and public sector markets, and cross-selling of specialty products to existing customers. Ovations Ovations provides health and well-being services for individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as for services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. Ovations is fully dedicated to this market segment, as it provides products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories. Ovations participates nationally in the Medicare program, offering a wide-ranging spectrum of Medicare products, including Medigap products that supplement traditional fee-for-service coverage, more traditional health-plan-type programs under Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, and special offerings for beneficiaries who are chronically ill and/or Medicaid and Medicare dual-eligible. Ovations has extensive capabilities and experience with distribution, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients  AARP, the nations largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, state and U.S. government agencies and employer groups. Ovations also has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to risk-based health products and services in the senior and geriatric markets. Ovations currently has a number of contracts with Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), which primarily relate to the Medicare health benefit programs authorized under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Premium revenues from CMS were 27% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, most of which were generated by Ovations. Ovations provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS. Ovations also offers Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Special Needs Plans, Point-of-Service (POS) plans and Private-Fee-for-Service plans. Under the Medicare Advantage programs, Ovations provides health insurance coverage to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based on the geographic areas in which members reside, demographic factors such as age, gender, and institutionalized status, and the health status of the individual. Ovations offers Medicare Advantage products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2009, Ovations had approximately 1.8 million enrolled individuals in its Medicare Advantage products. Additionally, Ovations provides the Medicare prescription drug benefit (Part D) to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories. Among the several Part D plans it offers, Ovations provides Medicare Part D coverage plans with the AARP brand. Ovations provides Part D drug coverage through its Medicare Advantage program, Special Needs Plans (covering individuals who live in an institutional long-term care setting, individuals dual-eligible for Medicaid and Medicare services or individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions) and stand-alone Part D plans. As of December 31, 2009, Ovations had enrolled approximately 5.9 million members in the Part D program, including approximately 4.3 million members in the stand-alone Part D plans and approximately 1.6 million members in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Part D coverage. In association with AARP, Ovations provides a range of standardized Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity insurance offerings from its insurance company affiliates to approximately 3.8 million AARP members. Additional Ovations services include a nurse healthline service, a lower cost standardized Medicare supplement offering that provides consumers with a national hospital network, 24-hour access to health care information, and access to discounted health services from a network of physicians.  Ovations also provides complete, individualized care planning and care benefits for aging, disabled and chronically ill individuals. Ovations serves approximately 365,000 individuals (including approximately 255,000 individuals in the Medicare Advantage products) across the nation in long-term care settings including nursing homes, community-based settings and private homes, as well as through hospice and palliative care. Ovations offers services through innovative care management and clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through a continuum of products from Special Needs Plans and long-term care Medicaid programs to hospice care, and serves people in 35 states and in the District of Columbia in home, community and nursing home settings. These services are provided primarily through nurse practitioners, nurses and care managers. Ovations also offers a comprehensive eldercare service program providing service coordination, consultation, claim management and information resources nationwide. Proprietary, automated medical record software enables the Ovations clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of coherent care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings for high-risk populations. Ovations also operates hospice and palliative care programs in 16 local markets in 11 states. AmeriChoice AmeriChoice provides network-based health and well-being services to beneficiaries of State Medicaid Childrens Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), and other government-sponsored health care programs. AmeriChoice provides health insurance coverage to eligible Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from the applicable state. AmeriChoice also offers government agencies a number of diverse management service programs, including a clinical care consulting program, disease and conditions management, pharmacy benefit services and administrative and technology services, to help them effectively administer their distinct health care delivery systems and benefits for individuals in their programs. AmeriChoice also contracts with CMS for the provision of Special Needs Plans serving individuals dual-eligible for Medicaid and Medicare services. These programs are primarily organized toward enrolling individuals who are dual-eligible for Medicaid and Medicare coverage in states where AmeriChoice operates its Medicaid health plans. As of December 31, 2009, AmeriChoice covered 2.8 million beneficiaries through all of its programs in 22 states and District of Columbia. AmeriChoices approach is grounded in its belief that health care cannot be provided effectively without considering all of the factors (social, behavioral, economic, environmental, and physical) that affect a persons life. AmeriChoice coordinates resources among family members, physicians, other health care professionals and government and community-based agencies and organizations to provide continuous and effective care. For members, this means that the AmeriChoice Personal Care Model offers them a holistic approach to health care, emphasizing practical programs to improve their living circumstances as well as quality medical care and treatment in accessible, culturally sensitive, community-oriented settings. For example, AmeriChoices disease management and outreach programs focus on high-prevalence and debilitating illnesses such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, asthma, sickle cell disease, diabetes, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), cancer and high-risk pregnancy. AmeriChoice has developed several of these programs with the help of leading researchers and clinicians at academic medical centers and medical schools. For physicians, the AmeriChoice Personal Care Model means assistance with coordination of their patients care. AmeriChoice utilizes sophisticated technology to monitor preventive care interventions and evidence-based treatment protocols to support care management. AmeriChoice operates advanced and unique pharmacy administrative services, including benefit design, generic drug incentive programs, drug utilization review and preferred drug list development to help optimize the use of appropriate quality pharmaceuticals and concurrently manage pharmacy expenditures to levels appropriate to the specific clinical situations. For state customers, the AmeriChoice Personal Care Model means increased access to care and improved quality for their beneficiaries, in a measurable system that reduces their administrative burden and lowers their costs. AmeriChoice considers a variety of factors when determining in which state programs to participate and on what  basis. They include a states consistency of support for service innovation and funding of its Medicaid program, the population base, the commitment of the physician/provider community to the AmeriChoice Personal Care Model, and the presence of community-based organizations that can partner with AmeriChoice to meet member needs. OptumHealth OptumHealth serves nearly 58 million unique individuals with its diversified offering of health, financial and ancillary benefit services and products that assist consumers in navigating the health care system, accessing health services based on their needs, supporting their emotional health and well-being, providing ancillary insurance benefits and helping people finance their health care needs through account-based programs. OptumHealth seeks to simplify the consumer health care experience and facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of care. Its capabilities can be deployed individually or integrated to provide a comprehensive solution oriented around a broad base of consumer needs within the health care system. OptumHealths simple, modular service designs can be easily integrated to meet varying employer, payer, public sector and consumer needs at a wide range of price points. OptumHealth offers its products on an administrative fee basis where it manages and administers benefit claims for self-insured customers in exchange for a fixed fee per individual served, and on a risk basis, where OptumHealth assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per individual served. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth distributes its products through three strategic markets: employer (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid and small employers), payer (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, third party administrators, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and public sector (which includes Medicaid, Medicare and Federal procurement). OptumHealth is one brand, organized into four major operating groups: OptumHealth Care Solutions, OptumHealth Financial Services, OptumHealth Behavioral Solutions and OptumHealth Specialty Benefits. Care Solutions. Care Solutions serves more than 40 million individuals through personalized health management solutions that improve peoples health and well-being, improve clinical outcomes and workforce productivity and reduce health care costs. Programs include wellness and prevention, disease management, case management, physical health programs, complex condition management, specialized provider networks, personalized health portals and consumer marketing services.

Financial Services. Financial Services provides health-based financial services for consumers, employers, payers and health care professionals. These financial services include HSAs, HRAs and Flexible Spending Accounts offered through OptumHealth Bank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank. As of December 31, 2009, Financial Services had approximately $860 million in assets under management. Financial Services health benefit card programs include electronic systems for verification of benefit coverage and eligibility. Financial Services also provides electronic payment and statement services for health care professionals and payers. In 2009, Financial Services electronically transmitted $36 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. Behavioral Solutions. Behavioral Solutions serves 43 million individuals with its employee assistance programs, work/life offerings, and clinically driven behavioral health, substance abuse and psychiatric disability management programs.

Stop-loss insurance is marketed throughout the United States through a network of TPAs, brokers and consultants. Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting and actuarial services, business process outsourcing services and pharmaceutical data consulting and research services in conjunction with the development of pharmaceutical products on a nationwide and international basis. As of December 31, 2009, Ingenixs customers include approximately 6,000 hospitals, 245,000 physicians, 2,000 payers and intermediaries, 200 Fortune 500 companies, 655 life sciences companies, 350 government entities, and 135 United Kingdom Government Payers, as well as other UnitedHealth Group businesses. Ingenix is engaged in the simplification of health care administration with information and technology. Ingenix helps customers accurately and efficiently manage the information flowing through the health care system. Ingenix uses data to help advance transparency on cost and quality and help customers streamline their processes to make health care more efficient. Ingenix is a leader in contract research services, and pharmacoeconomics, epidemiology and safety and outcomes (including comparative effectiveness) research through its i3 businesses. Ingenixs products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force focused on specific customers and market segments across the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, employer, government, hospital, physician, payer and property and casualty insurance market segments. Ingenixs products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliance and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface its products with their applications. Many of Ingenixs contract research services, consulting arrangements and software and related information services are performed over an extended period, often several years. Ingenix maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts or other legally binding agreements that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. Ingenixs aggregate backlog at December 31, 2009 was $2.2 billion, of which $1.6 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $0.7 billion related to intersegment agreements all of which are included in the current portion. Ingenix cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation or early termination of certain service arrangements. The Ingenix companies are divided into two groups: Information Services and i3. Information Services. Information Services diverse product offerings help clients strengthen health care administration and advance health care outcomes. These products include health care utilization reporting and analytics, physician clinical performance benchmarking, clinical data warehousing, analysis and management responses for medical cost trend management, physician practice revenue cycle management, including integrated electronic medical record systems, revenue and payment cycle management for payer and health care professional organizations, payment accuracy solutions, decision-support portals for evaluation of health benefits and treatment options, risk management solutions, connectivity solutions and claims management tools to reduce administrative errors and support fraud recovery services.

In addition to PBM services, Prescription Solutions Consumer Health Products division delivers diabetic testing and other specialized medical supplies, over the counter items, vitamins and supplements directly to members homes. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. This regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Federal and state governments continue to enact and consider  various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system, including proposals to address the affordability and availability of health insurance and to reduce the number of uninsured individuals. The interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, could negatively affect our business. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws, regulations and rules. In the event we fail to comply with federal and state regulations, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state government regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of federal regulation. CMS regulates Ovations and AmeriChoice Medicare and Medicaid businesses. CMS has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to Medicare beneficiaries. Our Health Benefits reporting segment, through AmeriChoice and Ovations, also has Medicaid and SCHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services, and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations surrounding Medicare and Medicaid compliance. When we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. In addition, the portion of Ingenixs business that includes clinical research is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust also affect us. HIPAA, GLBA and Other Privacy and Security Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. HIPAA requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals. It also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions. Federal regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us. Federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation, regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation. For example, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) which significantly amends, and adds new, privacy and security provisions to HIPAA and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information. AARA includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with HIPAA, GLBA and other privacy-related regulations.  ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. Additionally, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third-party claims administration services for health care plans. FDIC. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has federal regulatory and supervisory authority over OptumHealth Bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the FDIC performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable federal banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subject to increased operational expenses, governmental oversight and monetary penalties. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. With the amendment of the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to adopt elements substantially similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, managed care organization (MCO), utilization review (UR) or third-party administrator-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, but may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices, and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services, and improper marketing. Our AmeriChoice and Ovations Medicaid businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits by AmeriChoice to its Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries and by Ovations to its Medicaid beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Pharmacy Regulation. Prescription Solutions mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the state in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and  regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. Privacy and Security Laws. States have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the GLBA. Like HIPAA, GLBA allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. A number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy-related regulations. UDFI. In addition, the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) has state regulatory and supervisory authority over OptumHealth Bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the UDFI in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses, governmental oversight and monetary penalties. Commitments. In connection with the PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (PacifiCare) and Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra) acquisitions, which closed in December 2005 and February 2008, respectively, certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments, principally in California and Nevada. Many of the PacifiCare commitments in California expired on December 19, 2009. We believe that none of the remaining commitments in any of the affected states will materially affect our operations. Audits and Investigations We have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor and other governmental authorities. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation, audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business. International Regulation Some of our business units, including Ingenixs i3 business, have international operations. These international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, including various tax, tariff and trade regulations, as well as employment, intellectual property, privacy, and investment rules and laws.  COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our Health Benefits businesses, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our Prescription Solutions businesses, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 80,000 individuals. We believe our employee relations are generally positive.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, plan, project, should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications.  Proposed health care reforms could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial position and our results of operations. Both houses of Congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform, which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, guaranteed coverage requirements, elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits, restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards, or restructuring the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including reducing payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage over the intermediate term. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation, which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there is legislative interest in modifying ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. A number of state legislatures, including California, Colorado, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, have contemplated but have not enacted significant reform of their health insurance markets. Other states are expected to consider significant reform of their health insurance markets as well as more modest reforms aimed at expanding Medicaid and/or SCHIP eligibility and new coverage options for those not eligible for government programs. These proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements. States also are considering proposals that would reform the underwriting and marketing practices of individual and group health insurance products by, for example, placing restrictions on rating and pricing and mandating minimum medical benefit cost ratios. The enactment of health care reforms at the federal or state level may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and/or other health care professionals; medical, administrative, technology or other costs; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; premium rates; coverage determinations; mandated benefits; minimum medical expenditures; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; collection, use, disclosure, maintenance and disposal of individually identifiable health information; personal health records; consumer-driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. If we fail to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, the profitability of our risk-based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a  12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period; however, medical cost inflation, regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2009 would have been reduced by approximately $200 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, they will have a negative impact on our future results. Our business activities are highly regulated; new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, in 2009, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such reductions. The broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business, as well as future laws and rules, could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. For example, in October 2008 Congress enacted the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA), which requires insurers to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits under terms that are no more restrictive than those applied to medical and surgical benefits. The MHPAEA specifically directed the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury to issue regulations to effectuate the legislation. Although regulations regarding how the MHPAEA will be implemented were issued on February 2, 2010 in the form of an interim final rule, final regulations have not yet been published. Because of the broad range of treatment limitations to which parity is expected to apply under the regulations, the regulations will likely lead to an increase in the costs associated with both insured and self-insured plans for behavioral health benefits and services and impact our market for carve-out health benefit administration, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of certain acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. In August 2007, we entered into a multi-state national agreement with regulatory offices in 39 states and the District of Columbia relating to UnitedHealthcares fully insured commercial business administered on the  organizations main processing platforms. The agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations, including claims payment accuracy and timeliness, appeals and grievances resolution timeliness, health care professional network/service, utilization review, explanation of benefits accuracy, and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance. The agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to August 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through December 2010. The agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee, whereby we self report quarterly and annually our current operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states. We must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement, or be subject to fines and penalties. We are also involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These regulatory activities include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor and other governmental authorities. For example, in 2007, the California Department of Insurance examined our PacifiCare health insurance plan in California. The examination findings related to claims processing accuracy and timeliness, accurate and timely interest payments, timely implementation of provider contracts, timely, accurate provider dispute resolution, and other related matters. The matter is now the subject of an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor is conducting an investigation of our administration of our employee benefit plans with respect to ERISA compliance. Reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the health care industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity, including negative publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations, may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets and result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products and services, or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. For a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses, see Item 1, Business  Government Regulation. Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. The current recessionary U.S. economic environment may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings have caused and could continue to lead to lower enrollment in our employer group plans, lower enrollment in our non-employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans. Adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, the economic downturn could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers. All of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers and therefore could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs.  During a prolonged economic downturn, state and federal budgets could be adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and/or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims, and could adversely affect our results of operations. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products. We provide PBM services through our Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our PBM businesses. Our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions. Prescription Solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose Prescription Solutions to civil and criminal penalties. Further, Prescription Solutions is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands. The failure to adhere to such standards could expose Prescription Solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions. In addition, our PBM businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our mail order pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. We compete with other companies on the basis of many factors, including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives, location and choice of health care providers, quality of customer service,  comprehensiveness of coverage offered, reputation for quality care, financial stability and diversity of product offerings. For our Health Benefits reporting segment, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as Medicare specialty services. For our Prescription Solutions business, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS/Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses. We believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or health care professional arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals) in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect, if membership or demand for other services declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a payer in various government health care programs, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and SCHIP, and receive revenues from these programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. For example, CMS recently implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Such changes have adversely affected our results of operations and willingness to participate in such programs in certain geographic areas in the past, and may do so in the future. Our participation in the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and various Medicaid programs and SCHIP occurs through bids that are submitted periodically. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level, and general political issues and priorities. A reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including determining payments by considering the risk status of our Medicare members as supported by provider medical record documentation. Federal regulators audit the supporting documents and can revise payments based on the audit findings. CMS announced in 2008 that it will perform audits of selected Medicare health plans each year to  validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers, including those in and out of network, and may result in prospective and retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to CMS Medicare contracts. Certain of our plans have been selected for audit. The first audits focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts. The Office of Inspector General for HHS is conducting an audit of our risk adjustment data for two plans. We are unable to predict the outcome of the audits. However, any material adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our ability to retain and acquire Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by our competitors and us. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold, which is set by the government after our bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 650,000 of our auto-enrolled low-income subsidy members in 2008 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors bids and positioning are different than anticipated, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or otherwise, our results of operations could be materially affected. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices and services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services. Failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with  whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. In addition, some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding with the provider about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. For example, we are involved in litigation with out-of-network providers that is described in more detail in Legal Matters in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with out-of-network health care providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers, consultants and agents. Our products are sold in part through independent brokers, consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our independent brokers, consultants and agents, who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and/or market health care products and services of our competitors. As a result, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers, consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to them regarding our product portfolio, which is complex, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. In addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies products. For example, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market Medicare products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changes to industry practice, which could adversely impact our ability to market our products. If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and data security regulations, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality and security, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal GLBA and in HIPAA. HIPAA now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates and in certain cases assess our business associates security controls, we still have limited control over their actions and  practices. Privacy and security requirements regarding personally identifiable information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations, such as ARRA, will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes (including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards), new limitations or constraints on our business models, the development of new administrative processes, the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates, and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, including mandatory disclosure to the media, significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents, increased enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages, litigation, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business, and injunctive relief. Our relationship with AARP is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with AARP, we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance and other products to AARP members and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to AARP members and non-members. One of our agreements with AARP expands the relationship to include AARP-branded Medicare Advantage plans for AARP members and non-members. Our agreements with AARP contain commitments regarding corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers. The AARP agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances, including, depending on the agreement, a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company, material changes in the Medicare programs, material harm to AARP caused by the Company, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, meet our corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and diversity commitments, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The loss of our AARP relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive  damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters; however, it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2009. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform on their obligations, could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in net realized investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. We also invest a small proportion of our investments in equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, illiquidity or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our shareholders equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected. Goodwill and other intangible assets were $23.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, representing 39% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. For example, the enactment of health care reforms may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in some of our businesses, as any passed legislation may significantly change the growth rate assumptions for some of our businesses. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Large-scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. Such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the U.S. economy in general and the health care industry specifically. For example, in the event of a natural disaster, bioterrorism attack, pandemic or other extreme events, we could face, among other things, significant medical costs and increased use of health care services. Any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been taking steps to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. In addition, we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected.  Any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by recognized rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on UnitedHealth Groups common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group (the  Fortune 50 Group), an index of certain Fortune 50 companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2009. The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2009. The Company is not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2004 in Company common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.  Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy. ##TABLE_START   12/04  12/05  12/06  12/07  12/08  12/09 UnitedHealth Group  $ 100.00  $ 141.22  $ 122.18  $ 132.41  $ 60.57  $ 69.51 SP 500   100.00   104.91   121.48   128.16   80.74   102.11 Fortune 50 Group   100.00   99.04   112.31   105.03   55.31   61.84 ##TABLE_END The stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Our focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well-being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and contract research businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders.  Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business, however, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs, will change the dynamics of our results. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims, purchases of investments, common stock repurchases and payments on long-term debt. For more information on our cash flows, see Liquidity below. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 17% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, based on inflation, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and proposed health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition contributed more than half of the 7% decrease in UnitedHealthcares commercial membership during 2009, and this attrition trend is expected to continue at a generally elevated level until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. Changes in federal monetary policy have reduced the level of investment income received on our portfolio on a year-over-year basis. In total, we believe that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession. These elements include expansion of funding to state programs, which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix. Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes. Both houses of Congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform, which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, guaranteed coverage requirements, elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits, restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards, or restructuring the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including reducing payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. We cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years, but, if enacted, could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our operating results, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. The administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Further, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by these reductions. If industry-wide Medicare Advantage membership declines, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is a market leader. We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid- to long-term time horizon. For discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.

On June 1, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. (AIM) for approximately $440 million in cash. AIM is a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions for health care payer and hospital clients in all 50 states. This acquisition strengthened our capabilities to simplify and improve administration in the health care industry. The results of operations and financial condition of AIM have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Ingenix reporting segment since the acquisition date. Unison Health Plans. On May 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government-sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. This acquisition strengthened our resources and capabilities in these areas. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in our consolidated results and the results of our Health Benefits reporting segment since the acquisition date.  Sierra Health Services, Inc. On February 25, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. This acquisition strengthened our position in the southwest region of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of our individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. We received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction, which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, we retained Sierras Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. Fiserv Health, Inc. On January 10, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. This transaction allows us to expand the capacity of our existing benefits administration businesses and enables existing and new customers to leverage our full range of assets, including ancillary services, our national network and technology tools. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed for smaller acquisitions was $95 million, $94 million and $262 million, respectively. These acquisitions were not material to our results of operations. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment-related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate.  Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: ##TABLE_START   Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Ingenix; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Prescription Solutions. ##TABLE_END Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

UnitedHealthcare revenues of $40.8 billion for 2009 decreased by $1.0 billion, or 2%, compared to 2008, as the reduction in individuals served was partially offset by premium rate increases. Ovations revenues of $32.1 billion for 2009 increased by $4.1 billion, or 15%, over 2008, primarily due to an increase in individuals served through Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare Supplement offerings, as well as premium rate increases. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $8.4 billion for 2009, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 40%, over the comparable 2008 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans and premium rate increases as well as the full year impact from the mid-2008 Unison acquisition. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. The 2009 UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 84.0% from 83.5% in 2008, largely due to elevated medical costs related to the H1N1 influenza virus and a higher proportion of participants receiving care under unemployment-related benefit continuation programs. Health Benefits operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations. OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large-scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 58 million and 60 million consumers, respectively. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start-up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance-based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals.  2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The premium revenue growth generated by our Health Benefits reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase. This increase was due to the growth in individuals served by public and senior markets businesses, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily because of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents, decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows, decreased deposits held for certain government-sponsored programs and increased other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation, acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in Ovations Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. For 2008 and 2007, medical costs included $230 million and $420 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as described in 2009 Results of Operations Compared to 2008 Results above, acquisitions completed in 2008, costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee-based businesses. Operating costs for 2007 include $176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. For an expanded discussion of our Section 409A charges, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements, as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to business acquisitions. Income Tax Rate The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax-free investment income to total earnings.  Reporting Segments Health Benefits The revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of Sierra, Fiserv Health, and Unison, partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk-based products and Medicare Part D products and a decrease in investment income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $41.8 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 4%. The UnitedHealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for Health Benefits in 2008. Ovations revenues of $28.1 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products gained through both organic growth and the Sierra acquisition and premium rate increases, which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675,000 stand-alone Medicare Part D members primarily due to the reassignment by CMS of certain dual-eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $6.0 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans, premium rate increases and the acquisition of Unison in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the UnitedHealthcare risk-based business and pressure on gross margins in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, partially offset by acquisitions. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 83.5% in 2008 from 82.6% in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases, net of customer benefit package changes, did not fully match the rise in medical costs, and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business, which typically carries a higher medical care ratio. Health Benefits operating margin was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease from 9.3% in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above. The number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions, which included the addition of 1,315,000 fee-based members from Fiserv Health and the addition of 310,000 risk-based individuals gained through the Sierra acquisition. These additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805,000, or 3%, from December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk-based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products at December 31, 2008 increased through the addition of 60,000 seniors from our acquisition of Sierra and organic growth of 95,000 seniors, partially offset by the divestiture of 30,000 individuals in Nevada related to the Sierra acquisition. Medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320,000 and 60,000 individuals from our Unison and Sierra acquisitions, respectively, and strong organic growth of 425,000 individuals. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment. OptumHealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1 million individuals year-over-year. Earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk-based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business. Ingenix The improvement in Ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects, which were cancelled, as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment.  Prescription Solutions The decreased Prescription Solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual-eligible beneficiaries described above through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization, partially offset by revenues related to the Fiserv Health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $11.0 billion and $12.4 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition, gains in mail service drug fulfillment, and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. The increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in 2009 primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing, as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels. Given expected statutory capital levels, we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010.  Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,  (in millions)  2009   2008   2007  Sources of Cash:    Cash provided by operating activities  $ 5,625   $ 4,238   $ 5,877  Sales of investments   4,040    5,568    1,271  Maturities of investments   2,675    3,030    2,094  Issuance of long-term debt       2,981    3,582  Interest rate swap termination   513          Other   546    1,770    1,962              Total sources of cash   13,399    17,587    14,786              Uses of Cash:    Purchases of investments   (6,466 )   (9,251 )   (6,379 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition   (486 )   (3,813 )   (262 ) Retirement of long-term debt   (1,350 )   (500 )   (950 ) Common stock repurchases   (1,801 )   (2,684 )   (6,599 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net   (99 )   (1,346 )     Other   (823 )   (1,432 )   (2,051 )             Total uses of cash   (11,025 )   (19,026 )   (16,241 )             Net increase (decrease) in cash  $ 2,374   $ (1,439 )  $ (1,455 )             ##TABLE_END 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings, the timing of certain CMS payments and the impact of a legislated change to the timing of payments for Medicare Part D claims. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our policy on offsetting cash balances. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts.  2008 Cash Flows Compared To 2007 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.6 billion, or 28%, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings, which included payments for the settlement of two class action lawsuits described above. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $925 million, or 22%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and increases in the usage of cash in 2008 for purchases of investments offset by the 2008 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $2.6 billion, or 81%, primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases in 2008 offset by the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $24.2 billion included $9.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (which included $2.3 billion held by non-regulated entities), $13.8 billion of debt securities and $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2009. Included in the debt securities balance were $3.0 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. A number of different guarantors guarantee the securities, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2009. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Bank Credit Facility . We have a five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2009. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity, was 32.1% and 38.1% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We complied with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009.  Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of debt securities. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch    Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt  Baa1  Stable  A-  Negative  A-  Negative Commercial paper  P-2  n/a  A-2  n/a  F1  n/a ##TABLE_END The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. In 2009, we repurchased 74.3 million shares at an average price of approximately $24 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 28.7 million shares of our common stock. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2009, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010  2011 to 2012  2013 to 2014  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 2,164  $ 1,361  $ 1,559  $ 6,089  $ 11,173 Interest on debt (b)   545   659   406   3,549   5,159 Operating leases   255   420   272   644   1,591 Purchase obligations (c)   115   31         146 Future policy benefits (d)   139   353   337   1,152   1,981 Unrecognized tax benefits (e)   19         104   123 Unfunded investment commitments (f)   138   42   24   16   220 Other obligations (g)   210   80      252   542                Total contractual obligations  $ 3,585  $ 2,946  $ 2,598  $ 11,806  $ 20,935                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term, including the effect of the debt tender described in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2009 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (d) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (e) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (g) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration related to a business acquisition, certain employee benefit programs, and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs and the charitable contributions have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13. We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but  not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2009, 2008 and 2007, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $310 million, $230 million and $420 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable    (in millions)  (0.75)%  $ 171  (0.50)   114  (0.25)   57  0.25   (57 ) 0.50   (113 ) 0.75   (169 ) ##TABLE_END  Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2009: ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable    (in millions)  3%  $ 332  2   222  1   111  (1)   (111 ) (2)   (222 ) (3)   (332 ) ##TABLE_END The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2009, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2009; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2009 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2009 net earnings would increase or decrease by $52 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.04 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known.  CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2010 and determined that no impairment existed as of December 31, 2009. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms as discussed in Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes above, as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long-term growth rate assumptions for some or all of our reporting units. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., customer lists and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year.  Investments As of December 31, 2009, we had investments with a carrying value of $14.6 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2009, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $493 million and gross unrealized losses of $50 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems.  The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2009 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $58 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2009, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2009, $9.8 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $750 million of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, $14.0 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.4 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap  contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. In January 2009, we terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates. This gain will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed-rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): ##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)   Interest Expense Per Annum (a)   Fair Value of Financial Investments   Fair Value of Debt  2%  $ 196   $ 15   $ (1,059 )  $ (1,187 ) 1   98    8    (540 )   (633 ) (1)   (15 )   (6 )   541    730  (2)   nm    nm    1,075    1,579  ##TABLE_END nm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates has been floored at zero and does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2009, we had $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, MN February 10, 2010 ##TABLE_END  UnitedHealth Group Consolidated Balance Sheets ##TABLE_START   December 31,  (in millions, except per share data)  2009   2008  ASSETS   Current assets:   Cash and cash equivalents  $ 9,800   $ 7,426  Short-term investments   1,239    783  Accounts receivable, net of allowances of $220 and $148   1,954    1,929  Assets under management   2,383    2,199  Deferred income taxes   448    424  Other current receivables   1,838    1,715  Prepaid expenses and other current assets   538    514          Total current assets   18,200    14,990  Long-term investments   13,311    13,366  Property, equipment and capitalized software, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $2,738 and $2,363   2,140    2,181  Goodwill   20,727    20,088  Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $1,038 and $803   2,381    2,329  Other assets   2,286    2,861          TOTAL ASSETS  $ 59,045   $ 55,815          LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY   Current liabilities:   Medical costs payable  $ 9,362   $ 8,664  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   6,283    5,685  Other policy liabilities   3,137    2,823  Commercial paper and current maturities of long-term debt   2,164    1,456  Unearned revenues   1,217    1,133          Total current liabilities   22,163    19,761  Long-term debt, less current maturities   9,009    11,338  Future policy benefits   2,325    2,286  Other liabilities   1,942    1,650          Total liabilities   35,439    35,035          Commitments and contingencies (Note 14)   Shareholders equity:   Preferred stock, $0.001 par value  10 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding         Common stock, $0.01 par value  3,000 shares authorized; 1,147 and 1,201 issued and outstanding   11    12  Additional paid-in capital       38  Retained earnings   23,342    20,782  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):   Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax effects   277    (30 ) Foreign currency translation losses   (24 )   (22 )         Total shareholders equity   23,606    20,780          TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  $ 59,045   $ 55,815          ##TABLE_END See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (also referred to as UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to making health care work better. The Company emphasizes enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well-being of the people it serves and their communities. The Company helps people get the care they need at an affordable cost; supports the physician/patient relationship; and empowers people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. The Companys primary focus is on improving the health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery, promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care, and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to improve access to health and well-being services, simplify the health care experience, promote quality and make health care more affordable. 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 10, 2010, the date this Form 10-K was filed with the SEC. Other than the debt tender that is discussed in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the change to the Companys share repurchase program discussed in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, no material subsequent events have occurred since December 31, 2009 that required recognition or disclosure in these financial statements. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to medical costs, medical costs payable, revenues, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments, income taxes and contingent liabilities. These estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any changes in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. The Company recognizes premium revenues in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. The Company records health care premium payments received from its customers in advance of the service period as unearned revenues.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed based upon the fee charged to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependants, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. Since the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through the Companys Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized always exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized upon sale or shipment based on contract terms. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix publishing and software products that are recognized as revenue upon shipment. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which the Company has either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care professional contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates, and  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, the Companys operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The Company had checks outstanding in excess of bank deposits of $1.2 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, which were classified as Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have been reflected as Checks Outstanding within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its intent with respect to offsetting cash balances, which affected its balances in checks outstanding in excess of bank deposits for certain cash balances. There were no checks outstanding in excess of bank deposits as of December 31, 2007. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from earnings and reports them, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. The Company evaluates investments for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, the Company recognizes impairments in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the securitys cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company uses the specific cost or amortized cost of each investment sold. Assets Under Management The Company administers certain aspects of AARPs insurance program (see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP assets are managed separately  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the AARP contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with the AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Companys earnings. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmacy rebates, CMS for Medicare Part D, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its PBM businesses affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of Product Revenue. The Company generally receives rebates between two to five months after billing. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivables below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are six separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START   CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  ##TABLE_START   Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Policy Liabilities or Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and therefore are recorded as Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in Unearned Revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. The Company is fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to the Company. Amounts received for these subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amounts received for these subsidies were insufficient to cover the costs incurred for these contract elements; therefore, the Company recorded a receivable in Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in Medical Costs and Operating Costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2009 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2010, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2009  December 31, 2008 (in millions)  CMS Subsidies (a)  Risk-Share  CMS Subsidies (a)  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $ 271  $   $ 349  $ 19 Other policy liabilities      268       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Includes the Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  As of January 1, 2010, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START    The initial coverage limit increased to $2,830 from $2,700 in 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,440 as compared to $6,154 in 2009. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The annual out-of-pocket maximum increased to $4,550 from $4,350 in 2009. ##TABLE_END Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company reviews property, equipment and capitalized software for events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that we might not recover their carrying value. If the Company determines that an asset may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment  3 to 7 years Buildings  35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements  Shorter of useful life or remaining lease term Capitalized software  3 to 5 years ##TABLE_END Goodwill Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the Company performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. The Company calculates the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (includes significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The Company completed its annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2010 and determined that no impairment existed as of December 31, 2009. Although the Company believes that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of its reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms, as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long-term growth rate assumptions for some or all of its reporting units. Intangible assets Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., customer lists and trademarks). The Company does not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. The Company calculates the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. The Company considers many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP program (see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract above), and the current portion of future policy benefits. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivables Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation (Golden Rule) subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $139 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.9 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  December 31, 2008, the Company had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $154 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.9 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys commercial health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be cancelled by the customer with at least 31 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of commercial customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair values of the awards and is recognized as expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options and restricted stock, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Recent Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  a replacement of FAS 162. The new standard establishes only two levels of U.S. GAAP, authoritative and nonauthoritative. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became the single source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which will continue to be sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC became nonauthoritative upon adoption. The new guidance became effective for the Companys third quarter of 2009. Since the new standard did not change U.S. GAAP, there was no change to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements other than to update all references to U.S. GAAP to be in conformity with the ASC. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) as of January 1, 2008 for fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on at least an annual basis. The provisions were adopted for non-financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on at least an annual basis as of January 1, 2009. These provisions define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosure requirements. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance codified into ASC Topic No. 805, Business Combinations, which replaced previous business combination accounting guidance. The new guidance revises how an acquirer  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The guidance as amended includes recognition provisions for assets acquired and liabilities assumed that arise from contingencies and the treatment of contingent purchase price. It also requires additional disclosure requirements intended to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2009, and applied the provisions prospectively to all new acquisitions closing on or after that date. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the Companys fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13. The Company has determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to its operations. 3. Acquisitions On June 1, 2009, all of the outstanding shares of AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. (AIM) were acquired for approximately $440 million in cash. AIM is a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions for health care payer and hospital clients in all 50 states. On a preliminary basis, the total consideration paid exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $425 million, of which $166 million has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $259 million to goodwill. The allocation is pending completion of a valuation analysis. The acquired goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations and financial condition of AIM have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the Ingenix reporting segment since the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements were not material. On May 30, 2008, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government-sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. The total consideration paid exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $806 million, of which $89 million has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $717 million to goodwill. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits reporting segment since the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements were not material. On February 25, 2008, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. The total consideration paid exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $2.5 billion. Based on managements consideration of fair value, which included completion of a valuation analysis, $500 million has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $2.0 billion to goodwill. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of the Companys individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. The Company received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction, which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, the Company retained Sierras Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements were not material. On January 10, 2008, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and PBM services. The total consideration paid exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $752 million, of which $253 million has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $499 million to goodwill. The acquired goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements were not material. The finite-lived intangible assets and related weighted-average useful lives, by acquisition, as of acquisition date, consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   AIM  Unison  Sierra  Fiserv (in millions, except years)  Fair Value  Weighted- Average Useful Life  Fair Value  Weighted- Average Useful Life  Fair Value  Weighted- Average Useful Life  Fair Value  Weighted- Average Useful Life Customer Contracts and Membership Lists  $ 146  14 years  $ 41  6 years  $ 443  14 years  $ 252  12 years Trademarks   3  15 years   32  20 years   56  20 years   1  3 years Physician and Hospital Networks   17  5 years   16  20 years   1  15 years   n/a  n/a                     Total Acquired Finite-Lived Intangible Assets  $ 166  11 years  $ 89  9 years  $ 500  14 years  $ 253  12 years                     ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed for smaller acquisitions was $95 million, $94 million and $262 million, respectively. These acquisitions were not material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  4.

These investments are predominantly held in U.S. government or agency obligations. Additionally, the fair values of these investments approximate their amortized cost. ##TABLE_END The Companys mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position by credit rating distribution were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2009   December 31, 2008  (in millions)  Fair Value  Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value  Gross Unrealized Losses  AAA  $ 543  $ (6 )  $ 624  $ (105 ) AA   31   (2 )   1     A               BBB   1       13     Non-investment grade   2       1                   Total  $ 577  $ (8 )  $ 639  $ (105 )               ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The unrealized losses as of December 31, 2009 were generated from approximately 1,500 positions out of a total of approximately 12,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect all principal and interest due on all investments that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses on investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations and corporate obligations as of December 31, 2009 were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. The Company evaluates impairment at each reporting period for securities where the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The contractual cash flows of the U.S. government and agency obligations are guaranteed by either the U.S. government or an agency of the U.S. government. The Company expects that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Companys investment. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the state and municipal obligations and the corporate obligations, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). The unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities as of December 31, 2009 were primarily caused by higher interest rates in the marketplace, reflecting the higher perceived risk assigned by fixed-income investors to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). These unrealized losses represented less than 1% of the total amortized cost of the Companys mortgage-backed security holdings as of December 31, 2009. The Company believes these losses to be temporary. Approximately 94% of the Companys mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2009 were rated AAA with no known deterioration or other factors leading to an OTTI. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys holdings of non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities included $10 million of commercial mortgage loans in default. These investments were acquired in the first quarter of 2008 pursuant to an acquisition and were recorded at fair value. They represented less than 1% of the Companys total mortgage-backed security holdings as of December 31, 2009. A portion of the Companys investments in equity securities and venture capital funds consists of investments held in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care and related technology stocks will likewise impact the value of the Companys equity portfolio. The equity securities and venture capital funds were evaluated for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains, before taxes, were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,  (in millions)  2009   2008   2007  Total OTTI  $ (64 )  $ (121 )  $ (6 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       n/a    n/a              Net OTTI recognized in earnings   (64 )   (121 )   (6 ) Gross realized losses from sales   (41 )   (50 )   (13 ) Gross realized gains from sales   116    165    57              Net realized gains (losses)  $ 11   $ (6 )  $ 38              ##TABLE_END For 2009, all of the recorded OTTI resulted from the Companys intent to sell certain impaired securities.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  5. Fair Value Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, non-binding broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by its custodian, its investment consultant and third party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on the Companys internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, the Company has not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1  Quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START    Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, non-current prices, high variability over time, etc.); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, default rates, etc.); and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The following table presents information about the Companys financial assets, excluding AARP, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the valuation techniques the Company used to determine their fair values.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt Securities. The estimated fair values of debt securities held as available-for-sale are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Equity Securities. Equity securities are held as available-for-sale investments. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using market modeling approaches that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. These investments totaled $282 million as of December 31, 2009. The fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The key inputs utilized in the Companys market modeling include, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries and having similar revenue and growth characteristics; similar preferences in the capital structure; discounted cash flows; liquidation values and milestones established at initial funding; and the assumption that the values of the Companys venture capital investments can be inferred from these inputs. The Companys remaining Level 3 equity securities holdings of $30 million mainly consist of preferred stock for which there is no active market. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys interest rate swaps were estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available market yield curves. Because the swaps were unique and were not actively traded, the fair values were classified as Level 2 estimates. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs is as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2009   December 31, 2008  (in millions)  Debt Securities   Equity Securities   Total   Debt Securities  Equity Securities   Total  Balance at beginning of period  $ 62   $ 304   $ 366   $   $ 133   $ 133  Purchases, net   64    22    86    14   202    216  Net unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income       7    7       2    2  Net realized losses in investment and other income   (6 )   (21 )   (27 )      (54 )   (54 ) Transfers into Level 3               48   21    69                         Balance at end of period  $ 120   $ 312   $ 432   $ 62  $ 304   $ 366                         ##TABLE_END There were no significant fair value adjustments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records impairments. The table below includes fair values for certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. The carrying values and fair values of these financial instruments were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2009  December 31, 2008 (in millions)  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets     Debt securities  available-for-sale  $ 13,774  $ 13,774  $ 13,472  $ 13,472 Equity securities  available-for-sale   577   577   477   477 Debt securities  held-to-maturity   199   203   200   210 AARP program-related investments   2,114   2,114   1,941   1,941 Interest rate swaps         622   622 Liabilities     Senior unsecured notes   11,173   11,043   12,693   10,941 ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  In addition to the previously described methods and assumptions for debt and equity securities and interest rate swaps, the following are the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the other financial instruments: AARP Program-related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt and equity securities held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program (see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company elected to measure the AARP Assets Under Management, of which the investments are a part, at fair value, pursuant to the fair value option. See the preceding discussion regarding the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of debt and equity securities. Senior Unsecured Notes. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes are estimated based on third-party quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other current receivables, unearned revenue, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table above. 6.

Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. None of the factors discussed above were individually material to the net favorable medical cost development for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007.

For further discussion, see Long-Term Debt below. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (e) A portion of these notes has been classified with the current maturities of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 due to the debt tender offers discussed under Long-Term Debt below. ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Maturities of long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Maturities of Long-Term Debt 2010  $ 757 2011   985 2012   376 2013   954 2014   605 Thereafter   6,089 $1,095 million par, zero coupon senior unsecured notes due November 2022   558 Debt tender offers completed February 2010   849 ##TABLE_END Bank Credit Facilities In November 2008, the Company entered into a $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility. The Company terminated this facility on July 31, 2009 in advance of its maturity. There is currently $2.5 billion available under the Companys five-year revolving bank credit facility, which matures in May 2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.7%. This facility supports the Companys commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility. Long-Term Debt In February 2010, the Company completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding notes. The Company believes that this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and reduce its debt service cost. The Company used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. In February 2008, the Company issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of floating-rate notes due February 2011, $550 million of 4.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2013, $1.1 billion of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2018 and $1.1 billion of 6.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2038. The floating-rate notes are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had an interest rate of 1.6% as of December 31, 2009. In November 2007, the Company issued $500 million of zero coupon notes due November 2022. These zero coupon notes are original issue discount notes with an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of $1.1 billion and an accretion yield of 5.3%. These notes have a put feature that allows a note holder to require the Company to repurchase the notes at the accreted value at certain annual dates in the future, beginning on November 15, 2010; therefore, these notes have been classified with the current maturities of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009. In November 2007, the Company issued a total of $1.6 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of 5.1% fixed-rate notes due November 2010, $450 million of 5.5% fixed-rate notes due November 2012, $250 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due November 2017 and $650 million of 6.6% fixed-rate notes due November 2037. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act). In February 2008, the Company completed an exchange offer in which then-existing noteholders exchanged each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. In June 2007, the Company issued a total of $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $500 million of floating-rate notes due June 2010, $500 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due June 2017 and $500 million of 6.5% fixed-rate notes due June 2037. The floating-rate notes are benchmarked to LIBOR and had an interest rate of 0.4% as of December 31, 2009. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. In February 2008, the Company completed an exchange offer in which then-existing noteholders exchanged each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity, below 50%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Swap Contracts In January 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates. As of the swap contracts termination date, the cumulative adjustment to the carrying value of the Companys debt was $513 million, which is being amortized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years as a reduction to interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts. As of December 31, 2008, the fair values of the interest rate swaps were $622 million with $7 million classified in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets and $615 million classified in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 10. Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2009   2008   2007 Current Provision:    Federal  $ 1,924   $ 1,564   $ 2,284 State and local   78    145    166            Total current provision   2,002    1,709    2,450 Deferred provision   (16 )   (62 )   201            Total provision for income taxes  $ 1,986   $ 1,647   $ 2,651            ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. Federal Statutory Rate to the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)  2009   2008   2007  Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 2,033   35.0 %  $ 1,618   35.0 %  $ 2,557   35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   66   1.1    106   2.2    125   1.7  Settlement of state exams, net of federal benefit   (40 )  (0.7 )   (12 )  (0.2 )   (5 )    Tax-exempt investment income   (70 )  (1.2 )   (69 )  (1.5 )   (52 )  (0.7 ) Other, net   (3 )      4   0.1    26   0.3                       Provision for income taxes  $ 1,986   34.2 %  $ 1,647   35.6 %  $ 2,651   36.3 %                      ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  In 2009, the Company released tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters. Along with a change to an insurance premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which the Company operates, this decreased the Companys effective income tax rate in 2009. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2009   2008  Deferred income tax assets:   Share-based compensation  $ 419   $ 413  Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   218    223  Net operating loss carryforwards   206    213  Accrued expenses and allowances   201    93  Long term liabilities   164    354  Unearned revenues   58    56  Unrecognized tax benefits   55    100  Net unrealized losses on investments       15  Other   190    181          Subtotal   1,511    1,648  Less: valuation allowances   (198 )   (193 )         Total deferred income tax assets  $ 1,313   $ 1,455          Deferred income tax liabilities:   Intangible assets  $ (890 )  $ (885 ) Capitalized software development   (449 )   (439 ) Net unrealized gains on investments   (163 )     Prepaid expenses   (90 )     Depreciation and amortization   (80 )   (5 ) Interest rate swaps       (230 )         Total deferred income tax liabilities   (1,672 )   (1,559 )         Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (359 )  $ (104 )         ##TABLE_END Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain state net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $36 million expire beginning in 2012 through 2026, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2010 through 2028. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2009   2008  Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $ 340   $ 271  Gross increases:   Current year tax positions   10    14  Prior year tax positions   11    43  Acquired reserves       94  Gross decreases:   Prior year tax positions   (62 )   (29 ) Settlements   (61 )   (4 ) Statute of limitations lapses   (18 )   (49 )         Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $ 220   $ 340          ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The favorable resolution of historical state income tax matters resulted in a decrease in the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a net tax benefit of $7 million generated from the reduction in interest accrued from the release of previously accrued tax matters. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $23 million of net interest expense. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $44 million and $65 million, respectively, of accrued interest for uncertain tax positions, which were reported in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $101 million. The Company currently files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2007 and prior. The Companys 2008 and 2009 tax returns are under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to 2003 in major state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not believe any adjustments that may result from these examinations will be significant. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $92 million or less as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. 11. Shareholders Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. The increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in 2009 primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing, as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels. As of December 31, 2009, $2.3 billion of the Companys $24.4 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated entities. The Companys regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $10 billion as of December 31, 2009, which exceeds aggregate minimum regulatory requirements.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program (Repurchase Program). The objectives of the Repurchase Program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. During 2009, the Company repurchased 74.3 million shares at an average price of approximately $24 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 28.7 million shares of its common stock. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased the Companys share repurchase program, and authorized the Company to repurchase up to 120 million shares of its common stock. 12. Share-Based Compensation and Other Employee Benefit Plans The Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan), as amended and restated May 15, 2002, is intended to attract and retain employees and non-employee directors, offer them incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Companys business and afford them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The Plan allows the Company to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards or other stock-based awards to eligible employees and non-employee directors. The Plan incorporates the following prior plans: 1991 Stock and Incentive Plan, 1998 Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan. All outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other awards issued under the prior plans shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of these plans under which they were issued. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 63.5 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), and up to 15.3 million of awards in restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares). The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. Stock Options and SARs Stock options and SARs generally vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START   Shares   Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value   (in thousands)     (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding, beginning of period  150,752   $ 36   Granted  15,026    30   Exercised  (19,421 )   13   Forfeited  (22,211 )   34           Outstanding, end of period  124,146   $ 39  5.5  $ 304         Exercisable, end of period  87,664   $ 39  4.4  $ 287 Vested and expected to vest at end of period  118,962   $ 39  5.3  $ 302 ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  To determine compensation expense related to the Companys stock options and SARs, the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. For purposes of estimating the fair value of the Companys employee stock option and SAR grants, the Company uses a binomial model. The principal assumptions the Company used in applying the option-pricing models were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2009  2008  2007 Risk free interest rate  1.7% - 2.4%  2.2% - 3.4%  3.8% - 5.2% Expected volatility  41.3% - 46.8%  29.5%  24.2% Expected dividend yield  0.1%  0.1%  0.1% Forfeiture rate  5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years  4.4 - 5.1  4.3  4.1 ##TABLE_END Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Beginning in 2009, the Company changed the weighting of historical and implied volatilities used in the calculation of expected volatility to 90% and 10%, respectively. Before the change, the Company had weighted historical and implied volatility equally. Due to the significant economic turbulence and resulting instability of the exchange-traded options throughout 2008, the Company concluded that they were no longer as representative of the fair value of its common stock over the expected life of its options and SARs. The change had no impact on the Companys reported Net Earnings nor Earnings per Share. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and SARs granted for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $10 per share, $9 per share and $14 per share. The total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $282 million, $244 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Restricted Shares Restricted shares generally vest ratably over two to five years. Compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in thousands)  Shares   Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested, Beginning of Period  6,282   $ 36 Granted  6,587    29 Vested  (1,655 )   29 Forfeited  (594 )   34       Nonvested, End of Period  10,620   $ 33       ##TABLE_END The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $29 per share, $34 per share and $51 per share, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $47 million, $17 million and $35 million, respectively.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is intended to enhance employee commitment to the goals of the Company, by providing a means of achieving stock ownership at advantageous terms to eligible employees of the Company. Eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, 3.7 million shares, 2.9 million shares and 1.9 million shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP. The compensation expense is included in the compensation expense amounts recognized and discussed below. As of December 31, 2009, there were 9.3 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Share-Based Compensation Recognition The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, SARs and restricted shares, on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Beginning with share-based awards granted in 2009, the Companys equity award program includes a retirement provision that treats all employees who are age 55 or older with at least ten years of recognized employment with the Company as retirement-eligible. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized compensation expense related to its share-based compensation plans of $334 million ($220 million net of tax effects), $305 million ($202 million net of tax effects) and $505 million ($325 million net of tax effects), respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recognized in Operating Costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2009, there was $490 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, the income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises was $94 million, $106 million and $399 million, respectively. Included in the share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 is $176 million ($112 million net of tax benefit) of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to the Companys historical stock option practices. As part of its review of the Companys historical stock option practices, the Company determined that certain stock options granted to individuals who were nonexecutive officer employees at the time of grant were granted with an exercise price that was lower than the closing price of the Companys common stock on the applicable accounting measurement date, subjecting these individuals to additional tax under Section 409A. The Company elected to pay these individuals for the additional tax costs relating to such stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007. For any outstanding stock options subject to additional tax under Section 409A that were granted to nonexecutive officer employees, the Company increased the exercise price and committed to make cash payments to these optionholders for their vested options based on the difference between the original stock option price and the revised increased stock option price. Payments of $142 million were made from January 2008 through January 2010 for options vested through December 31, 2009. If the modified stock options are subsequently exercised, the Company will recover these cash payments at that time from exercise proceeds at the revised increased stock option exercise prices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expense ($55 million net of tax benefit) for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expense ($57 million net of tax benefit) for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. These amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  As further discussed in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure, cost of capital and return to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued for share-based award exercises. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for all employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not significant for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company has provided Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) benefits, which are non-qualified defined benefit plans, for its CEO, as well as for certain nonexecutive officers under plans that were assumed in acquisitions. No additional amounts are accruing to the SERP for the Companys CEO. The SERPs are non-contributory, unfunded and provide benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment. The total SERP liability as of December 31, 2009 was $20 million, which was recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total SERP liability as of December 31, 2008 was $159 million, of which $51 million was recorded in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities and $108 million was recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2009, a SERP accrual of $91 million relating to the Companys former CEO was reversed as a result of the resolution of the SEC settlement pertaining to the stock option matter. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of stock option matters. In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within Long-Term Investments with an approximately equal amount in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $216 million and $182 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 13. AARP The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the Program), and separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. In October 2007, the Company entered into four agreements with AARP, effective January 1, 2008, that amended its existing AARP arrangements. These agreements extended the Companys arrangements with AARP on the Program to December 31, 2017, extended the Companys arrangement with AARP on the Medicare Part D business to December 31, 2014, and gave the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Companys Medicare Advantage offerings until December 31, 2014, subject to certain limited exclusions. Under the Program, the Company is compensated for transaction processing and other services, as well as for assuming underwriting risk. The Company is also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings. Premium revenues from the Companys portion of the Program for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $6.0 billion, $5.7 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The Companys agreement with AARP on the Program provides for the maintenance of the Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) that is held by the Company on behalf of policyholders. Underwriting gains or losses related to the  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. The RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the RSF are reported in Medical Costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2008, $127 million in cash was transferred out of the RSF to an external insurance entity that offers an AARP branded age 50 to 64 comprehensive insurance product. The Company believes the RSF balance as of December 31, 2009 is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract. The effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under the Companys agreement with AARP, the Company separately manages the assets that support the Program. These assets are held at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Assets Under Management. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by the Program and are used to pay costs associated with the Program. The Company does not guarantee any rates of investment return on these investments and upon any transfer of the Program to another entity, the Company would transfer cash in an amount equal to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF and, thus, are not included in the Companys earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the AARP RSF and were $99 million, $82 million and $108 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company elected to measure the entirety of the AARP Assets Under Management at fair value, pursuant to the fair value option. The following AARP Program-related assets and liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  December 31, 2009  December 31, 2008 Accounts receivable  $ 509  $ 482 Assets under management   2,383   2,199 Other assets      7 Medical costs payable   1,182   1,160 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   40   52 Other policy liabilities   1,145   1,047 Future policy benefits   482   429 Other liabilities   43    ##TABLE_END  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  The fair value of cash, cash equivalents and investments associated with the Program, reflected as Assets Under Management, and the fair value of Other Assets and Other Liabilities were classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value December 31, 2009     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 269  $   $   $ 269 Debt securities:     U.S. government and agency obligations   358   298      656 State and municipal obligations      9      9 Corporate obligations      955      955 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      343      343 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      149      149             Total debt securities   358   1,754      2,112             Equity securities  available-for-sale      2      2             Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value  $ 627  $ 1,756  $   $ 2,383             Other liabilities  $   $   $ 43  $ 43             Total liabilities at fair value  $   $   $ 43  $ 43             December 31, 2008     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 240  $ 18  $   $ 258 Debt securities:     U.S. government and agency obligations   291   293      584 State and municipal obligations      6      6 Corporate obligations      786      786 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      421      421 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      142      142             Total debt securities   291   1,648      1,939             Equity securities  available-for-sale      2      2             Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value   531   1,668      2,199             Other assets         7   7             Total assets at fair value  $ 531  $ 1,668  $ 7  $ 2,206             ##TABLE_END 14. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities, computer hardware and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2028. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $303 million, $264 million and $223 million, respectively.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  As of December 31, 2009, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all noncancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments 2010  $ 255 2011   221 2012   199 2013   152 2014   120 Thereafter   644 ##TABLE_END The Company contracts on an administrative services only (ASO) basis with customers who fund their own claims. The Company charges these customers administrative fees based on the expected cost of administering their self-funded programs. In some cases, the Company provides performance guarantees related to its administrative function. If these standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. Amounts accrued for performance guarantees were not material as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $62 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $247 million, primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the design and management of its service offerings. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to certain business practices. Litigation Matters MDL Litigation. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against the Company by health care providers alleging various claims relating to the Companys reimbursement practices, including alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) and state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims. Many of these lawsuits were consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District Court of Florida (MDL). In the lead MDL lawsuit, the court certified a class of health care providers for certain of the RICO claims. In 2006, the trial court dismissed all of the claims against the Company in the lead MDL lawsuit, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed that dismissal, leaving eleven related lawsuits that had been stayed during the litigation of the lead MDL lawsuit. In August 2008, the trial court, applying its rulings in the lead MDL lawsuit, dismissed seven of the 11 related lawsuits, and all but one claim in an eighth lawsuit. The plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals to the Eleventh Circuit. The trial court ordered the final claim in the eighth lawsuit to arbitration. In December 2008, at the plaintiffs request, the trial court dismissed without prejudice one of the three remaining lawsuits. The court also denied the plaintiffs request to remand the remaining two lawsuits to state court and a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissal of those suits. On April 16, 2009, the plaintiffs in these last two suits filed amended class action complaints alleging breach of contract. In addition, the Company is party to a number of arbitrations in various jurisdictions involving similar claims. The Company is vigorously defending against the remaining claims in these cases.  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  AMA Litigation. On March 15, 2000, a group of plaintiffs including the American Medical Association (AMA) filed a lawsuit against the Company in state court in New York, which was removed to federal court. The complaint and subsequent amended complaints asserted antitrust claims and claims based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network health care providers by the Companys affiliates. On January 14, 2009, after almost nine years of litigation and many rulings from the court on various motions, the parties announced an agreement to settle the lawsuit, along with a similar case filed in 2008 in federal court in New Jersey. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company and its affiliated entities will be released from claims relating to their out-of-network reimbursement policies from March 15, 1994 through the date of final court approval of the settlement. The Company will pay a total of $350 million to fund the settlement for health plan members and out-of-network providers in connection with out-of-network procedures performed since March 15, 1994. The agreement contains no admission of wrongdoing. The proposed settlement is subject to final court approval. In addition, the Company has the right to terminate the settlement if a certain number of class members elect to opt-out of the settlement. A splinter group of plaintiffs counsel is challenging the proposed settlement. The court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement over the objections of certain plaintiffs counsel on December 1, 2009, and a final approval hearing following notice to members of the class is scheduled for July 2010. Other lawsuits in various jurisdictions relating to the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network health care providers remain pending against a number of health insurers, including the Company. NYAG Investigation. On February 13, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (NYAG) announced that it was conducting an industry-wide investigation into out-of-network provider reimbursement practices of health insurers, including the Company, and served the Company with a notice of intent to initiate litigation. On January 13, 2009, the Company announced it had reached an agreement with the NYAG regarding the investigation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay $50 million to fund a not-for-profit entity to develop and own a new, independent database product to replace the Prevailing Health Charges System (PHCS) and Medical Data Research (MDR) database products owned by Ingenix, Inc. Both products are used by a number of health plans and employers as tools that help determine the amount to reimburse members who receive physician services outside their managed care networks. When the new database product is ready, the Company will cease using the PHCS and MDR databases and will use the new database for a period of at least five years in connection with out-of-network reimbursement in those benefit plans that employ a reasonable and customary standard for out-of-network reimbursements. On October 2, 2009, the Company paid the $50 million required under the settlement agreement into an account designated by the NYAG. Following the announcement of the NYAG settlement, the Company received inquiries from a number of state and federal regulators, including the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, regarding out-of-network reimbursement practices of health insurers. California Claims Processing Matter. As previously disclosed, in 2007, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) examined the Companys PacifiCare health insurance plan in California. The examination findings related to the timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, provider contract implementation, provider dispute resolution, and other related matters. On January 25, 2008, the CDI issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations in connection with the CDIs examination findings. On June 3, 2009, the Company filed a Notice of Defense to the Order to Show Cause denying all material allegations and asserting certain defenses. The matter is now the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge. Historical Stock Option Practices. In 2006, a consolidated shareholder derivative action, captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Shareholder Derivative Litigation was filed against certain of the Companys  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The consolidated amended complaint was brought on behalf of the Company by several pension funds and other shareholders and named certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The consolidated amended complaint generally alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, were unjustly enriched, and violated the securities laws in connection with the Companys historical stock option practices. On June 26, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee under Minnesota Statute 302A.241, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, with the power to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and shareholder demands and determine whether the Companys rights and remedies should be pursued. A consolidated derivative action, captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Derivative Litigation , was also filed in Hennepin County District Court, State of Minnesota. The action was brought by two individual shareholders and named certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. On December 6, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee concluded its review of claims relating to the Companys historical stock option practices and published a report. The Special Litigation Committee reached settlement agreements on behalf of the Company with its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William W. McGuire, M.D., former General Counsel David J. Lubben, and former director William G. Spears. In addition, the Special Litigation Committee concluded that all claims against all named defendants in the derivative actions, including current and former Company officers and directors, should be dismissed. Each settlement agreement is conditioned upon dismissal of claims in the derivative actions and resolution of any appeals. Following notice to shareholders, the federal court granted the parties motion for final approval of the proposed settlements on July 1, 2009, and entered final judgment dismissing the federal case with prejudice on July 2, 2009. The state court granted the parties motion for final approval of the proposed settlements and dismissed the state case with prejudice on May 14, 2009, and entered final judgment on July 17, 2009. The federal and state courts also awarded plaintiffs counsel fees and expenses of $30 million and $6 million, respectively, which have been paid by the Company. A shareholder has filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit challenging only the federal plaintiffs counsels fee award. Federal plaintiffs counsel is contesting the appeal. As previously disclosed, the Company also received inquiries from a number of federal and state regulators from 2006 through 2008 regarding its historical stock option practices. Many of those inquiries have been closed, resolved or inactive since 2008. The Company may be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings or actions arising out of the Companys historical stock option practices and the related restatement of its historical Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation and any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of the Companys business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Government Regulation The Companys business is regulated at federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing the Companys business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues as the subject of proposed legislation. In connection with these activities, the Company periodically receives inquiries and requests for information from state or federal legislative bodies. For instance, during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company received requests for information and  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  testimony from Congressional committees in connection with health care reform legislative proposals. The Company is cooperating with these requests. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how the Company does business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase the Companys health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase the Companys liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. Further, the Company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market and sell many of its products. The Company has been and is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor and other governmental authorities. Examples of audits include a review by the U.S. Department of Labor of the Companys administration of applicable customer employee benefit plans with respect to ERISA compliance and audits of the Companys Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by its care providers. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. The coding audits may result in prospective and retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to CMS Medicare contracts. 15. Segment Financial Information Factors used in determining the Companys reporting segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision-maker to evaluate its results of operations. The Companys accounting policies for reporting segment operations are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reporting segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reporting segment has at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital or working capital for non-regulated businesses. Substantially all of the Companys assets are held and operations are conducted in the United States. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, reporting segments with similar economic characteristics may be combined. The financial results of UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been aggregated in the Health Benefits segment column in the following tables because these businesses have similar economic characteristics and have similar products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and operate in a similar regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including the Companys contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 27% for the year ended December 31, 2009, and 25% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 most of which were generated by Ovations and included in the Health Benefits segment.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2009. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2009 The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_START /s/ STEPHEN J.

Rangen Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer ##TABLE_END February 10, 2010  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2009. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of the Company and our reports dated February 10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, MN February 10, 2010 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, whose focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system (the terms we, our, us UnitedHealth Group or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and our subsidiaries). We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost; support the physician/patient relationship; and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. During 2010, we managed approximately $125 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the constituents and consumers we served across our various businesses. Our primary focus is on improving the health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery, promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care, and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to help make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual (formerly UnitedHealthcare), UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement (formerly Ovations), and UnitedHealthcare Community  State (formerly AmeriChoice) businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from consumers, employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well-being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. We have four reporting segments: ##TABLE_START   Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Ingenix; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Prescription Solutions. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, see Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 Business Realignment On January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, in 2011 OptumHealths results of operations will include our clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi-specialty clinics in  Nevada and our Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals results of operations will include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. There were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes. Our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment. Additional Information UnitedHealth Group Incorporated was incorporated in January 1977 in Minnesota. Our executive offices are located at UnitedHealth Group Center, 9900 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343; our telephone number is (952) 936-1300.

DESCRIPTION OF REPORTING SEGMENTS Health Benefits The financial results of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community  State have been aggregated in the Health Benefits reporting segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, types of customers, distribution methods, operational processes and regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. Health Benefits utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as prescription drug services, behavioral health services and fraud and abuse prevention and detection. Health Benefits arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include a total of 730,000 physicians and other health care professionals and 5,300 hospitals across the United States. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual facilitated access to health care services on behalf of approximately 25 million Americans as of December 31, 2010. With its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year  period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependants, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides coordination and facilitation of medical services, customer and health care professional services and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Large employer groups, such as those serviced by UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts, typically use self-funded arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts served 372 large employer groups under these arrangements, including 144 of the Fortune 500 companies. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or able to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third party administrators (TPAs). UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals product strategy centers on several principles: consumer choice, broad access to health professionals, and use of data and science to promote better outcomes, quality service, transparency and affordability. Integrated wellness programs and services help individuals make informed decisions, maintain healthy lifestyles and optimize health outcomes by coordinating access to care services and providing personalized, targeted education and information services.

OptumHealth is one brand, organized into four major operating groups: OptumHealth Care Solutions; OptumHealth Financial Services; OptumHealth Behavioral Solutions; and OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, whose results of operations will be reflected in UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual in 2011.

Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting and actuarial services, business process outsourcing services and pharmaceutical data consulting and research services in conjunction with the development of pharmaceutical products on a nationwide and international basis. As of December 31, 2010, Ingenixs customer base included 6,200 hospital facilities, 246,000 health care professionals or groups, 2,000 payers and intermediaries, 205 Fortune 500 companies, 2,200 life sciences companies, 270 government entities, and 150 United Kingdom Government Payers, as well as other UnitedHealth Group businesses. Ingenix offers information and technology to simplify health care administration. Ingenix helps customers accurately and efficiently manage the information flowing through the health care system. Ingenix uses data to help advance transparency on cost and quality and help customers streamline their processes to make health care more efficient. Ingenix is a leader in contract research services, and pharmacoeconomics, epidemiology and safety and outcomes (including comparative effectiveness) research through its i3 businesses. Ingenixs products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force focused on specific customers and market segments across the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, employer, government, hospital, physician, payer and property and casualty insurance market segments. Ingenixs products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliance and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface its products with their applications.  Many of Ingenixs contract research services, consulting arrangements and software and related information services are performed over an extended period, often several years. Ingenix maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. Ingenixs aggregate backlog at December 31, 2010 was $2.8 billion, of which $2.0 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $0.8 billion related to intersegment agreements all of which are included in the current portion. Backlog amounts do not include approximately $500 million for the portion of the i3 business that is being divested, which is discussed below. Ingenix cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation or early termination of service arrangements. The Ingenix companies are divided into two groups: Information Services and i3. Information Services. Information Services diverse product offerings help clients strengthen health care administration and advance health care outcomes. These products include health care utilization reporting and analytics, physician clinical performance benchmarking, clinical data warehousing, analysis and management responses for medical cost trend management, physician practice revenue cycle management, including integrated electronic medical record systems, revenue and payment cycle management for payer and health care professional organizations, payment accuracy solutions, decision-support portals for evaluation of health benefits and treatment options, risk management solutions, connectivity solutions and claims management tools to reduce administrative errors and support fraud recovery services. Information Services uses proprietary software applications that manage clinical and administrative data across diverse information technology environments. Information Services also uses proprietary predictive algorithmic applications to help clients detect and act on repetitive health care patterns in large data sets. Information Services offers comprehensive Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) services helping health care professionals and payers decrease costs of claims transmission, payment and reimbursement through both networked and direct connection services. Information Services provides computer assisted coding, publishes print and electronic media products that provide customers with information regarding medical claims coding, reimbursement, billing and compliance issues. Information Services provides other services, such as medical necessity compliance services, verification of physician credentials, health care professional directories, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) reporting, and fraud and abuse detection and prevention services. Information Services also offers consulting services, including actuarial and financial advisory work through its Ingenix Consulting division and health care policy research, implementation, strategy and management consulting through its subsidiary, The Lewin Group, as well as product development, health care professional contracting and medical policy management. i3. i3 uses comprehensive, science-based evaluation and analysis and benchmarking services to support pharmaceutical and biotechnology development. i3 provides services on a nationwide and international basis, helping customers effectively and efficiently get drug data to appropriate regulatory bodies and to improve health outcomes through integrated information, analysis and technology. i3s capabilities and efforts focus on the entire range of product assessment, through commercialization of life-cycle management services  pipeline assessment, market access and product positioning, clinical trials, economic, epidemiology and safety and outcomes (including comparative effectiveness) research. i3s global contract research services include regulatory assistance, project management, data management, biostatistical analysis, quality assurance, medical writing and staffing resource services. i3s contract research services are therapeutically focused on oncology, the central nervous system, respiratory, infectious and pulmonary diseases and endocrinology. In January 2011, we announced that as part of focusing on its distinct life sciences competencies, Ingenix is exiting certain portions of the clinical trial support business and intends to sell these businesses. The businesses to be sold include those that mainly provide services in connection with the clinical trials that help pharmaceutical companies get a compound approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and other  applicable drug regulatory agencies outside of the United States. The services provided include monitoring, project management, data management and clinical staffing services. These services are generally performed in connection with Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. The remaining portion of i3 will be organized into a new Life Sciences division that will focus Ingenixs capabilities in assisting life sciences clients to identify, analyze and measure the value of their products that have received regulatory approval. The products and services provided by the Life Sciences division include health economics outcomes and late phase research, market access and reimbursement informatics products and services, epidemiology and certain drug safety services, products and services relating to patient reported outcomes and regulatory consulting services. Prescription Solutions Prescription Solutions provides a comprehensive suite of integrated pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services to more than 12 million people nationwide through its network of more than 66,000 retail pharmacies and two mail service facilities, processing nearly 350 million adjusted retail, mail service and specialty drug prescriptions annually.

Prescription Solutions provides PBM services to customers in our Health Benefits segment, as well as external employer groups, union trusts, managed care organizations, Medicare-contracted plans, Medicaid plans and TPAs, including mail service only, rebate services only and pharmacy carve-out accounts. Prescription Solutions distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants or direct sales. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Health Reform Legislation, were signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation, portions of which are summarized below, alters the regulatory environment in which we operate, in some cases to a significant degree. Federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, could negatively affect our business. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws, regulations and rules. In the event we fail to comply with, or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations  and rules, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Health Care Reforms The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect, and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Treasury Department have issued regulations (or proposed regulations) on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation. Certain aspects of the Health Reform Legislation are also being challenged in federal court, with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the Health Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. For example, on January 31, 2011, in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general and/or governors and certain other parties, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida ruled that the provision in the Health Reform Legislation that requires individuals to purchase health insurance (or be subject to penalties), along with the entire legislation, is unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has held that the individual mandate and certain related provisions are unconstitutional, but without declaring the entire legislation unconstitutional. In contrast, federal district court judges in Virginia and Michigan have upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the Health Reform Legislation. There are other cases challenging aspects of the Health Reform Legislation that remain pending and have not yet been decided. Judicial proceedings are subject to appeal and could last for an extended period of time, and we cannot predict the results of any of these proceedings. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Reform Legislation, or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether. The following outlines certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation that have taken or will take effect in the coming years, assuming the legislation is implemented in its current form. Effective 2010 : The Health Reform Legislation mandated the expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age 26; eliminated certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of certain essential health benefits; eliminated pre-existing condition limits for enrollees under 19; prohibited certain policy rescissions; prohibited plans and issuers from charging higher cost sharing (copayments or coinsurance) for emergency services that are obtained out of a plans network; and included a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members (for non-grandfathered plans). The Health Reform Legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes, including expanding the definition of adverse benefit determination to include rescissions; extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and self-funded plans; requiring urgent care coverage determinations to be made and communicated within 24 hours; and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices. Effective 2011 : Beginning in 2011, commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations) will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Rebate payments, if any, for 2011 would be made in mid 2012. A state can request a waiver of the individual market medical loss ratio for up to three years if the state petitions and provides to HHS certain supporting data, and HHS determines that the requirement is disruptive to the market in that state. In addition, effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs and 7% on generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap.  In addition, the Health Reform Legislation required HHS to maintain an annual review process of unreasonable increases in premiums for commercial health plans. HHS recently issued a proposed regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% for rate increases filed or effective July 1, 2011 or later. The proposed rule also clarifies that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any premium rate increase of 10% or more, regardless of whether such increase ultimately is or is not deemed unreasonable. This information is expected to be made public by the states and/or HHS. Effective 2011/2012 : As part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect (plans will ultimately receive 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. In addition to other measures, quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated rate reductions as CMS quality rating bonuses are phased in over three years beginning in 2012. Effective 2013 : Effective beginning in 2013 with respect to services performed after 2009, the Health Reform Legislation limits the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for insurance providers if at least 25% of the insurance providers gross premium income from health business is derived from health insurance plans that meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements. Effective 2013/2014 : The Health Reform Legislation provides for an increase in Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care program reimbursements for primary care services provided by primary care doctors (family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine) to 100% of the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014, and provides 100% federal financing for the difference in rates based on rates applicable on July 1, 2009. Effective 2014 : Effective starting in 2014, a number of the provisions of the Health Reform Legislation are scheduled to take effect, including the following: an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes; expansion of Medicaid eligibility for all individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (states can early adopt the expansion without increased federal funding prior to 2014); states receive full federal matching in 2014 through 2016; all individual and group health plans must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis during annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods and cannot apply pre-existing condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments; elimination of annual limits on essential benefits coverage on certain plans; establishment of state-based exchanges for individuals and small employers (with up to 100 employees) as well as certain CHIP eligibles; introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values to increase comparability of competing products on the exchanges; and establishment of minimum medical loss ratio of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. The Health Reform Legislation may create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth, but due to its complexity, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the Health Reform Legislation and related matters.  Other Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of federal regulation. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as certain aspects of our OptumHealth business. CMS has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to Medicare beneficiaries. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of audits of our risk adjustment data for several of our plans. Our Health Benefits reporting segment, through UnitedHealthcare Community  State, also has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations surrounding Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the Health Reform Legislation. When we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. In addition, certain of Ingenixs businesses, such as its high acuity software products and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the United States that regulate clinical trials. Laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust also affect us. HIPAA, GLBA and Other Privacy and Security Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. HIPAA requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals. It also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. Federal regulations related to HIPAA include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us. Federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation, regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation. For example, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which significantly amends, and adds new, privacy and security provisions to HIPAA and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information. AARA includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. HHS has indicated that it will issue regulations this year on key aspects of HIPAA, primarily ARRA amendments to HIPAA. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with HIPAA, GLBA and other privacy-related regulations. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of  laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the DOL as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. Additionally, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third-party claims administration services for health care plans. FDIC. The FDIC has federal regulatory authority over OptumHealth Bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the FDIC performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable federal banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, governmental oversight and monetary penalties. Financial Reform. Our business may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which became law on July 21, 2010. The act reshapes and restructures the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry. The act calls for extensive rulemaking, including debit card interchange fees restrictions, and network exclusivity and routing requirements. Depending on rulemaking and implementation activities, the act could subject us to additional regulation, increase operational costs and reduce revenue. The full impact of the law and future regulations on our results of operations and business strategy may not be known for some time. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. With the amendment of the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to adopt elements substantially similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. In addition, the states were very active in 2010 and passed various laws to implement, limit and, in the majority of instances, expand the entitlements set forth in the federal Health Reform Legislation. We expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2011, and this will affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. In addition, some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, managed care organization (MCO), utilization review (UR) or third-party administrator-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Our UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement  Medicaid businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits by UnitedHealthcare Community  State to its Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement to its dually-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states), including those issuing health (which includes long-term care), life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of a matter involving Penn Treaty Network American Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), which have been placed in rehabilitation. Pharmacy Regulation. Prescription Solutions mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. Privacy and Security Laws. States have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the GLBA. Like HIPAA, GLBA allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. A number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy-related regulations. UDFI. The Utah State Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) has state regulatory and supervisory authority over OptumHealth Bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the UDFI in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, governmental oversight and monetary penalties.  Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain businesses within OptumHealth are subject to laws and regulations that may differ from those that apply to our businesses of providing managed care and health insurance products. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine or exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. Additionally, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. These laws, regulations and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Audits and Investigations We have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. DOL, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation, audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business. International Regulation Some of our business units have international operations. These international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, including various tax, tariff and trade regulations, as well as employment, intellectual property, privacy and investment rules and laws. These international operations are also subject to United States laws that regulate activities of U.S.-based businesses abroad. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our Health Benefits businesses, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our Prescription Solutions businesses, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.  EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 87,000 individuals. We believe our employee relations are generally positive.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, plan, project, should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. If we fail to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, the profitability of our risk-based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, the Health Reform Legislation requires HHS to maintain an annual review process of unreasonable increases in premiums for commercial health plans, and states have a variety of premium review and approval processes that are receiving increased scrutiny. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period; however, medical cost inflation, regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly  treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2010 would have been reduced by approximately $190 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, they will have a negative impact on our future results. Our business activities are highly regulated; new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, in the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law, legislating broad-based changes to the U.S. health care system. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation for a discussion of the Health Reform Legislation. The broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business, as well as future laws and rules, and interpretation of those laws and rules by governmental enforcement authorities, could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. For example, in October 2008 Congress enacted the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA), which requires insurers to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits under terms that are no more restrictive than those applied to medical and surgical benefits. The MHPAEA specifically directed the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury to issue regulations to implement the legislation. Although regulations regarding how the MHPAEA was to be implemented were issued on February 2, 2010 in the form of an interim final rule, final regulations have not yet been published and interpretative guidance from the regulators has been limited to date. Because of the broad range of treatment limitations to which parity is expected to apply under the regulations, the regulations will likely lead to an increase in the costs associated with both insured and self-insured plans for behavioral health benefits and services and impact our market for carve-out health benefit administration, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of certain acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states), including those issuing health (which includes long-term care), life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof, or insolvency by another insurer, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of a matter involving Penn Treaty, which has been placed in rehabilitation. Certain OptumHealth businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our businesses of providing managed care and health insurance products. For example, the businesses are subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws and regulations, such as those that govern  so-called corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, which govern their relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. Additionally, our financial services business may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which became law on July 21, 2010. The act calls for extensive rulemaking, including debit card interchange fees restrictions, and network exclusivity and routing requirements, and depending on rulemaking and implementation activities, could subject us to additional regulation, increase operational costs and reduce revenue. We are also involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These regulatory activities include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. For example, in 2007, the California Department of Insurance examined our PacifiCare health insurance plan in California. The examination findings related to the timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, provider contract implementation, provider dispute resolution and other related matters. The matter is now the subject of an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of this matter. See also the risk factor below relating to our activities as a payer in various government health care programs for a discussion of audits of data used in determining CMS payment rates. Reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity, including negative publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations or the political environment, may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets and result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products and services, or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. For a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses, see Item 1, Business  Government Regulation. The enactment or implementation of health care reforms could materially adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our revenues, financial position and results of operations. In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs and CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, establishes minimum medical loss ratios, creates a federal premium review process, imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits, or EOBs) between health insurers and their members, grants to members new and additional appeal rights, imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, reduces the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage.  Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect, and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued regulations (or proposed regulations) on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation. Due to the complexity of the Health Reform Legislation, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. For example, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations). Companies with medical loss ratios below these targets will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Depending on the results of the calculation and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of this requirement, there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets, and our market share, revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Health Reform Legislation requires the establishment of state-based health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014. The types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state, the availability of federal premium subsidies within exchanges, the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges, and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges, could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our revenues, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Several of the provisions in the Health Reform Legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends. Examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices, annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers, enhanced coverage requirements and the prohibition of pre-existing condition exclusions. The annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes, will increase our operating costs. Premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs. These premium increases are oftentimes subject to state regulatory approval, and, as required under the Health Reform Legislation, HHS recently issued proposed rules that, if implemented, would establish a federal premium rate review process for annual premium rate increases, generally of 10% or more. If we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that become active under the Health Reform Legislation in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 32 million new individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the Health Reform Legislation is implemented broadly in its current form. In addition, we expect that implementation of the Health Reform Legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our Health Services businesses. We have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based, in part, on these assumptions, and our results of operations or financial position could be adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the Health Reform Legislation than estimated or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our Health Benefits offerings, or if the demand for our Health Services businesses does not increase. Certain aspects of the Health Reform Legislation are also being challenged in federal court, with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the Health Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. For example, on January 31, 2011, in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general and/or governors and certain other parties, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida ruled that the provision in the Health Reform Legislation that requires individuals to purchase health insurance (or be subject to penalties), along with the entire legislation, is unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has held that the individual mandate and certain related provisions are unconstitutional, but without declaring the entire legislation unconstitutional. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Reform Legislation, or may attempt to replace the legislation with  amended provisions or repeal it altogether. Any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties, or uncertainty regarding such events, could adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Health Reform Legislation or may cause us to incur additional costs of compliance. For example, if the individual mandate is declared unconstitutional without corresponding changes to other provisions of the Health Reform Legislation to protect against the risk of adverse selection (such as revisions to the guaranteed issue and renewal requirements, prohibition on pre-existing condition exclusions, and rating restrictions), our financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Congress is also considering additional health care reform measures, and a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets. The effects of the Health Reform Legislation and recently adopted state laws, and the regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder, are difficult to predict, and we cannot predict whether any other federal or state proposals will ultimately become law. Such laws and rules could force us to materially change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, change the nature of our contracted network relationships, increase our medical and administrative costs and capital requirements, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, our market share, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and our cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation, see Item 1, Business  Government Regulation and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Executive Overview  Business Trends  Health Care Reforms. As a payer in various government health care programs, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive revenues from these programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. For example, in 2009, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010, and as part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect, with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. As part of the Health Reform Legislation, CMS has developed a system whereby plans that meet certain quality ratings will be entitled to various quality bonus payments, and there can be no assurance that our plans will meet these quality ratings. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by funding reductions, or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments. Our participation in the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and various Medicaid and CHIP programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various  payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level, and general political issues and priorities. A reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. In 2008, CMS announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. These audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. In December 2010, CMS published for public comment a new proposed RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples. Depending on the methodology utilized, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, we are in discussions with the Office of Inspector General for HHS regarding audits of our risk adjustment data for two local plans. We are unable to predict the outcome of these audits and discussions. However, any payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. In 2009, as part of ARRA and in an effort to relieve pressure resulting from state fiscal problems and rising Medicaid enrollments, Congress increased the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), temporarily increasing federal funding for state Medicaid programs. The enhanced FMAP was set to expire at the end of 2010. Federal legislation was passed in August 2010 that extended additional enhanced FMAP funding through June 2011. The ability of states to sustain their Medicaid programs may be adversely affected if Congress does not continue the enhanced FMAP beyond June 2011, which could result in a reduction of the scope of the programs, member disenrollment, rate reductions or other adverse actions. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold, which is calculated by the government after our bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 650,000 of our auto-enrolled low-income subsidy members in 2008 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or other programs on which we bid, or our competitors submit bids that are more favorable than our bids, our results of operations could be materially affected. If we fail to comply with requirements of privacy and security regulations, including taking steps to ensure that our third-party service providers who obtain access to sensitive personal information maintain its confidentiality and security, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information by our businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the  privacy and security provisions in the federal GLBA and in HIPAA. HIPAA now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Privacy and security requirements regarding sensitive personal information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations, such as ARRA, will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes (including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards), new limitations or constraints on our business models, the development of new administrative processes, the effects of potential noncompliance by our third-party service providers, and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of sensitive personal information that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. We are awaiting final HHS regulations for many key aspects of the ARRA amendments to HIPAA. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, including mandatory disclosure to the media, significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents, increased enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages, litigation, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business, and injunctive relief. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products. We provide PBM services through our Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our PBM businesses. Our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions. Prescription Solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose Prescription Solutions to civil and criminal penalties. Further, Prescription Solutions is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands. The failure to adhere to such standards could expose Prescription Solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions.  In addition, our PBM businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. We compete with other companies on the basis of many factors, including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives, location and choice of health care providers, quality of customer service, comprehensiveness of coverage offered, reputation for quality care, financial stability and diversity of product offerings. For our Health Benefits reporting segment, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as Medicare specialty services. For our Prescription Solutions business, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS/Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses. In particular markets, competitors may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; existing business relationships; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals) in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect, if membership or demand for other services declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Adverse economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans, lower enrollment in our non-employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans. Adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, adverse economic conditions could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers. All of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a prolonged adverse economic environment could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings.  During a prolonged adverse economic environment, state and federal budgets could be adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and/or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims, and could adversely affect our results of operations. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices and services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services. Failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. For example, we are involved in litigation with out-of-network providers that is described in more detail in Litigation Matters in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The success of certain OptumHealth businesses depends on maintaining physician relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and certain health care providers are customers of our Health Services businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent third-party brokers, consultants and agents. Our products are sold in part through independent brokers, consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our independent brokers, consultants and agents, who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and/or market health care products and services of our competitors. As a result, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers, consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to them regarding our product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Because broker and agent commissions are included as health insurer administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the Health Reform Legislation, these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other health insurer administrative costs. Our relationships with brokers and agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our businesses practices to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions and changes in the treatment of consulting fees. In addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies products. For example, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market Medicare products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changes to industry practice, which could adversely impact our ability to market our products. Our relationship with AARP is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with AARP, we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance and other products to AARP members and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to AARP members and non-members. One of our agreements with AARP expands the relationship to include AARP-branded Medicare Advantage plans for AARP members and non-members. Our agreements with AARP contain commitments regarding corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers. The AARP agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances, including, depending on the agreement, a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in our financial condition, material changes in the Medicare programs, material harm to AARP caused by us, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, meet our corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and diversity commitments, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The loss of our AARP relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, medical malpractice, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters; however, it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2010. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have negatively impacted our investment income, and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform on their obligations, could reduce our net investment income as we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. We also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, illiquidity or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our shareholders equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected. Goodwill and other intangible assets were $25.7 billion as of December 31, 2010, representing 41% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. For example, the  manner in or the extent to which the Health Reform Legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses as part of our business strategy, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Large-scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. Such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the U.S. economy in general and the health care industry specifically. For example, in the event of a natural disaster, bioterrorism attack, pandemic or other extreme events, we could face, among other things, significant medical costs and increased use of health care services. Any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products, and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations.  If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states departments of insurance. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. In addition, we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, and could adversely affect our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase of shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the  future. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group), for the five-year period ended December 31, 2010. The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2010. We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2005 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.  Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy. ##TABLE_START   12/05   12/06   12/07   12/08   12/09   12/10  UnitedHealth Group  $ 100.00   $ 86.51   $ 93.76   $ 42.89   $ 49.22   $ 58.95  SP 500   100.00    115.80    122.16    76.96    97.33    111.99  Fortune 50 Group   100.00    113.40    106.04    55.84    62.44    73.77  ##TABLE_END The stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, whose focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost; support the physician/patient relationship; and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to help make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well-being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and consulting businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider  contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs and recently enacted Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2011, we expect consumer usage of the health system to increase, resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth. We will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability. However, an increase in utilization will likely result in increased medical costs and an increase in our medical care ratio. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see Liquidity below. 2011 Business Realignment On January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, in 2011 OptumHealths results of operations will include our clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi-specialty clinics in Nevada and our Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals results of operations will include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. There were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes. Our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in  the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Health Care Reforms. In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued regulations (or proposed regulations) on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates. We operate a diversified set of businesses that focus on health care, and our business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium rate increases for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, as well as in prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population-based health and wellness programs will continue to grow. Beginning in 2011, health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals) will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Rebate payments, if any, for 2011 would be made in mid 2012. The potential for and size of the rebates will be measured at the market level, by state and by licensed subsidiary. This disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in estimates of rebates owed in total. In the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained. Depending on the results of the calculation, there is a broad range of potential rebate and other business impacts and there could be meaningful disruption in local health care markets if companies decide to adjust their offerings in response to these requirements. For example, companies could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. Companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services. Companies continue to face a significant amount of uncertainty given the breadth of possible changes, including changes in the competitive environment, state rate approval, fluctuations in medical costs, the statistical variation that results from assessing business by state, by license and by market and the potential for meaningful market disruption in 2011 and 2012. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to this legislation, including reducing broker commissions, and are evaluating changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. Other market participants could also implement changes to their business practices in response to this legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. The Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS recently proposed a regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10%, and the proposed rule clarifies that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% or more. The  Federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. Ultimately, rate approval responsibility still lies with the states under the proposed regulation. Depending on the level of anticipated increased scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression. Effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs and 7% on generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This statutory reduction in drug prices for seniors in the coverage gap may cause people who may have had difficulty affording their medications to increase their pharmaceutical usage. The change in pricing could also have secondary effects, such as changing the mix of brand name and generic drug usage by seniors. We have incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in our 2011 product pricing and pharmacy benefit management business plan. As part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. We expect the 2011 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect (plans will ultimately receive 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. All of these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can adjust members benefits, decide on a county-by-county basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses. Quality bonus payments may further offset these anticipated rate reductions as CMS quality rating bonus payments are phased in over three years beginning in 2012. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the anticipated increase in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings. The Health Reform Legislation presents additional opportunities and challenges over the longer term, including the assessment of an annual $8 billion insurance industry assessment beginning in 2014, the operation of state-based exchanges for individuals and small businesses beginning in 2014, and numerous other commercial and governmental plan requirements. Individual states may also accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads when Medicaid market expansions take place in 2014. The law could increase near-term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. Due to the complexity of the health care system and the numerous changes that are taking place, the longer term effect of the new legislation remains difficult to assess. Court proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation, such as the ruling by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida (in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general and/or governors) that declared the entire legislation unconstitutional, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and the related risk factors, see Item 1, Business  Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our customers, and have put pressure on our overall growth and  operating profitability. If the current economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Government funding pressure, coupled with adverse economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to current economic conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I.

Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. For 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels; more efficient claims handling and processing, which results in higher completion factors; a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. The medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at Ingenix, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: ##TABLE_START   Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community  State; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Ingenix; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Prescription Solutions. ##TABLE_END  See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

In 2010, revenues were $41.2 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual; $35.9 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement; and $10.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. In 2009, revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. Health Benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental customers, a general moderation in year-over-year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a loss of some smaller specialty benefits customers. The operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the Mental Health Parity Act. Ingenix Increased revenues in Ingenix for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. The decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.5 billion and $12.6 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prescription Solutions operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in  risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment-related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments Health Benefits Revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower short-term investment yields. 2009 revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. 2008 revenues were $41.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual; $28.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement; and $6.0 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. Health Benefits operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations.  OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large-scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start-up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance-based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses; and continued productivity improvements in our operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in  the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends received in both 2010 and 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,  (in millions)  2010   2009   2008  Sources of cash:    Cash provided by operating activities  $ 6,273   $ 5,625   $ 4,238  Sales of investments   2,593    4,040    5,568  Maturities of investments   3,105    2,675    3,030  Proceeds from customer funds administered   974    204    0  Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, net   930    0    0  Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt   747    0    2,981  Interest rate swap termination   0    513    0  Other   299    342    1,770              Total sources of cash   14,921    13,399    17,587              Uses of cash:    Purchases of investments   (7,855 )   (6,466 )   (9,251 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition   (2,304 )   (486 )   (3,813 ) Retirement of long-term debt   (1,583 )   (1,350 )   (500 ) Common stock repurchases   (2,517 )   (1,801 )   (2,684 ) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software   (878 )   (739 )   (791 ) Dividends paid   (449 )   (36 )   (37 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net   0    (99 )   (1,346 ) Other   (12 )   (48 )   (604 )             Total uses of cash   (15,598 )   (11,025 )   (19,026 )             Net (decrease) increase in cash  $ (677 )  $ 2,374   $ (1,439 )             ##TABLE_END  2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings and the early receipt of certain 2011 premium payments in late 2010. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and uses of operating cash to purchase investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $25.7 billion included $9.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $974 million was held by non-regulated entities), $16.1 billion of debt securities and $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.7 billion of  state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2010. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $930 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Our issuance of commercial paper in 2010 was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level. Bank Credit Facility . We have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of December 31, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, was 30.1% and 32.1% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2010. Debt Issuance . In October 2010, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes under our February 2008 S-3 shelf registration statement. The issuance included $450 million of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2020 and $300 million of 5.700% fixed-rate notes due October 2040. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch (a)  A.M. Best   Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt  Baa1  Stable  A-  Stable  A-  Negative  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper  P-2  n/a  A-2  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) On January 12, 2011, Fitch updated their ratings outlook on our senior unsecured debt to stable. ##TABLE_END The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain preset parameters. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. In 2010, we repurchased 76 million shares at an average price of approximately $33 per share and an aggregate cost of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 48 million shares of our common stock.  Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Dividends. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends are at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010, our policy had been to pay an annual dividend. The following table provides details of our dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Year  Aggregate Amount per Share   Total Amount Paid       (in millions)  2008  $ 0.030   $ 37  2009   0.030    36  2010   0.405    449  ##TABLE_END CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2010, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2011   2012 to 2013   2014 to 2015   Thereafter   Total  Debt (a)  $ 3,008   $ 2,228   $ 1,780   $ 11,360   $ 18,376  Operating leases   259    431    285    579    1,554  Purchase obligations (b)   264    114    5    1    384  Future policy benefits (c)   126    356    380    1,625    2,487  Unrecognized tax benefits (d)   20    0    0    147    167  Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e)   364    100    0    2,268    2,732  Other obligations (f)   76    88    72    12    248                      Total contractual obligations  $ 4,117   $ 3,317   $ 2,522   $ 15,992   $ 25,948                      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. Coupon payments have been calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2010 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (d) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition, interest rate swaps and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2010, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs  is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2010, 2009 and 2008, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $800 million, $310 million and $230 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2010: ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable    (in millions)  (0.75)%  $ 186  (0.50)   124  (0.25)   62  0.25   (61 ) 0.50   (122 ) 0.75   (183 ) ##TABLE_END Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2010: ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable    (in millions)  3%  $ 366  2   244  1   122  (1)   (122 ) (2)   (244 ) (3)   (366 ) ##TABLE_END The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2010, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes  the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2010; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2010 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2010 net earnings would increase or decrease by $51 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.05 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. Beginning in 2011, premium revenue subject to the medical loss ratio rebates of the Health Reform Legislation will be recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, if that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium will be revised each period to reflect current experience. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether  goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2011, which considered our business realignment, and determined that other than the $172 million impairment related to certain of Ingenixs businesses, no goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2010. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business  Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. Investments As of December 31, 2010, we had investments with a carrying value of $16.8 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2010, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $527 million and gross unrealized losses of $81 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the  security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2010 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $74 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions.  LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2010, $9.1 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $7.1 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, $16.3 billion of our investments was fixed-rate debt securities and $4.0 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): ##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)   Interest Expense Per Annum (a)   Fair Value of Financial Investments   Fair Value of Debt  2%  $ 182   $ 163   $ (1,177 )  $ (860 ) 1   91    82    (602 )   (471 ) (1)   (10 )   (21 )   613    560  (2)   nm    nm    1,227    1,240  ##TABLE_END nm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2010, we had $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2011

Consolidated Financial Statements  UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (also referred to as UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to making health care work better. The Company emphasizes enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well-being of the people it serves and their communities. The Company helps people get the care they need at an affordable cost; supports the physician/patient relationship; and empowers people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. The Companys primary focus is on improving the health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery, promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care, and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to improve access to health and well-being services, simplify the health care experience, promote quality and make health care more affordable. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to medical costs, medical costs payable, revenues, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments, income taxes and contingent liabilities. These estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any changes in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. The Company recognizes premium revenues in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. The Company records health care premium payments received from its customers in advance of the service period as unearned revenues. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this  risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed based upon the fee charged to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependants, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. Since the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through the Companys Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized always exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized upon sale or shipment based on contract terms. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix publishing and software products that are recognized as revenue upon estimated delivery date. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which the Company has either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care professional contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates, and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, the Companys operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The Company had checks outstanding in excess of bank deposits of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2009, which were classified as Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the changes have been reflected as Checks Outstanding within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from earnings and reports them, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. The Company evaluates investments for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, the Company recognizes impairments in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the securitys cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company uses the specific cost or amortized cost of each investment sold. Assets Under Management The Company administers certain aspects of AARPs insurance program (see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the AARP contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with the AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Companys earnings.  Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmacy rebates, CMS for Medicare Part D, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its PBM businesses affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of Product Revenue. The Company generally receives rebates between two to five months after billing. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivables below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are six separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START   CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Policy Liabilities or Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and therefore are recorded as Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in Unearned Revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. The Company is fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to the Company. Amounts received for these subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. However, as of December 31, 2009, the amounts received for these subsidies were insufficient to cover the costs incurred for these contract elements; therefore, the Company recorded a receivable in Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in Medical Costs and Operating Costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2010 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2011, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009  (in millions)  CMS Subsidies (a)   Risk-Share   CMS Subsidies (a)   Risk-Share  Other current receivables  $ 0   $ 0   $ 271   $ 0  Other policy liabilities   475    265    0    268  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Includes the Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. ##TABLE_END As of January 1, 2011, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START   The initial coverage limit increased to $2,840 from $2,830 in 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,448 as compared to $6,440 in 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The annual out-of-pocket maximum remained at $4,550 for 2011. ##TABLE_END Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company reviews property, equipment and capitalized software for events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that it might not recover their carrying value. If the Company determines that an asset may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded.  The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment  3 to 7 years Buildings  35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements  7 years or length of lease term, whichever is shorter Capitalized software  3 to 5 years ##TABLE_END Goodwill Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the Company performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. The Company calculates the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (includes significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. The Company completed its annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2011 and determined that other than the $172 million impairment related to the Ingenix business discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, no impairment existed as of December 31, 2010. Although the Company believes that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of its reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms, as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long-term growth rate assumptions for some or all of its reporting units. Intangible assets Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, and trademarks). The Company does not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded.  The Company calculates the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. The Company considers many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP program (see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract above), and the current portion of future policy benefits. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivables Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation (Golden Rule) subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $126 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.9 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $139 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.9 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be cancelled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date fair values of the awards and is recognized as expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests.  Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted shares, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Recent Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010-06). This update amends the fair value guidance of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) to require additional disclosures regarding (i) transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and (ii) activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding (i) the level of asset and liability disaggregation and (ii) fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for the Companys fiscal year 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which will be effective for the Companys fiscal year 2011. The Companys fair value disclosures, including the new disclosures effective in 2010, have been included in Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or materially apply to its operations.  3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its investments that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses on investments in state and municipal obligations and corporate obligations as of December 31, 2010 were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. The Company evaluates impairment at each reporting period for securities where the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the state and municipal obligations and the corporate obligations, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). The unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities as of December 31, 2010 were primarily caused by higher  interest rates in the marketplace, reflecting the higher perceived risk assigned by fixed-income investors to commercial mortgage-backed securities. These unrealized losses represented less than 1% of the total amortized cost of the Companys mortgage-backed security holdings as of December 31, 2010. The Company believes these losses to be temporary. All of the Companys mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2010 were rated AAA with no known deterioration or other factors leading to an OTTI. As of December 31, 2010, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys holdings of non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities included $8 million of commercial mortgage loans in default. These investments were acquired in the first quarter of 2008 pursuant to an acquisition and were recorded at fair value. They represented less than 1% of the Companys total mortgage-backed security holdings as of December 31, 2010. A portion of the Companys investments in equity securities and venture capital funds consists of investments held in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care services and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care and related technology stocks will likewise impact the value of the Companys equity portfolio. The equity securities and venture capital funds were evaluated for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains (losses), before taxes, were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   Year Ended December 31,  (in millions)  2010   2009   2008  Total OTTI  $ (23 )  $ (64 )  $ (121 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income   0    0    n/a              Net OTTI recognized in earnings   (23 )   (64 )   (121 ) Gross realized losses from sales   (6 )   (41 )   (50 ) Gross realized gains from sales   100    116    165              Net realized gains (losses)  $ 71   $ 11   $ (6 )             ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of the recorded OTTI charges resulted from the Companys intent to sell certain impaired securities. 4. Fair Value Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, non-binding broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on the Companys internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, the Company has not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service.  In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1  Quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START    Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, non-current prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, default rates); and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.  The following table presents information about the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding AARP Program-related assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the valuation techniques the Company used to determine their fair values. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on AARP. ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)   Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Total Fair Value  December 31, 2010     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 8,069   $ 1,054   $ 0   $ 9,123  Debt securities  available-for-sale:     U.S. government and agency obligations   1,515    719    0    2,234  State and municipal obligations   0    6,148    0    6,148  Corporate obligations   31    5,146    133    5,310  U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    1,903    0    1,903  Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    457    8    465                  Total debt securities  available-for-sale   1,546    14,373    141    16,060  Equity securities  available-for-sale   306    2    208    516                  Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value   9,921    15,429    349    25,699                  Interest rate swap assets   0    46    0    46                  Total assets at fair value  $ 9,921   $ 15,475   $ 349   $ 25,745                  Percentage of total assets at fair value   39 %   60 %   1 %   100 %                 Interest rate swap liabilities  $ 0   $ 104   $ 0   $ 104                  December 31, 2009     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 9,135   $ 665   $ 0   $ 9,800  Debt securities  available-for-sale:     U.S. government and agency obligations   1,024    543    0    1,567  State and municipal obligations   0    6,317    0    6,317  Corporate obligations   18    3,293    110    3,421  U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    1,931    0    1,931  Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    528    10    538                  Total debt securities  available-for-sale   1,042    12,612    120    13,774  Equity securities  available-for-sale   262    3    312    577                  Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value  $ 10,439   $ 13,280   $ 432   $ 24,151                  Percentage of total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value   43 %   55 %   2 %   100 %                 ##TABLE_END There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the year ended December 31, 2010. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.  Debt Securities. The estimated fair values of debt securities held as available-for-sale are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Equity Securities. Equity securities are held as available-for-sale investments. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using market modeling approaches that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. These investments totaled $166 million and $282 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The key inputs utilized in the Companys market modeling include, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries and having similar revenue and growth characteristics; similar preferences in the capital structure; discounted cash flows; liquidation values and milestones established at initial funding; and the assumption that the values of the Companys venture capital investments can be inferred from these inputs. The Companys remaining Level 3 equity securities holdings of $42 million and $30 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, consist of preferred stock and other items for which there are no active markets. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys interest rate swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded, the fair values are classified as Level 2. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs is as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009   December 31, 2008  (in millions)  Debt Securities   Equity Securities   Total   Debt Securities   Equity Securities   Total   Debt Securities   Equity Securities   Total  Balance at beginning of period  $ 120   $ 312   $ 432   $ 62   $ 304   $ 366   $ 0   $ 133   $ 133  Purchases (sales), net   19    (122 )   (103 )   64    22    86    14    202    216  Net unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income   0    9    9    0    7    7    0    2    2  Net realized gains (losses) in investment and other income   2    9    11    (6 )   (21 )   (27 )   0    (54 )   (54 ) Transfers into Level 3   0    0    0    0    0    0    48    21    69                                      Balance at end of period  $ 141   $ 208   $ 349   $ 120   $ 312   $ 432   $ 62   $ 304   $ 366                                      ##TABLE_END With the exception of the goodwill impairment related to the Ingenix business, as discussed in Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there were no significant fair value adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment and are classified as Level 3.  The table below includes fair values for certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. The carrying values and fair values of these financial instruments were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009  (in millions)  Carrying Value   Fair Value   Carrying Value   Fair Value  Assets     Debt securities  available-for-sale  $ 16,060   $ 16,060   $ 13,774   $ 13,774  Equity securities  available-for-sale   516    516    577    577  Debt securities  held-to-maturity   203    208    199    203  AARP Program-related investments   2,435    2,435    2,114    2,114  Interest rate swap assets   46    46    0    0  Liabilities     Senior unsecured notes   10,212    10,903    11,173    11,043  Interest rate swap liabilities   104    104    0    0  ##TABLE_END In addition to the previously described methods and assumptions for debt and equity securities and interest rate swaps, the following are the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the other financial instruments: AARP Program-related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt and equity securities held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program (see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company elected to measure the AARP assets under management at fair value pursuant to the fair value option. See the preceding discussion regarding the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of investments in debt and equity securities. Senior Unsecured Notes. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes are estimated based on third-party quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other current receivables, unearned revenues, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table above. 5.

Amortization expense for capitalized software for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $349 million, $314 million and $290 million, respectively. 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting segment, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Health Benefits   OptumHealth   Ingenix   Prescription Solutions   Consolidated  Balance at January 1, 2009  $ 17,044   $ 1,152   $ 1,052   $ 840   $ 20,088  Acquisitions   161    40    415    0    616  Subsequent payments and adjustments, net   61    (34 )   (4 )   0    23                      Balance at December 31, 2009   17,266    1,158    1,463    840    20,727  Acquisitions   0    187    2,022    0    2,209  Impairment   0    0    (172 )   0    (172 ) Subsequent payments and adjustments, net   (14 )   0    (5 )   0    (19 )                     Balance at December 31, 2010  $ 17,252   $ 1,345   $ 3,308   $ 840   $ 22,745                      ##TABLE_END In 2010, there was a decline in the economic environment and competitive landscape for the clinical trial support businesses within one of the Ingenix reporting units. These businesses experienced unexpected declines in new business authorizations from historical levels including continued delays in and lengthening of the selling cycle. During this time the Company began evaluating strategic options with respect to the clinical trial support businesses. In December 2010, as part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company considered the aforementioned market conditions and operating results as well as indications of interest the Company began to receive on the clinical trial support businesses as the fair value of the reporting unit was evaluated. As a result of that analysis, the Company determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and an impairment charge of $172 million was recorded. The implied fair value of the reporting unit was determined by a combination of valuation techniques, including discounting future expected cash flows and expected sale proceeds. The gross carrying value, accumulated amortization and net carrying value of other intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009  (in millions)  Gross Carrying Value   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Value   Gross Carrying Value   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Value  Customer contracts and membership lists  $ 3,623   $ (1,038 )  $ 2,585   $ 2,864   $ (796 )  $ 2,068  Patents, trademarks and technology   505    (246 )   259    437    (187 )   250  Other   132    (66 )   66    118    (55 )   63                          Total  $ 4,260   $ (1,350 )  $ 2,910   $ 3,419   $ (1,038 )  $ 2,381                          ##TABLE_END The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations consisted of the following by year of acquisition: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009  (in millions, except years)  Fair Value   Weighted- Average Useful Life   Fair Value   Weighted- Average Useful Life  Customer contracts and membership lists  $ 786    14 years   $ 239    12 years  Patents, trademarks, and technology   94    8 years    41    9 years  Other   14    9 years    1    2 years                  Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets  $ 894    13 years   $ 281    12 years                  ##TABLE_END  Estimated full year amortization expense relating to intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Estimated Amortization Expense  2011  $ 316  2012   312  2013   304  2014   294  2015   280  ##TABLE_END Amortization expense relating to intangible assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $317 million, $241 million and $252 million, respectively. 7. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there was $800 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels; more efficient claims handling and processing, which results in higher completion factors; a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. None of the factors discussed above were individually material to the net favorable medical cost development for the years ended 2009 and 2008. The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010   2009   2008  Medical costs payable, beginning of period  $ 9,362   $ 8,664   $ 8,331  Acquisitions   0    252    331  Reported medical costs:    Current year   69,641    65,599    60,589  Prior years   (800 )   (310 )   (230 )             Total reported medical costs   68,841    65,289    60,359              Claim payments:    Payments for current year   (60,949 )   (57,109 )   (52,872 ) Payments for prior year   (8,034 )   (7,734 )   (7,485 )             Total claim payments   (68,983 )   (64,843 )   (60,357 )             Medical costs payable, end of period  $ 9,220   $ 9,362   $ 8,664              ##TABLE_END  8.

As of December 31, 2010, the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.4%. The Company has a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports the Companys commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of December 31, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%. Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facility contains various covenants including requiring the Company to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, below 50%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2010. Long-Term Debt In October 2010, the Company issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes under its February 2008 S-3 shelf registration statement. The issuance included $450 million of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2020 and $300 million of 5.700% fixed-rate notes due October 2040. In February 2010, the Company completed cash tender offers for $775 million in aggregate principal of certain of its outstanding fixed-rate notes to improve the matching of interest rate exposure related to its floating rate assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. In February 2008, the Company issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of floating-rate notes due February 2011, $550 million of 4.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2013, $1.1 billion of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2018 and $1.1 billion of 6.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2038. Interest Rate Swap Contracts During 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and investment balances. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on fixed-rate debt issues maturing between March 2011 through March 2016 and June 2017 through October 2020. Since the specific terms and notional amounts of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they were assumed to be highly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the swaps were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the location and fair value of fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010: ##TABLE_START Notional Amount  Balance Sheet Location  Fair Value   (in millions)    (in millions) $ 5,725  Other assets  $46  Other liabilities  104 ##TABLE_END  The following table provides a summary of the effect of changes in fair value of fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Year Ended December 31, 2010   Hedge loss recognized in interest expense  $ (58 ) Hedged item gain recognized in interest expense   58      Net impact on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations  $ 0      ##TABLE_END 9. Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010   2009   2008  Current Provision:    Federal  $ 2,524   $ 1,924   $ 1,564  State and local   180    78    145              Total current provision   2,704    2,002    1,709  Deferred provision   45    (16 )   (62 )             Total provision for income taxes  $ 2,749   $ 1,986   $ 1,647              ##TABLE_END The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. Federal Statutory Rate to the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)  2010   2009   2008  Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 2,584    35.0 %  $ 2,033    35.0 %  $ 1,618    35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   129    1.7    66    1.1    106    2.2  Settlement of state exams, net of federal benefit   (3 )   0    (40 )   (0.7 )   (12 )   (0.2 ) Tax-exempt investment income   (65 )   (0.9 )   (70 )   (1.2 )   (69 )   (1.5 ) Non-deductible compensation   64    0.9    0    0    0    0  Other, net   40    0.5    (3 )   0    4    0.1                          Provision for income taxes  $ 2,749    37.2 %  $ 1,986    34.2 %  $ 1,647    35.6 %                         ##TABLE_END The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2010 resulted primarily from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters, as well as from the limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Health Reform Legislation), which was signed into law during the first quarter of 2010.  The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010   2009  Deferred income tax assets:   Share-based compensation  $ 385   $ 419  Net operating loss carryforwards   285    206  Accrued expenses and allowances   233    201  Long term liabilities   147    164  Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   102    218  Unearned revenues   78    58  Unrecognized tax benefits   62    55  Other   215    190          Subtotal   1,507    1,511  Less: valuation allowances   (247 )   (198 )         Total deferred income tax assets  $ 1,260   $ 1,313          Deferred income tax liabilities:   Intangible assets  $ (1,104 )  $ (890 ) Capitalized software development   (450 )   (449 ) Net unrealized gains on investments   (161 )   (163 ) Depreciation and amortization   (140 )   (80 ) Prepaid expenses   (92 )   (90 )         Total deferred income tax liabilities   (1,947 )   (1,672 )         Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (687 )  $ (359 )         ##TABLE_END Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $149 million expire beginning in 2011 through 2030, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2011 through 2029. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  2010   2009  Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $ 220   $ 340  Gross increases:   Current year tax positions   13    10  Prior year tax positions   30    11  Gross decreases:   Prior year tax positions   0    (62 ) Settlements   0    (61 ) Statute of limitations lapses   (43 )   (18 )         Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $ 220   $ 220          ##TABLE_END The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized $15 million of interest expense and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a net tax benefit of $7 million generated from the reduction in interest accrued from the release of previously accrued tax matters. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $63 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions and, as of December 31, 2009, the Company had $44 million of  accrued interest. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, was $128 million. The Company currently files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2009 and prior. The Companys 2010 tax returns are under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to 2004. The Company does not believe any adjustments that may result from these examinations will be significant. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $118 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. 10. Shareholders Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was $3.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends received in both 2010 and 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. As of December 31, 2010, $974 million of the Companys $25.9 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated entities. The Companys regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $11 billion as of December 31, 2010; regulated entity statutory capital exceeded state minimum capital requirements. OptumHealth Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2010, the Company believes that OptumHealth Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Dividends In May 2010, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys cash dividend to shareholders and moved the Company to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010, the Companys policy had been to pay an annual dividend.  The following table provides details of the Companys dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Year  Aggregate Amount per Share   Total Amount Paid       (in millions)  2008  $ 0.030   $ 37  2009   0.030    36  2010   0.405    449  ##TABLE_END Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain Board restrictions. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased the Companys share repurchase program, and authorized the Company to repurchase up to 120 million shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased 76 million shares at an average price of approximately $33 per share and an aggregate cost of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 48 million shares of its common stock. 11. Share-Based Compensation The Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan), as amended and restated May 15, 2002, is intended to attract and retain employees and non-employee directors, offer them incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Companys business and afford them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The Plan allows the Company to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards or other stock-based awards to eligible employees and non-employee directors. The Plan incorporates the following prior plans: 1991 Stock and Incentive Plan, 1998 Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan. All outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other awards issued under the prior plans shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of these plans under which they were issued. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 63.4 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), and up to 12.5 million of awards in restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares). The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares.  Stock Options and SARs Stock options and SARs generally vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START   Shares   Weighted- Average Exercise Price   Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life   Aggregate Intrinsic Value    (in millions)      (in years)   (in millions)  Outstanding at beginning of period   124   $ 39    Granted   10    33    Exercised   (12 )   19    Forfeited   (10 )   39              Outstanding at end of period   112   $ 40    5.3   $ 395            Exercisable at end of period   82   $ 42    4.4   $ 283  Vested and expected to vest end of period   110   $ 40    5.3   $ 388  ##TABLE_END To determine compensation expense related to the Companys stock options and SARs, the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. For purposes of estimating the fair value of the Companys employee stock option and SAR grants, the Company uses a binomial model. The principal assumptions the Company used in applying the option-pricing models were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2010   2009   2008  Risk free interest rate   1.0% - 2.1%    1.7% - 2.4%    2.2% - 3.4%  Expected volatility   45.4% - 46.2%    41.3% - 46.8%    29.5%  Expected dividend yield   0.1% - 1.7%    0.1%    0.1%  Forfeiture rate   5.0%    5.0%    5.0%  Expected life in years   4.6 - 5.1    4.4 - 5.1    4.3  ##TABLE_END Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Beginning in 2009, the Company changed the weighting of historical and implied volatilities used in the calculation of expected volatility to 90% and 10%, respectively. Before the change, the Company had weighted historical and implied volatility equally. Due to the significant economic turbulence and resulting instability of the exchange-traded options throughout 2008, the Company concluded that they were no longer as representative of the fair value of its common stock over the expected life of its options and SARs. The change had no impact on the Companys reported Net Earnings nor Earnings per Share. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and SARs granted for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $13 per share, $10 per share and $9 per share. The total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $164 million, $282 million and $244 million, respectively.  Restricted Shares Restricted shares generally vest ratably over three to five years. Compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares   Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Nonvested at beginning of period   11   $ 32  Granted   6    32  Vested   (3 )   33  Forfeited   (1 )   32          Nonvested at end of period   13   $ 31          ##TABLE_END The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $32 per share, $29 per share and $34 per share, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $99 million, $56 million and $17 million, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is intended to enhance employee commitment to the goals of the Company, by providing a means of achieving stock ownership at advantageous terms to eligible employees of the Company. Eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, 3.8 million shares, 3.7 million shares and 2.9 million shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP. The compensation expense is included in the compensation expense amounts recognized and discussed below. As of December 31, 2010, there were 5.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Share-Based Compensation Recognition The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, SARs and restricted shares, on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Beginning with share-based awards granted in 2009, the Companys equity award program includes a retirement provision that treats all employees who are age 55 or older with at least ten years of recognized employment with the Company as retirement-eligible. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized compensation expense related to its share-based compensation plans of $326 million ($278 million net of tax effects), $334 million ($220 million net of tax effects) and $305 million ($202 million net of tax effects), respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recognized in Operating Costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2010, there was $449 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, the income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises was $78 million, $94 million and $106 million, respectively. As further discussed in Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure, cost of capital and return to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued for share-based award exercises. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for all employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not significant for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within Long-Term Investments with an approximately equal amount in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $258 million and $216 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 12. AARP The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the Program), and separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. In October 2007, the Company entered into four agreements with AARP, effective January 1, 2008, that amended its existing AARP arrangements. These agreements extended the Companys arrangements with AARP on the Program to December 31, 2017, extended the Companys arrangement with AARP on the Medicare Part D business to December 31, 2014, and gave the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Companys Medicare Advantage offerings until December 31, 2014, subject to certain limited exclusions. Under the Program, the Company is compensated for transaction processing and other services, as well as for assuming underwriting risk. The Company is also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings. Premium revenues from the Companys portion of the Program for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $6.3 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. The Companys agreement with AARP on the Program provides for the maintenance of the RSF that is held by the Company on behalf of policyholders. Underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. The RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the RSF are reported in Medical Costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company believes the RSF balance as of December 31, 2010 is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract. The effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under the Companys agreement with AARP, the Company separately manages the assets that support the Program. These assets are held at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Assets Under Management. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by the Program and are used to pay costs associated with the Program. The Company does not guarantee any rates of investment return on these investments and upon any transfer of the Program to another entity, the Company would transfer cash in an amount equal to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF and, thus, are not included in the Companys earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the AARP RSF and were $107 million, $99 million and $82 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The Company elected to measure the entirety of the AARP Assets Under Management at fair value, pursuant to the fair value option. The following AARP Program-related assets and liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  December 31, 2010   December 31, 2009  Accounts receivable  $ 526   $ 509  Assets under management   2,550    2,383  Medical costs payable   1,150    1,182  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   48    40  Other policy liabilities   1,286    1,145  Future policy benefits   533    482  Other liabilities   59    43  ##TABLE_END The fair value of cash, cash equivalents and investments associated with the Program, reflected as assets under management, and the fair value of other assets and other liabilities were classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)   Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Total Fair Value  December 31, 2010     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 115   $ 0   $ 0   $ 115  Debt securities:     U.S. government and agency obligations   515    244    0    759  State and municipal obligations   0    15    0    15  Corporate obligations   0    1,129    0    1,129  U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    393    0    393  Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    137    0    137                  Total debt securities   515    1,918    0    2,433                  Equity securities  available-for-sale   0    2    0    2                  Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value  $ 630   $ 1,920   $ 0   $ 2,550                  Other liabilities  $ 0   $ 0   $ 59   $ 59                  Total liabilities at fair value  $ 0   $ 0   $ 59   $ 59                  December 31, 2009     Cash and cash equivalents  $ 269   $ 0   $ 0   $ 269  Debt securities:     U.S. government and agency obligations   358    298    0    656  State and municipal obligations   0    9    0    9  Corporate obligations   0    955    0    955  U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    343    0    343  Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   0    149    0    149                  Total debt securities   358    1,754    0    2,112                  Equity securities  available-for-sale   0    2    0    2                  Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value  $ 627   $ 1,756   $ 0   $ 2,383                  Other liabilities  $ 0   $ 0   $ 43   $ 43                  Total liabilities at fair value  $ 0   $ 0   $ 43   $ 43                  ##TABLE_END  13. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2028. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $297 million, $303 million and $264 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all noncancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  2011  $ 259  2012   240  2013   191  2014   156  2015   129  Thereafter   579  ##TABLE_END The Company contracts on an administrative services only (ASO) basis with customers who fund their own claims. The Company charges these customers administrative fees based on the expected cost of administering their self-funded programs. In some cases, the Company provides performance guarantees related to its administrative function. If these standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. Amounts accrued for performance guarantees were not material as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $66 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $288 million, primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, providers, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys management and administration of health benefit plans. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims, and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, except as otherwise noted below, the Company is unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters MDL Litigation. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against the Company by health care providers alleging various claims relating to the Companys reimbursement practices, including alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) and state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims. Many of these lawsuits were consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District Court of Florida (MDL). In the lead MDL lawsuit, the court  certified a class of health care providers for certain of the RICO claims. In 2006, the trial court dismissed all of the claims against the Company in the lead MDL lawsuit, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed that dismissal, leaving eleven related lawsuits that had been stayed during the litigation of the lead MDL lawsuit. In August 2008, the trial court, applying its rulings in the lead MDL lawsuit, dismissed seven of these lawsuits (the seven lawsuits). The trial court also dismissed all but one claim in an eighth lawsuit, and ordered the final claim to arbitration. In December 2008, at the plaintiffs request, the trial court dismissed without prejudice one of the three remaining lawsuits. The court also denied the plaintiffs request to remand the remaining two lawsuits to state court and a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissal of those suits. In April 2009, the plaintiffs in these last two suits filed amended class action complaints alleging breach of contract, but those amended complaints were subsequently dismissed without prejudice. In July 2010, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the trial courts dismissal of the seven lawsuits and remanded those cases to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, the Company is party to a number of arbitrations in various jurisdictions involving claims similar to those alleged in the seven lawsuits. The Company is vigorously defending against the remaining claims in these cases. AMA Litigation. On March 15, 2000, a group of plaintiffs including the American Medical Association (AMA) filed a lawsuit against the Company in state court in New York, which was removed to federal court. The complaint and subsequent amended complaints asserted antitrust claims and claims based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network health care providers by the Companys affiliates. On January 14, 2009, the parties announced an agreement to settle the lawsuit, along with a similar case filed in 2008 in federal court in New Jersey. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company and its affiliated entities will be released from claims relating to their out-of-network reimbursement policies from March 15, 1994 through the date of final court approval of the settlement and the Company agreed to pay $350 million (the settlement amount) to a fund for health plan members and out-of-network providers in connection with out-of-network procedures performed since March 15, 1994. The agreement contains no admission of wrongdoing. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement over the objections of certain plaintiffs counsel on December 1, 2009, and granted final approval of the settlement on September 20, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the Company paid the settlement amount, plus interest, to an escrow account established by the plaintiffs. Several members of the plaintiff class have filed appeals challenging approval of the settlement. Other lawsuits in various jurisdictions relating to the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network health care providers remain pending against a number of health insurers, including the Company. California Claims Processing Matter. In 2007, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) examined the Companys PacifiCare health insurance plan in California. The examination findings related to the timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, provider contract implementation, provider dispute resolution and other related matters. On January 25, 2008, the CDI issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations in connection with the CDIs examination findings. On June 3, 2009, the Company filed a Notice of Defense to the Order to Show Cause denying all material allegations and asserting certain defenses. The matter has been the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge (ALJ) since December 2009. CDI amended its Order to Show Cause three times in 2010 to allege a total of 992,936 violations, the large majority of which relate to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence during a four month period in 2007. Although we believe that CDI has never issued an aggregate penalty in excess of $8 million, CDI alleges in press reports and releases that the Company could theoretically be subject to penalties of up to $10,000 per violation. The Company is vigorously defending against these claims. After the ALJ issues a ruling at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, the California Insurance Commissioner may accept, reject or modify the ALJs ruling, issue his own decision, and impose a fine or penalty. The Commissioners decision is subject to challenge in court.  Historical Stock Option Practices. In 2006, a consolidated shareholder derivative action, captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Shareholder Derivative Litigation was filed against certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The consolidated amended complaint was brought on behalf of the Company by several pension funds and other shareholders and named certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The consolidated amended complaint generally alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, were unjustly enriched and violated the securities laws in connection with the Companys historical stock option practices. On June 26, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee under Minnesota Statute 302A.241, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, with the power to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and shareholder demands and determine whether the Companys rights and remedies should be pursued. A consolidated derivative action, captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Derivative Litigation, was also filed in Hennepin County District Court, State of Minnesota. The action was brought by two individual shareholders and named certain of the Companys current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. On December 6, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee concluded its review of claims relating to the Companys historical stock option practices and published a report. The Special Litigation Committee reached settlement agreements on behalf of the Company with its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William W. McGuire, M.D., former General Counsel David J. Lubben and former director William G. Spears. In addition, the Special Litigation Committee concluded that all claims against all named defendants in the derivative actions, including current and former Company officers and directors, should be dismissed. Each settlement agreement is conditioned upon dismissal of claims in the derivative actions and resolution of any appeals. Following notice to shareholders, the federal court granted the parties motion for final approval of the proposed settlements on July 1, 2009, and entered final judgment dismissing the federal case with prejudice on July 2, 2009. The state court granted the parties motion for final approval of the proposed settlements and dismissed the state case with prejudice on May 14, 2009, and entered final judgment on July 17, 2009. The federal and state courts also awarded plaintiffs counsel fees and expenses of $30 million and $6 million, respectively, which have been paid by the Company. A shareholder filed an appeal challenging only the federal plaintiffs counsels fee award, which was dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on January 26, 2011. As previously disclosed, the Company also received inquiries from a number of federal and state regulators from 2006 through 2008 regarding its historical stock option practices. Many of those inquiries have been closed, resolved or inactive since 2008. Government Regulation The Companys business is regulated at federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing the Companys business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Further, the Company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market and sell many of its products. The Company has been and is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other governmental authorities. Examples of audits include the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits discussed below and a review by the U.S. Department of Labor of the Companys administration of applicable customer employee benefit plans with respect to ERISA compliance.  Government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits. CMS adjusts capitation payments to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary, as supported by data provided by health care providers. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers, who the Company generally relies on to appropriately code their claim submissions and document their medical records. CMS then determines the risk score and payment amount for each enrolled member based on the health care data submitted and member demographic information. As previously disclosed, in 2008, CMS announced that it would perform RADV audits of selected Medicare Advantage health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers and may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. Certain of the Companys health plans have been selected for audit. These audits are focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts. Although these audits are ongoing, the Company does not believe they will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2010, CMS published for public comment a new proposed RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples. The Company has submitted comments to CMS regarding concerns the Company has with CMSs proposed methodology. These concerns include, among others, the fact that the proposed methodology does not take into account the error rate in the original Medicare fee-for-service data that was used to develop the risk adjustment system. Additionally, payments received from CMS, as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members, are based on actuarially certified bids that did not include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. The Company believes that applying retroactive audit and payment adjustments after CMS acceptance of bids undermines the actuarial soundness of the bids. On February 3, 2011, CMS notified the Company that CMS was evaluating all comments received on the proposed methodology and that it anticipated making changes to the draft, based on input CMS had received. CMS also indicated that it anticipated the final methodology would be issued in the near future. Depending on the methodology utilized, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company is also in discussions with the OIG for Health and Human Services regarding audits of the Companys risk adjustment data for two plans. While the Company does not believe OIG has governing authority to directly impose payment adjustments for risk adjustment audits of Medicare health plans operated under the regulatory authority of CMS, the OIG can recommend to CMS a proposed payment adjustment, and the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these discussions and audits. Guaranty Fund Assessments . The Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and has petitioned a state court for liquidation. If Penn Treaty is liquidated, the Companys insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treatys policyholder claims through guaranty association assessments in future periods. The Company is unable to estimate losses or ranges of losses because the Company cannot predict when the state court will render a decision, the amount of the insolvency, if any, the amount and timing of any associated guaranty fund assessments or the availability and amount of any potential offsets, such as an offset of any premium taxes otherwise payable by the Company. An assessment could have a material adverse effect on the on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Item 1, Business  Government Regulation, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional regulatory information and related risks.  14. Segment Financial Information Factors used in determining the Companys reporting segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision-maker to evaluate its results of operations. The Companys accounting policies for reporting segment operations are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reporting segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reporting segment has at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital or working capital for non-regulated businesses. Substantially all of the Companys assets are held and operations are conducted in the United States. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, reporting segments with similar economic characteristics may be combined. The financial results of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State have been aggregated in the Health Benefits segment column in the following tables because these businesses have similar economic characteristics and have similar products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and operate in a similar regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including the Companys contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 27% for both years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and 25% for the year ended December 31, 2008 most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the Health Benefits segment. On January 1, 2011, the Company realigned certain of its businesses to respond to changes in the markets the Company serves and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, in 2011 OptumHealths results of operations will include the Companys clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi-specialty clinics in Nevada and the Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals results of operations will include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. There were no changes to the Companys reportable segments as a result of these changes. The Companys periodic filings beginning with the first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment.  The following table presents reporting segment financial information as of and for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Health Benefits   OptumHealth   Ingenix   Prescription Solutions   Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations   Consolidated  2010       Revenues  external customers:       Premiums  $ 82,890   $ 2,515   $ 0   $ 0   $ 0   $ 85,405  Services   4,015    337    1,403    64    0    5,819  Products   0    0    93    2,229    0    2,322                          Total revenues  external customers   86,905    2,852    1,496    2,293    0    93,546                          Total revenues  intersegment   0    2,930    845    14,478    (18,253 )   0  Investment and other income   537    67    0    5    0    609                          Total revenues  $ 87,442   $ 5,849   $ 2,341   $ 16,776   $ (18,253 )  $ 94,155                          Earnings from operations  $ 6,636   $ 610   $ 84   $ 534   $ 0   $ 7,864  Interest expense   0    0    0    0    (481 )   (481 )                         Earnings before income taxes  $ 6,636   $ 610   $ 84   $ 534   $ (481 )  $ 7,383                          Total assets  $ 50,178   $ 4,763   $ 5,131   $ 3,138   $ (147 )  $ 63,063  Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software  $ 495   $ 131   $ 155   $ 80   $ 17   $ 878  Depreciation and amortization  $ 709   $ 115   $ 158   $ 82   $ 0   $ 1,064  Goodwill impairment  $ 0   $ 0   $ 172   $ 0   $ 0   $ 172  2009       Revenues  external customers:       Premiums  $ 76,882   $ 2,433   $ 0   $ 0   $ 0   $ 79,315  Services   3,937    277    1,042    50    0    5,306  Products   0    0    90    1,835    0    1,925                          Total revenues  external customers   80,819    2,710    1,132    1,885    0    86,546                          Total revenues  intersegment   0    2,753    691    12,562    (16,006 )   0  Investment and other income   522    65    0    5    0    592                          Total revenues  $ 81,341   $ 5,528   $ 1,823   $ 14,452   $ (16,006 )  $ 87,138                          Earnings from operations  $ 4,788   $ 636   $ 246   $ 689   $ 0   $ 6,359  Interest expense   0    0    0    0    (551 )   (551 )                         Earnings before income taxes  $ 4,788   $ 636   $ 246   $ 689   $ (551 )  $ 5,808                          Total assets  $ 49,068   $ 4,395   $ 2,415   $ 3,061   $ 106   $ 59,045  Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software  $ 452   $ 78   $ 142   $ 67   $ 0   $ 739  Depreciation and amortization  $ 668   $ 116   $ 129   $ 78   $ 0   $ 991  2008       Revenues  external customers:       Premiums  $ 71,298   $ 2,310   $ 0   $ 0   $ 0   $ 73,608  Services   3,871    311    925    45    0    5,152  Products   0    0    95    1,560    0    1,655                          Total Revenues  external customers   75,169    2,621    1,020    1,605    0    80,415                          Total Revenues  intersegment   0    2,529    532    10,960    (14,021 )   0  Investment and other income   688    75    0    8    0    771                          Total revenues  $ 75,857   $ 5,225   $ 1,552   $ 12,573   $ (14,021 )  $ 81,186                          Earnings from operations  $ 5,068   $ 718   $ 229   $ 363   $ (1,115 )  $ 5,263  Interest expense   0    0    0    0    (639 )   (639 )                         Earnings before income taxes  $ 5,068   $ 718   $ 229   $ 363   $ (1,754 )  $ 4,624                          Total Assets  $ 46,459   $ 4,195   $ 1,755   $ 2,603   $ 803   $ 55,815  Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software  $ 522   $ 100   $ 112   $ 57   $ 0   $ 791  Depreciation and amortization  $ 691   $ 120   $ 105   $ 65   $ 0   $ 981  ##TABLE_END  15.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2010. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2010 The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. ##TABLE_START /s/ STEPHEN J.

Rangen Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer ##TABLE_END February 10, 2011  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2010. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our reports dated February 10, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, MN February 10, 2011 ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and help make health care work better (the terms we, our, us, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and our subsidiaries). Our business model has evolved and is informed by over three decades of serving the needs of the markets, and people, of health care. Today, we are helping individuals access quality care at an affordable cost; simplifying health care administration and delivery; strengthening the physician/patient relationship; promoting evidence-based care; and empowering physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in the health system with actionable data to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare serves the health benefits needs of individuals across life's stages through three businesses. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves individual consumers and employers. The unique health needs of seniors are served by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community  State serves the public health marketplace, offering states innovative Medicaid solutions. Optum serves health system participants including consumers, physicians, hospitals, governments, insurers, distributors and pharmaceutical companies, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that drive improved access, affordability, quality and simplicity across eight markets: integrated care delivery, care management, consumer engagement and support, distribution of benefits and services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2011, we managed approximately $135 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the constituents and consumers we served. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcare is advancing strategies to improve the way health care is delivered and financed, offering consumers a simpler, more affordable health care experience. Our market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  a national scale; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of our product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END 1 ##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a commitment to innovation. ##TABLE_END The financial results of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community  State have been aggregated in the UnitedHealthcare reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods, operational processes and regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as OptumRx prescription drug services, OptumHealth care solutions and behavioral health services and OptumInsight fraud and abuse prevention and detection. UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include a total of nearly 754,000 physicians and other health care professionals and nearly 5,400 hospitals across the United States (UnitedHealthcare Network). UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual works closely with employers and individuals to provide health benefit plans that provide personalized solutions to help members live healthier lives and achieve meaningful cost savings. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide, providing nearly 26 million Americans access to health care as of December 31, 2011. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependants, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees' dependants, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides customized services such as coordination and facilitation of medical services and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. Large employer groups, such as those serviced by UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts, typically use self-funded arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts served approximately 400 large employer groups under these arrangements, including 147 of the Fortune 500 companies. Smaller employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or able to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. As the commercial market becomes more consumer-oriented, individuals are assuming more personal and financial responsibility for their care, and they are demanding more affordable products, greater transparency and choice and personalized help navigating the complex system. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals.

For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes States, CMS, Department of Defense, Veterans Administration and other federal procurement). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market segment for our health management, financial services and collaborative care services. OptumHealth is organized into five major operating groups: Care Solutions, Behavioral Solutions, Financial Services, Collaborative Care, and Logistics Health, Inc. Care Solutions . Care Solutions serves more than 41 million individuals through personalized health management (e.g., wellness, chronic and complex conditions), decision support (e.g., insurance choices, treatment and health care provider options) and access to networks of care provider specialists linked to medical conditions with high variation of quality and cost (e.g., physical health, cancer and transplants). This comprehensive solution set empowers consumers and enables their collaboration with specialty care providers that is critical to decisions that drive hospitalization and surgery. Behavioral Solutions. Behavioral Solutions serves more than 52 million individuals through global well-being solutions (e.g., employee assistance programs) and behavioral health management solutions (e.g., mental health, substance abuse) that address the emotional health needs of consumers, spanning the stress and anxiety of daily living, to depression associated with chronic illness, to clinically diagnosed mental illness. Programs combine predictive modeling, evidence-based clinical outcomes management, consumer support and peer support, with access to a leading network of behavioral health care providers. Behavioral Solutions customers have access to a national network of more than 112,000 clinicians and counselors and 3,300 facilities in approximately 6,600 locations nationwide. Financial Services.

Collaborative Care. Working closely with various health care providers in local markets and communities, Collaborative Care believes that the market is moving to a collaborative network model aligned around total population health management and outcomes-based reimbursement. In close coordination with local integrated care delivery systems, it deploys a core set of technology, risk management, analytical and clinical capabilities and tools to assist physicians in delivering high-quality care across the populations they serve. OptumHealth's coordinated post-acute care services augment primary care physicians to deliver services outside of hospitals to vulnerable, chronically ill populations.

OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. In 2011, OptumInsight standardized backlog reporting across recent acquisitions and as a result increased the backlog by $0.4 billion. OptumInsight's aggregate backlog at December 31, 2011 was $4.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $0.9 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services, the potential for cancellation, non-renewal, or early termination of service arrangements. OptumRx OptumRx provides a multitude of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. It serves more than 14 million people nationwide through its network of approximately 66,000 retail pharmacies and two mail service facilities, processing nearly 370 million adjusted retail, mail and specialty drug prescriptions annually.

OptumRx's distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Health Reform Legislation, were signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation, portions of which are summarized below, alters the regulatory environment in which we operate, in some cases to a significant degree. Federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, as well as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. In the event we fail to comply with, or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Health Care Reforms The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect, and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the U.S. Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending. Certain aspects of the Health Reform Legislation are also being challenged in federal court, with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the Health Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on certain aspects of these cases in March 2012, including the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Reform Legislation, or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether. The following outlines certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation that have recently taken effect or are expected to take effect in the coming years, assuming the legislation is implemented in its current form. Effective 2010 : The Health Reform Legislation mandated: the expansion of dependent coverage to include adult children until age 26; eliminated certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of certain essential health benefits; eliminated pre-existing condition limits for enrollees under age 19; prohibited certain policy rescissions; prohibited plans and issuers from charging higher cost sharing (copayments or coinsurance) for emergency services that are obtained out of a plan's network; and included a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members (for non-grandfathered plans). The Health Reform Legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes, including: expanding the definition of adverse benefit determination to include rescissions; extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and self-funded plans; and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices. Effective 2011 : Commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations, subject to state specific exceptions) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Rebate payments for 2011 will be made in mid 2012. A state can request a waiver of the individual market medical loss ratio for up to three years if the state petitions and provides to HHS certain supporting data, and HHS determines that the requirement is disruptive to the market in that state. By the end of 2011, 17 states petitioned HHS for waivers of the mandated individual market medical loss ratio, of which six were wholly or partially granted. The Health Reform Legislation also mandated consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs and 7% on generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These consumer discounts will gradually increase over the next several years, which will decrease consumer out-of-pocket drug spending within the coverage gap, shifting a portion of these costs to the plan sponsor.  In addition, as required under the Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a federal premium rate review process, which became effective in September 2011 and generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10% (with state-specific thresholds to be applicable commencing September 2012). The regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process. The regulations clarify that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes, but plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that become active under the Health Reform Legislation in 2014. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets. Effective 2011/2012 : CMS reduced or froze benchmarks which affect our Medicare Advantage reimbursements from CMS between 2009 and 2011, and beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks will take effect (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. In addition to other measures, quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated benchmark reductions as CMS quality rating bonuses are phased in over three years beginning in 2012. Effective 2013 : Effective beginning in 2013 with respect to services performed after 2009, the Health Reform Legislation limits the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for insurance providers if at least 25% of the insurance provider's gross premium income from health business is derived from health insurance plans that meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements. Effective 2013/2014 : The Health Reform Legislation provides for an increase in Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care program reimbursements for primary care services provided by primary care doctors (family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine) to 100% of the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014, and provides 100% federal financing for the difference in rates based on rates applicable on July 1, 2009. Effective 2014 : A number of the provisions of the Health Reform Legislation are scheduled to take effect in 2014, including: an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes; expansion of Medicaid eligibility for all individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (states can early adopt the expansion without increased federal funding prior to 2014) with states receiving full federal matching in 2014 through 2016; all individual and group health plans must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis during annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods and cannot apply pre-existing condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments; elimination of annual limits on essential benefits coverage on certain plans; establishment of state-based exchanges for individuals and small employers (generally, with up to 100 employees) as well as certain CHIP eligibles; introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values to increase comparability of competing products on the exchanges; and establishment of minimum medical loss ratio of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans, as calculated under rules that have not yet been issued. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes. The Health Reform Legislation may also create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth, but due to its complexity, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the Health Reform Legislation and related matters. Other Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS (or state agencies) for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to Medicare beneficiaries. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and risk factors in this Form 10-K for a discussion of audits by CMS. Our UnitedHealthcare reporting segment, through UnitedHealthcare Community  State, also has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations surrounding Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the Health Reform Legislation. In addition, certain of Optum's businesses hold contracts with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense, and we are subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of these contracts. Certain of UnitedHealthcare's and Optum's businesses, such as UnitedHealthcare's eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optum's high clinical acuity workflow software, hearing aid products, and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the United States that regulate clinical trials. Laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust also affect us. HIPAA, GLBA and Other Privacy and Security Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. HIPAA requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals. It also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. Federal regulations related to HIPAA include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us. Federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation, regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation. For example, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which significantly amends, and adds new privacy and security provisions to HIPAA and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information. ARRA includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. We are awaiting final regulations on many key aspects of the ARRA amendments to HIPAA. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with HIPAA, GLBA and other privacy-related regulations. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the DOL as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. Additionally, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third-party claims administration services for health care plans. FDIC. The FDIC has federal regulatory authority over OptumHealth Bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the FDIC performs periodic examinations of the bank's compliance with applicable federal banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, governmental oversight and monetary penalties. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. With the amendment of the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to adopt elements substantially similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we expect that these states will continue to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum medical loss ratios with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the Health Reform Legislation. We expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2012, and this will affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. In addition, some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, managed care organization (MCO), utilization review (UR) or third-party administrator-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, the protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker, and sales distributions laws and regulations. Our UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states), including those issuing health, long-term care, life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of a matter involving Penn Treaty Network American Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), which have been placed in rehabilitation. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRx's mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that state's board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. Privacy and Security Laws. States have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the GLBA. Like HIPAA, GLBA allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. A number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security-related regulations. UDFI. The Utah State Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) has state regulatory and supervisory authority over OptumHealth Bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements. In addition to such annual examinations, the UDFI in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the bank's compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, governmental oversight and monetary penalties.  Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Additionally, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. These laws, regulations and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Audits and Investigations We have been and are currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the FTC, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the DOL, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation, audit results or sanctions could adversely affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and retain our current business. International Regulation Most of our business is conducted in the United States. However, some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and are consequently subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, management control, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, among other matters. These international operations are also subject to United States laws that regulate activities of U.S.-based businesses abroad. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and OptumInsight reportable segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.  EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 99,000 individuals. We believe our employee relations are generally positive.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, plan, project, should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. If we fail to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under our risk-based benefit product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of these products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for certain health plans, and authorized HHS to maintain an annual review process of unreasonable increases in premiums for commercial health plans. In addition, a number of states have enhanced (or are proposing to enhance) their premium review and approval processes. See the risk factor below relating to health care reform for further discussion of these provisions. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period; however, medical cost inflation, regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products our annual net earnings for 2011 would have been reduced by approximately $215 million, excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated; new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations, and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, utilization review and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws and regulations governing government contractors. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for further information. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, in the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law, legislating broad-based changes to the U.S. health care system. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for a discussion of the Health Reform Legislation. The broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering regulations governing our business, as well as future laws and rules, and interpretation and enforcement of those laws and rules by governmental enforcement authorities, could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and/or managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states, and a number of states have enhanced (or are proposing to enhance) their rate review processes. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states), including those issuing health (which includes long-term care), life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof, or insolvency by another insurer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of a matter involving an unaffiliated entity, Penn Treaty, which has been placed in rehabilitation. Certain Optum businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties in addition to the risks of our businesses of providing managed care and health insurance products. For example, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and fee-splitting rules can impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. OptumHealth is subject to state telemedicine laws and regulations that apply to its telemedicine initiatives. Additionally, OptumHealth participates in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. We are also involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of certain of these matters. See also the risk factor below relating to our activities as a payer in various government health care programs for a discussion of audits by CMS. Reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of routine governmental investigations, the political debate surrounding the Health Reform Legislation and the political environment in general. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets, foster an increasingly active regulatory environment or result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices. This may further increase our costs of doing business and the regulatory burdens under which we operate. Some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political, economic, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction. The regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, investment, management control, fraud and anti-corruption present additional challenges for us beyond those faced by U.S.-based businesses. Such requirements and uncertainties may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. For a discussion of various laws and regulations that impact our businesses, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. The enactment or implementation of health care reforms could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs and CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation includes guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, establishes minimum medical loss ratios, creates a federal premium review process, imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits, or EOBs) between health insurers and their members, grants to members new and additional appeal rights, imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, reduces the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect, and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending. Due to the complexity of the Health Reform Legislation, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. For example, effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations). Companies with medical loss ratios below these targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. The potential for and size of the rebates will be measured by state, by group size and by licensed subsidiary. This disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed in total. Effective in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans will be required to maintain a minimum medical loss ratio of 85%. Depending on the results of these calculations and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements, there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets, and our market share, revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Health Reform Legislation requires the establishment of state-based health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014. The types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state, the availability of federal premium subsidies within exchanges, the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges, the operation of reinsurance, risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges, could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Health Reform Legislation includes a maintenance of effort (MOE) provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state. The MOE provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133% of the federal poverty level from Medicaid before implementation of expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. However, states with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. If states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Several of the provisions in the Health Reform Legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends. Examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices, annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers, enhanced coverage requirements (including discounted prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants) and the prohibition of pre-existing condition exclusions. The annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes, will increase our operating costs. Premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs. These premium increases are oftentimes subject to state regulatory approval. In this regard, the Federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. We have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California, New York and Rhode Island. In addition, as required under the Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a federal premium rate review process, which became effective in September 2011 and generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10% (with state-specific thresholds to be applicable commencing September 2012). The regulations further require commercial health plans in the individual and small group markets to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process. If we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure, our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that become active under the Health Reform Legislation in 2014. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 34 million new individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the Health Reform Legislation is implemented broadly in its current form. In addition, we expect that implementation of the Health Reform Legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses. We have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based, in part, on these assumptions, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the Health Reform Legislation than estimated or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our UnitedHealthcare offerings, or if the demand for our Optum businesses does not increase. Certain aspects of the Health Reform Legislation are also being challenged in federal court, with the proponents of such challenges seeking to limit the scope of or have all or portions of the Health Reform Legislation declared unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on certain aspects of these cases in March 2012, including the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Congress may withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Reform Legislation, or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether. Any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties, or uncertainty regarding such events, could materially and adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Health Reform Legislation or may cause us to incur additional costs of compliance. For example, if the individual mandate is declared unconstitutional or repealed without corresponding changes to other provisions of the Health Reform Legislation to protect against the risk of adverse selection (such as revisions to the guaranteed issue and renewal requirements, prohibition on pre-existing condition exclusions, and rating restrictions), our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Congress is also considering additional health care reform measures, and a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the Health Reform Legislation. The effects of the Health Reform Legislation and recently adopted state laws, and the regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder, are difficult to predict, and we cannot predict whether any other federal or state proposals will ultimately become law. Such laws and rules could force us to materially change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, adversely change the nature of our contracted network relationships, increase our medical and administrative costs and capital requirements, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our market share, our results of operations, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments and audits that could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. We also provide services to payers through our Optum businesses. These programs generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. For example, CMS reduced or froze Medicare Advantage benchmarks that drive reimbursements between 2009 and 2011, and beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks will take effect, with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these benchmark reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. As part of the Health Reform Legislation, CMS has developed a system whereby a plan that meets certain quality ratings will be entitled to various quality bonus payments. There can be no assurance that any of our plans will meet these quality ratings. Our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by funding reductions, or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments. Similarly, any reduction in Medicare Advantage payments could result in downward pressure on payments made to our Collaborative Care business in exchange for services provided to Medicare Advantage plans. Our participation in the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and various Medicaid and CHIP programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level, and general political issues and priorities. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. State Medicaid programs are also imposing other reforms, such as medical loss ratio requirements on Medicaid managed care organizations, which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the ratio standards. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as, for Medicare Part D plans only, based on comparing costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. In 2008, CMS announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. These audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans. In December 2010, CMS published for public comment a new proposed RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples. In February 2011, CMS announced that it would be making changes to the proposed methodology based, in part, on comments submitted by industry participants. As of the date of this filing, CMS has not published the revised methodology. Depending on the methodology utilized, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has audited our risk adjustment data for two local plans and has initially communicated its findings, although we cannot predict the final outcome of the audit process. Any payment adjustments required as a result of the audits or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. CMS conducts a variety of routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews across the industry. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2011, CMS conducted an audit of our Medicare Advantage and Part D business. We are in the process of responding to preliminary findings. As with any CMS review, in the event we fail to comply with applicable CMS and state laws, regulations and rules, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 470,000 of our auto-enrolled low-income subsidy members effective January 1, 2012, because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or other programs on which we bid, or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Further, many of our businesses are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for additional information. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. Compliance with new laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain our ability to manage our business model. For example, our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information may be further restricted, and we are awaiting final HHS regulations for many key aspects of the ARRA amendments to HIPAA, such as with regard to marketing, electronic health records and access reports (which may necessitate system changes). In addition, HHS has announced a pilot audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities through 2012. Although we are not aware of HHS plans to audit any of our covered entities, an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including the following consequences: mandatory disclosure of a privacy or security breach to the media; significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents; enforcement actions; material fines and penalties; an impact on our ability to process credit card transactions as well as an increase in related expenses; litigation; compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products . We provide PBM services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our PBM businesses. OptumRx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose OptumRx to civil and criminal penalties. Our PBM businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to timely process and dispense prescriptions and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is transitioning pharmacy benefit management for approximately 12 million of its commercial members, including pharmacy claims adjudication and customer service, from Medco Health Solutions, Inc. to OptumRx beginning in 2013. If we are unable to execute the transition effectively, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual could face loss of business, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. We compete with other companies on the basis of many factors, including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives, location and choice of health care providers, quality of customer service, comprehensiveness of coverage offered, reputation for quality care, financial stability and diversity of product offerings. For our UnitedHealthcare reporting segment, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the BlueCross BlueShield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as Medicare and Medicaid specialty services. For our OptumRx business, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS/Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and OptumInsight reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. In particular markets, competitors may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; existing business relationships; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals) in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or increase profitability. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect, if membership or demand for other services declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. Failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. For example, we are involved in litigation with out-of-network providers, as described in more detail in Litigation Matters in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals, and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. These changes may affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected. The success of certain Optum businesses depends on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. If our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our producers and consultants, who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and/or market health care products and services of our competitors. As a result, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to them regarding our product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Because producer commissions are included as administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the Health Reform Legislation, these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. In addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling these companies' products. For example, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of producers who market Medicare products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Our relationship with AARP is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with AARP, we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance and other products and services to AARP members under a Supplement Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program). We also provide AARP-branded Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to both AARP members and non-members. Our agreements with AARP extend to December 31, 2017 for the AARP Program and December 31, 2014 for the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D offerings. Our agreements with AARP contain commitments regarding corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers. The AARP agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances, including, depending on the agreement, a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in our financial condition, material changes in the Medicare programs, material harm to AARP caused by us, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, meet our corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and diversity commitments, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The loss of our AARP relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other things, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort (including claims related to the delivery of health care services), contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters; however, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses . Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans, lower enrollment in our non-employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers. All of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and/or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims, and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum's financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2011. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal and/or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our net investment income and we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders' equity. We also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can materially and adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our shareholders' equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders' equity and debt ratings could be materially and adversely affected. Goodwill and other intangible assets were $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2011, representing 39% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. For example, the manner in or the extent to which the Health Reform Legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business. Similarly, the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders' equity could, in turn, adversely impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Large-scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death. Such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the U.S. economy in general and the health care industry specifically. For example, in the event of a natural disaster, bioterrorism attack, pandemic or other extreme events, we could face, among other things, significant medical costs and increased use of health care services. Any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting our systems against cybersecurity risks and threats, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products, and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, an uncertain and rapidly evolving federal, state, international and industry legislative and regulatory framework related to the health information technology market may make it difficult to achieve and maintain compliance and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states' departments of insurance. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group), for the five-year period ended December 31, 2011 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2011 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2006 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.  Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and help make health care work better. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare serves the health benefits needs of individuals across life's stages through three businesses. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves individual consumers and employers. The unique health needs of seniors are served by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community  State serves the public health marketplace, offering states innovative Medicaid solutions. Optum serves health system participants including consumers, physicians, hospitals, governments, insurers, distributors and pharmaceutical companies, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. Effective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, subject to state-specific exceptions) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. As a result, our quarterly premium revenue may be reduced by a pro rata estimate of our full-year premium rebate payable under the Health Reform Legislation. Any required rebate payments for the current year are made in the third quarter of the subsequent year. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see Liquidity below. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. In 2012, we expect increasing unit costs to continue to be the primary cost driver of medical cost trends and we project steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year. We also expect an increase in prescription drug costs. We will continue to work to manage medical cost trends through care management programs, affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical management programs and initiatives focused on improving quality and affordability. Additionally, employers are continuing to select products with benefit designs that shift more of the costs to the employee. This cost shifting continues to mitigate increases in medical cost trends. Our businesses focus on affordability, consumer empowerment, wellness and prevention, payment innovations, and enhanced distribution to better serve our customer and consumer needs and demands. These business objectives are consistent with the goals of health care reform. We expect that the portion of our costs that is tied to incentive contracts that reward providers for outcome-based results and improved cost efficiencies will continue to increase. Care providers are facing market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. This is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems. The impact of such changes on our results of operations is uncertain but, we expect them to moderate the rate at which medical costs increase. This trend also provides growth opportunities for our OptumHealth and OptumInsight businesses. We attempt to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics and premium rebates at the local market level. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2012, we continue to expect reimbursements to be under pressure through government payment rates and continued market competition in commercial products. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL, the IRS and the Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates, remain pending. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth and restrict premium rate increases in certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, with a focus on prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population-based health and wellness programs will continue to grow. Following is a listing of some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items along with management's view of the related trends and uncertainties that may cause reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating performance or of future financial condition. Premium Rebates Effective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. The potential for and size of the rebates are measured by state, by group size and by licensed subsidiary. In the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained. The disaggregation of insurance pools into smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed. Other market participants could implement changes to their business practices in response to the Health Reform Legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. Insurers could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. They could also seek to adjust their operating costs by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to the Health Reform Legislation, including reducing producer commissions, and are implementing changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. Commercial Rate Increase Review The Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% (with state-specific thresholds to be applicable commencing September 2012), and clarified that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% (or applicable state threshold) or more. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets. The Federal government is also encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by affected commercial health plans (including large group plans) and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. Since August 2010, HHS has allocated approximately $250 million for grants to states to enable the states to conduct more robust reviews of requests for premium increases. Many states have applied for and received grants, and state regulators have signaled their intent to more closely scrutinize premium rates. Premium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states in 2011. As a result, we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California, New York and Rhode Island. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression. Medicare Advantage Rates As part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage risk adjusted benchmarks, which ultimately drive our CMS payments, were reduced by 1.6% in 2011 from 2010 levels. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks have taken effect (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. These changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels. We expect the 2012 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members' benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the increases in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings. It is also anticipated that CMS will release the final Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit methodology in 2012. RADV audits are intended to validate that the risk-adjusted payments Medicare Advantage plans receive are supported by medical record data. Depending upon the final RADV methodology released by CMS, recoveries from RADV audits may result in additional rate pressure.  Budget Control Act's Medicare Sequestration Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, following the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to cut the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion, triggers automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including Medicare spending cuts averaging 2% of total program costs for nine years, starting in 2013. Medicare payments exempted from sequestration include: ##TABLE_START  Part D low-income subsidies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Part D catastrophic subsidies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Payments to states for coverage of Medicare cost-sharing for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries. ##TABLE_END 32 The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for determining, calculating and implementing cuts. We are exploring strategies to mitigate any impact that may result from the cuts beginning in 2013. Insurance Industry Fee The Health Reform Legislation includes an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter). The annual fee will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity's net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions and uncertainties. Our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 due to the non-deductibility of these fees. Premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact of these and other provisions. Premium increases are generally subject to state regulatory approval and potentially to federal review. Other market participants could increase premiums at different levels which could impact our market share positively or negatively. State-based Exchanges and Coverage Expansion Effective in 2014, exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers as well as certain CHIP eligibles. The exchanges will be state-based. If a state fails to establish an exchange by the required deadline, exchanges may be administered through a federal/state partnership or by the federal government. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits and restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded. The Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. The Health Reform Legislation includes an MOE provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state. The MOE provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133% of the federal poverty level from Medicaid before implementation of expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. However, states with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. Additionally, individual states may accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services in 2012 and 2013 for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads in advance of Medicaid market expansion taking place in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 34 million additional individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the Health Reform Legislation is implemented broadly in its current form. This represents an opportunity for us to increase membership. However, serving these individuals may generate different profit margins than our existing business due to various factors, including the health status of the newly insured individuals. We expect existing participants in Medicare and Medicaid and new enrollees in state-based exchanges to transition between products and programs, offering us opportunities to design products and services that enable us to compete for new business across business segments on an ongoing basis. An acceleration of Medicaid managed care services could increase near-term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community  State. However, if states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment. Court Proceedings Court proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation continue to evolve. These court proceedings, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law.

These matters should not be considered by themselves; see below for further discussion and analysis. ##TABLE_START  Consolidated total revenues of $102 billion increased 8% over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare revenues of $95 billion rose 7% over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Optum revenues of $29 billion increased 21% over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare enrollment during 2011 grew by 1.6 million people in 2011. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consolidated medical care ratio of 80.8% increased 20 basis points over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Net earnings of $5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.73 are up 11% and 15% , respectively over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Return on Equity of 18.9% increased 20 basis points over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating cash flows of $7 billion rose 11% over 2010. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Liquidity: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Extended our credit agreement to December 2016 and increased capacity to $3 billion . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2011 debt offerings raised new debt totaling $2.25 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Debt to debt-plus-equity ratio decreased 100 basis points from 2010 to 29.1% . ##TABLE_END 2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our UnitedHealthcare businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all Optum businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use, and a modest increase in health system utilization, mainly in outpatient and physician office settings. Unit cost increases represented the majority of the increases in our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 and 2010 there was $720 million and $800 million , respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. Operating Costs The increase in our operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation. Reportable Segments Our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, are comprised of four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of our reportable segments derives its revenues. Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and clinical services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our business realignment.

UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio, which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011, and lower favorable reserve development levels. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, we estimate that we entered January 2012 down approximately 625,000 people, primarily as a result of the loss of approximately 470,000 of our auto-assigned low-income subsidy Medicare Part D beneficiaries in a number of regions being automatically reassigned to other plans as part of the annual bid process managed by CMS. We believe that we will grow from this level throughout the course of the year in the open retail market. In February 2012, we added 117,000 Medicare Advantage members from the acquisition of XLHealth Corporation. Optum. Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx. Optums operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optums businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Increased revenues at OptumHealth for the year ended December 31, 2011 were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. Earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services. OptumInsight Increased revenues at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2011 were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. OptumRx The increase in OptumRx revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion and $14.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications. We will consolidate and manage the majority of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs internally when our contract with Medco Health Solutions, Inc. expires at the end of 2012. The investments in our infrastructure and to expand our capacity will likely cause a decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin as in 2012, OptumRx expects to absorb approximately $115 million of the $150 million consolidated in-sourcing related operating costs. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add 12 million members on a staged basis in 2013. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks associated with the transition of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs to OptumRx. 2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues for 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. For 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at OptumInsight, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation due to the Health Reform Legislation. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare The revenue growth in UnitedHealthcare for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental customers, a general moderation in year-over-year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets. The operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the federal Mental Health Parity  Addiction Equity Act of 2008. OptumInsight Increased revenues in OptumInsight for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. The decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. OptumRx The increased OptumRx revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.4 billion and $12.5 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. OptumRx operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses; and continued productivity improvements that lower our operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors' approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital through risk tolerances around liquidity, credit quality, issuer limits, asset class diversification, income and duration. The policy emphasizes investment grade bonds with durations that are short to intermediate term in nature. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations and tax implications. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2011, based on the 2010 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.4 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2011 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended December 31, (in millions)    Sources of cash:       Cash provided by operating activities  $ 6,968  $ 6,273  $ 5,625 Issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments     Interest rate swap termination     Proceeds from customer funds administered    Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases      Other    Total sources of cash  8,123  7,633  6,895 Uses of cash:       Common stock repurchases  (2,994 )  (2,517 )  (1,801 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities  (1,695 )  (2,157 )   Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions  (1,459 )  (2,304 )  (486 ) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net of dispositions  (1,018 )  (878 )  (739 ) Dividends paid  (651 )  (449 )  (36 ) Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper      (1,449 ) Other    (5 )  (10 ) Total uses of cash  (7,817 )  (8,310 )  (4,521 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash  $  $ (677 )  $ 2,374 ##TABLE_END2011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $695 million , or 11% , from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. We anticipate lower year over year cash flows from operations in 2012, which will include payments in the third quarter for 2011 premium rebate obligations. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion , or 22% , primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. We anticipate an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million , or 55% , primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. 2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections, which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and the use of operating cash to purchase investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2011 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.0 billion included $9.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.6 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $18.0 billion of debt securities and $544 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. We had $417 million of Level 3 securities as of December 31, 2011 . Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $3.0 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2011 . Included in the debt securities balance are $2.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2011 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $3.0 billion bank credit facility described below. As of December 31, 2011 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. Bank Credit Facility . In December 2011 , we amended and renewed our five-year revolving bank credit facility with 21 banks, which will mature in December 2016 . The amendment included increasing the borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion . This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011 . The interest rate on borrowings is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011 , the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.2% to 1.7% . Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, was 29.1% and 30.1% as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2011 . Long-term debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes and the funds may be used, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions, for share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes. In November 2011, we issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million of 1.9% fixed-rate notes due November 2016, $500 million of 3.4% fixed-rate notes due November 2021 and $600 million of 4.6% notes due November 2041. In February 2011, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million of 4.7% fixed-rate notes due February 2021 and $350 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2041. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Stable  A-  Positive  A-  Stable  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-2  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_END The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), subject to certain preset parameters established by our Board. In May 2011 , our Board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we repurchased 65 million shares at an average price of approximately $46 per share and an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion . As of December 31, 2011 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In May 2011 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2010 , we had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. On February 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share. The following table provides details of our dividend payments and annual dividend rate: ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31,  Amount Paid per Share  Total Amount Paid  Annual Dividend Rate per Share at December 31,     (in millions)    $ 0.0300  $  $ 0.03  0.4050   0.50  0.6125   0.65 ##TABLE_ENDCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2011 , under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2013 to 2014  2015 to 2016  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 1,580  $ 2,551  $ 2,437  $ 13,529  $ 20,097 Operating leases      1,601 Purchase obligations (b)      Future policy benefits (c)     1,917  2,570 Unrecognized tax benefits (d)        Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e)      2,459  2,669 Other obligations (f)      Total contractual obligations  $ 2,477  $ 3,441  $ 3,167  $ 18,610  $ 27,695 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. Coupon payments have been calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2011 , we were not involved in off-balance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06, Other Expenses (Topic 720): Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2011-06). This update addresses the recognition and classification of an entity's share of the annual health insurance industry assessment (the fee) mandated by Health Reform Legislation. The fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entity's net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year. In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2011-06, our liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once we provide qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable (first applicable in 2014) with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. We have determined that there have been no other recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $720 million , $800 million and $310 million , respectively. This development represented approximately 8%, 9% and 4% of the medical claims payable balance as of December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2011 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (70 ) 0.50  (139 ) 0.75  (208 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2011 :  ##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (138 ) (2)  (277 ) (3)  (415 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2011 , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2011 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2011 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2011 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $56 million and diluted net earnings per common share would have increased or decreased by $0.05 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Effective in 2011, premium revenue subject to the premium rebates of the Health Reform Legislation are recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, when that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium is revised each period to reflect current experience. The most significant factors in estimating these rebates are financial performance within each aggregation set, including medical claim experience and effective tax rates, as well as changes in business mix and regulatory requirements. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and other health care plans collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS' retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Medicare Advantage risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered. ##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and \"Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\" above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2012. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2011. Intangible assets. Finite-lived, separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). We do not have material holdings of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles which represent 88% of our total intangible balance of $2.8 billion . Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). Our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of an intangible asset, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. There were no material impairments of finite-lived intangible assets during 2011. Investments As of December 31, 2011 , we had investments with a carrying value of $18.7 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders' equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2011 , our investments had gross unrealized gains of $787 million and gross unrealized losses of $32 million . We evaluate investments for impairment considering factors including: ##TABLE_START  our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. ##TABLE_END 47 For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security's cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in through our income statement. Inherently, there is uncertainty included in the impairment assessment of investments. Our analysis includes significant judgments and estimates including: the fair value of the investment, the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the issuer other forms of credit enhancements, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and general industry and sector economic conditions. Fair values. We perform an analysis around the fair values of the securities held including obtaining an understanding of the pricing method and procedures over the valuation of securities. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: ##TABLE_START  the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. ##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the factors above including: the length of time of impairment, credit standing, financial condition, near term-prospects and other factors specific to the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, the primary causes of historical impairments were market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Generally, we do not assume that we will be required  to sell a security because our large cash holdings reduce this risk. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $12 million , $23 million and $64 million , respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2011. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $622 million . Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2011 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $80 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2011 , we had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A+. As of December 31, 2011 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2011 , $9.4 billion of our investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, OptumHealth Bank held $1.4 billion of deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2011 at interest rates that vary with market rates. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011 , $18.2 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $11.6 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. In the second half of 2011, we terminated all of our interest rate swap fair value hedges with a $5.4 billion notional amount in order to lock-in the impact of low market floating interest rates and reduce the effective interest rate on hedged long-term debt. The gain of $132 million will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed-rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additional information on our interest rate swaps is included in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the interest rate swaps have been terminated, the fair value of our long-term debt is now more sensitive to hypothetical changes in interest rates as the change in the fair value of the debt is no longer offset by the swaps. Also as a result of the swaps' termination, our exposure to hypothetical changes in market rates on our interest expense is less volatile. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments (b)  Fair Value of Debt 2 %  $  $  $ (1,239 )  $ (1,946 )    (622 )  (1,082 ) (1)  (12 )  (4 )   1,086 (2)  nm  nm   2,343 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments  Fair Value of Debt 2 %  $  $  $ (1,177 )  $ (860 )    (602 )  (471 ) (1)  (10 )  (21 )   (2)  nm  nm  1,227  1,240 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful  ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 2% point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2011 , some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 2% point reduction. ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2011 , we had $544 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments. ", "8": " ITEM 8.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (also referred to as UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and make health care work better.  The Company helps individuals access quality care at an affordable cost; simplifying health care administration and delivery; strengthening the physician/patient relationship; promoting evidence-based care; and empowering physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in the health system with actionable data to make better, more informed decisions. Through the Company's diversified family of businesses, it leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. 2. Basis of Presentation , Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions. During the first quarter of 2011 , the Company renamed its reportable segments to conform to the naming conventions of its market facing businesses. Consequently, the Health Benefits reportable segment is now UnitedHealthcare, and the health services businesses, OptumHealth, Ingenix, and Prescriptions Solutions, are now aligned under Optum as OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx, respectively. On January 1, 2011, the Company realigned certain of its businesses to respond to changes in the markets it serves and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, OptumHealths results of operations now include the Companys clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi-specialty clinics in Nevada and Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals results of operations now include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. The Companys reportable segments remain the same and prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to medical costs payable and medical costs, premium rebates and risk-sharing provisions related to revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, other policy liabilities, other current receivables, valuation of investments, income taxes and contingent liabilities. These estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any changes in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs. Effective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its related reconciliation act (Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. The Company classifies its estimated rebates as an offset to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from its customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its collaborative care businesses. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Company's plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependants. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependants, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. For the Company's OptumRx pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company's mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized always exclude the member's applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Company's mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care rendered through OptumHealth.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The Company had checks outstanding in excess of bank deposits at the related accounts of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 , which were classified as Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the change in this balance has been reflected as Checks Outstanding in Excess of Bank Deposits within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company does not net checks outstanding with deposits in other accounts. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from earnings and reports them, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders' equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company uses the specific cost or amortized cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company's intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. ##TABLE_START  For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in Investment and Other Income. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  For equity securities, the Company recognizes impairments in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the security's cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the impairment in Investment and Other Income. ##TABLE_END New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program), and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. The Company's arrangements with AARP extend to December 31, 2017 for the AARP Program and give the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D offerings until December 31, 2014, subject to certain limited exclusions. Pursuant to the Company's agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Company's earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the RSF and were $99 million , $107 million and $99 million in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. The effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see \"Other Policy Liabilities\" below. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Company's PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers' products by its PBM businesses' affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of Product Revenue. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. For details on the Company's Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. For details on the Company's reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the member's monthly premiums to the Company on the member's behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the member's behalf some or all of a member's cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Company's annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Policy Liabilities or Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. Beginning in 2011, Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount of 50% on brand name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Company's insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and therefore are recorded as Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in Unearned Revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in Medical Costs and Operating Costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2011 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2012, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $   $  $   $   $  Other policy liabilities      ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 1, 2012, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START  The initial coverage limit increased to $2,930 from $2,840 in 2011. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,658 as compared to $6,448 in 2011. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The annual out-of-pocket maximum increased to $4,700 from $4,550 in 2011. ##TABLE_END Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company reviews property, equipment and capitalized software for events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that it might not recover their carrying value. If the Company determines that an asset may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded.  The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 7 years or length of lease term, whichever is shorter Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDGoodwill Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if the Company elects to proceed directly with quantitative testing, it will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting-unit fair value assessment and completed its annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2012. As of December 31, 2011 , no reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value and the Company concluded that there was no need for any impairment of its goodwill balances. Intangible assets Finite-lived, separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). The Company does not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company's intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives. The Company's intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given to a number of potential impairment indicators. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, to determine whether an impairment exists, the Company would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. Once it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment. There were no material impairments of finite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program (described below), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under the Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customer's option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Program are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. Changes in the RSF are reported in Medical Costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the balance in the RSF was $1.3 billion . The Company believes the RSF balance as of December 31, 2011 is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Company's Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $125 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.8 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010 , the Company had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $126 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.9 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A+. Policy Acquisition Costs The Company's short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be cancelled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred.  Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted shares, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Recent Accounting Standards Recently Issued Accounting Standards. In July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06, Other Expenses (Topic 720): Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2011-06). This update addresses the recognition and classification of an entity's share of the annual health insurance industry assessment (the fee) mandated by Health Reform Legislation. The fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entity's net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year. In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2011-06, the liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once the Company provides qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable (first applicable in 2014) with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011-08). This update intends to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment by including an option for entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test on the subject reporting unit. The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2011-08 for its annual goodwill impairment test as of January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently issued or adopted accounting standards that will have or had a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START 3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its investments that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses on investments in state and municipal obligations and corporate obligations as of December 31, 2011 were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the state and municipal obligations and the corporate obligations, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). As of December 31, 2011 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 2011 , the Companys holdings of non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities included $7 million of commercial mortgage loans in default. They represented less than 1% of the Companys total mortgage-backed security holdings as of December 31, 2011 . A portion of the Companys investments in equity securities and venture capital funds consists of investments held in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care services and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care and related technology stocks will likewise impact the value of the Companys equity portfolio. The equity securities and venture capital funds were evaluated for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains included in Investment and Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total OTTI  $ (12 )  $ (23 )  $ (64 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       Net OTTI recognized in earnings  (12 )  (23 )  (64 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (11 )  (6 )  (41 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDFor the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , all of the recorded OTTI charges resulted from the Companys intent to sell certain impaired securities. ##TABLE_START 4. Fair Value ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the financial statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by U.S. GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, non-current prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, default rates); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding AARP related assets and liabilities: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value December 31, 2011         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 8,569  $  $   $ 9,429 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,551     2,373 State and municipal obligations    6,750   6,765 Corporate obligations   5,805   6,007 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,353    2,353 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,567  16,227   18,002 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Total assets at fair value $ 10,469  $ 17,089  $  $ 27,975 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % December 31, 2010         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 8,069  $ 1,054  $   $ 9,123 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,515     2,234 State and municipal obligations    6,148    6,148 Corporate obligations   5,146   5,310 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    1,903    1,903 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,546  14,373   16,060 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at fair value  9,921  15,429   25,699 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value  $ 9,921  $ 15,475  $  $ 25,745 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThere were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 .

The table below includes fair values for certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. The carrying values and fair values of these financial instruments were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010 (in millions)  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Assets         Debt securities - available-for-sale  $ 18,002  $ 18,002  $ 16,060  $ 16,060 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Debt securities - held-to-maturity     AARP Program-related investments  2,441  2,441  2,435  2,435 Interest rate swap assets       Liabilities         Senior unsecured notes  11,638  13,149  10,212  10,903 Interest rate swap liabilities       AARP Program-related other liabilities     ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other current receivables, unearned revenues, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table above. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source, prices reported by its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. The Companys Level 3 debt securities consist mainly of low income housing investments that are unique and non-transferable. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using market modeling approaches that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. These investments totaled $168 million and $166 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The key inputs utilized in the Companys market modeling include, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries and having similar revenue and growth characteristics; similar preferences in the capital structure; discounted cash flows; liquidation values and milestones established at initial funding; and the assumption that the values of the Companys venture capital investments can be inferred from these inputs. The Companys remaining Level 3 equity securities holdings of $41 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, consist of preferred stock and other items for which there are no active markets. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company's processes for validating third party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys interest rate swaps were estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available market yield curves. Because the swaps were unique and not actively traded, the fair values were classified as Level 2. AARP Program-related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt and equity securities held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys other securities. Senior Unsecured Notes. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes are estimated based on third-party quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. AARP Program-related Other Liabilities. AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs is as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010  December 31, 2009 (in millions)  Debt Securities  Equity Securities  Total  Debt Securities  Equity Securities  Total  Debt Securities  Equity Securities  Total Balance at beginning of period  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ Purchases          Sales    (17 )  (17 )  (4 )  (167 )  (171 )    (3 )  (3 ) Settlements  (25 )  (7 )  (32 )  (20 )    (20 )  (12 )    (12 ) Net unrealized (losses) gains in accumulated other comprehensive income    (4 )  (4 )         Net realized (losses) gains in investment and other income    (6 )  (6 )     (6 )  (21 )  (27 ) Balance at end of period  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDNon-financial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by reportable segment, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  UnitedHealthcare  OptumHealth  OptumInsight  OptumRx  Consolidated Balance at January 1, 2010 (a)  $ 17,851  $  $ 1,463  $  $ 20,727 Acquisitions     2,022    2,209 Impairments      (172 )    (172 ) Adjustments, net  (14 )    (5 )    (19 ) Balance at December 31, 2010  17,837   3,308   22,745 Acquisitions   1,353      1,454 Dispositions  (2 )    (214 )    (216 ) Adjustments, net  (4 )    (4 )    (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2011  $ 17,932  $ 2,113  $ 3,090  $  $ 23,975 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Prior period reportable segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END In 2010, there was a decline in the economic environment and competitive landscape for the clinical trial support businesses within one of the OptumInsight reporting units. These businesses experienced unexpected declines in new business authorizations from historical levels including continued delays in and lengthening of the selling cycle. During this time the Company began evaluating strategic options with respect to the clinical trial support businesses. In December 2010, as part of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company considered the aforementioned market conditions and operating results as well as indications of interest the Company began to receive on the clinical trial support businesses as the fair value of the reporting unit was evaluated. As a result of that analysis, the Company determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and an impairment charge of $172 million was recorded. The implied fair value of the reporting unit was determined by a combination of valuation techniques, including discounting future expected cash flows and expected sale proceeds. The Company sold a significant portion of this reporting unit in 2011 resulting in a reduction of goodwill upon disposal. The gross carrying value, accumulated amortization and net carrying value of other intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011  December 31, 2010 (in millions)  Gross Carrying Value  Accumulated Amortization  Net Carrying Value  Gross Carrying Value  Accumulated Amortization  Net Carrying Value Customer-related  $ 3,766  $ (1,310 )  $ 2,456  $ 3,623  $ (1,038 )  $ 2,585 Trademarks and technology   (98 )    (246 )  Other   (43 )    (66 )  Total  $ 4,246  $ (1,451 )  $ 2,795  $ 4,260  $ (1,350 )  $ 2,910 ##TABLE_ENDThe acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations consisted of the following by year of acquisition: ##TABLE_START    (in millions, except years)  Fair Value  Weighted-Average Useful Life  Fair Value  Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related  $  9 years  $  14 years Trademarks and technology   5 years   8 years Other   15 years   9 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets  $  9 years  $  13 years ##TABLE_END Estimated full year amortization expense relating to intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Estimated Amortization Expense   $ 2013  2014  2015  2016  ##TABLE_ENDAmortization expense relating to intangible assets for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $361 million , $317 million and $241 million , respectively. ##TABLE_START 7. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable ##TABLE_END For the year ended December 31, 2011 , there was $720 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2011 was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which results in higher completion factors, and lower than expected health system utilization levels. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , there was $800 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels; more efficient claims handling and processing, which results in higher completion factors; a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. No factor (e.g., medical trends/utilization, completion factors) was individually material to the $310 million of net favorable medical cost development for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Medical costs payable, beginning of period  $ 9,220  $ 9,362  $ 8,664 Acquisitions     Reported medical costs:       Current year  75,052  69,641  65,599 Prior years  (720 )  (800 )  (310 ) Total reported medical costs  74,332  68,841  65,289 Claim payments:       Payments for current year  (65,763 )  (60,949 )  (57,109 ) Payments for prior year  (8,145 )  (8,034 )  (7,734 ) Total claim payments  (73,908 )  (68,983 )  (64,843 ) Medical costs payable, end of period  $ 9,799  $ 9,220  $ 9,362 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 8.

In December 2011 , the Company amended and renewed its five-year revolving bank credit facility with 21 banks, which will mature in December 2016 . The amendment included increasing the capacity to $3.0 billion . This facility supports the Companys commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011 . The interest rate on borrowings is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011 , the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.2% to 1.7% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facility contains various covenants including requiring the Company to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, below 50% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2011 . Interest Rate Swap Contracts During 2010 , the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed to floating rates. The interest rate swap contracts were benchmarked to LIBOR and were utilized to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on the Company's cash equivalent and investment balances. The swaps were designated as fair value hedges on fixed-rate debt issues maturing between November 2012 through March 2016 and June 2017 through October 2020 . Since the specific terms and notional amounts of the swaps matched those of the debt being hedged, they were assumed to be highly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the swaps were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table provides a summary of the effect of changes in fair value of fair value hedges, prior to their termination, on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (in millions)   Hedge gain recognized in interest expense  $  $ (58 ) Hedged item loss recognized in interest expense  (190 )  Net impact on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations  $   $  ##TABLE_ENDIn the second half of 2011, the Company terminated all of its interest rate swap fair value hedges ( $5.4 billion notional amount). As of the swap contracts' termination dates, the aggregate favorable adjustments to the carrying value of the Company's debt of $132 million is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining lives of the underlying debt obligations, which had in total a weighted-average life of 4.1 years. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the net impact of the gain amortization was not material. The purpose of the interest rate swap terminations was to lock-in the impact of low market floating interest rates and reduce the effective interest rate on hedged long-term debt. ##TABLE_START 9. Income Taxes ##TABLE_END The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 2,608  $ 2,524  $ 1,924 State and local    Total current provision  2,758  2,704  2,002 Deferred provision    (16 ) Total provision for income taxes  $ 2,817  $ 2,749  $ 1,986 ##TABLE_ENDThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. Federal Statutory Rate to the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 2,785  35.0 %  $ 2,584  35.0 %  $ 2,033  35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.7   1.7   1.1 Settlement of state exams, net of federal benefit  (29 )  (0.4 )  (3 )    (40 )  (0.7 ) Tax-exempt investment income  (63 )  (0.8 )  (65 )  (0.9 )  (70 )  (1.2 ) Non-deductible compensation   0.1   0.9     Other, net  (22 )  (0.2 )   0.5  (3 )   Provision for income taxes  $ 2,817  35.4 %  $ 2,749  37.2 %  $ 1,986  34.2 % ##TABLE_ENDThe lower effective income tax rates for 2011 and 2009 as compared to 2010 resulted from the favorable resolution of various tax matters as well as higher effective income tax rates in 2010. The 2010 effective income tax rates were at higher levels due to the cumulative implementation of changes under the Health Reform Legislation.  The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Share-based compensation  $  $ Accrued expenses and allowances   Net operating loss carryforwards   Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   Long term liabilities   Unearned revenues   Unrecognized tax benefits   Other   Subtotal  1,536  1,507 Less: valuation allowances  (184 )  (247 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,352  1,260 Deferred income tax liabilities:     Intangible assets  (1,148 )  (1,104 ) Capitalized software development  (465 )  (450 ) Net unrealized gains on investments  (275 )  (161 ) Depreciation and amortization  (256 )  (140 ) Prepaid expenses  (86 )  (92 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities  (2,230 )  (1,947 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (878 )  $ (687 ) ##TABLE_ENDValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $151 million expire beginning in 2019 through 2031, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2012 through 2031. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions    Prior year tax positions    Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (34 )    (62 ) Settlements  (25 )    (61 ) Statute of limitations lapses  (53 )  (43 )  (18 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , the Company recognized a tax benefit of $12 million generated from the net reduction in interest and penalties accrued. During the year ended December 31, 2010 , the Company recognized $15 million of interest expense and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2009 , the Company recognized a tax benefit of $7 million generated from the net reduction in interest accrued. The Company had $41 million and $63 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2011 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, was $90 million . The Company currently files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 and prior. The Company's 2011 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to 2004. The Company does not believe any adjustments that may result from these examinations will be significant. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $73 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. ##TABLE_START 10. Shareholders Equity ##TABLE_END Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Company's regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2011, based on the 2010 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.4 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the Company's regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , the Company's regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2011 , $1.6 billion of the Company's $9.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents was held by non-regulated entities. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $12 billion as of December 31, 2011 ; regulated entity statutory capital exceeded state minimum capital requirements. OptumHealth Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2011 , the Company believes that OptumHealth Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In May 2011 , the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of its common stock. During 2011 , the Company repurchased 65 million shares at an average price of approximately $46 per share and an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion . As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of its common stock. Dividends In May 2011 , the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2010 , the Company had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. On February 8, 2012 , the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share. The following table provides details of the Companys dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date  Amount per Share  Total Amount Paid     (in millions)  $ 0.0300  $ 2010  0.4050  2011  0.6125  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 11. Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END In May 2011 , the Companys shareholders approved the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan). The Plan is intended to attract and retain employees and non-employee directors, offer them incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Companys business and afford them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The Plan allows the Company to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards or other stock-based awards to eligible employees and non-employee directors. The Plan incorporates the following plans adopted by the Company: 2002 Stock and Incentive Plan, 1991 Stock and Incentive Plan, 1998 Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan. All outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other awards issued under the prior plans will remain subject to the terms and conditions of the plans under which they were issued. As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had 50 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs and up to 23 million of awards in restricted shares. The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. Stock Options and SARs Stock options and SARs vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value  (in millions)    (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period  $     Granted      Exercised (18 )      Forfeited (4 )      Outstanding at end of period   4.7  $ Exercisable at end of period   4.1  Vested and expected to vest end of period   4.7  ##TABLE_ENDTo determine compensation expense related to the Companys stock options and SARs, the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. The principal assumptions the Company used in applying the option-pricing model were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Risk free interest rate 0.9% - 2.3%  1.0% - 2.1%  1.7%-2.4% Expected volatility 44.3% - 45.1%  45.4% - 46.2%  41.3% - 46.8% Expected dividend yield 1.0% - 1.4%  0.1% - 1.7%  0.1% Forfeiture rate 5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years 4.9 - 5.0  4.6 - 5.1  4.4 - 5.1 ##TABLE_ENDRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share dividend declared by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and SARs granted for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was approximately $15 per share, $13 per share and $10 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $327 million , $164 million and $282 million , respectively. Restricted Shares Restricted shares vest ratably over three to four years. Compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period   $ Granted   Vested  (3 )  Forfeitures  (1 )  Nonvested at end of period   ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was approximately $42 per share, $32 per share and $29 per share, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $113 million , $99 million and $56 million , respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is intended to enhance employee commitment to the goals of the Company, by providing a means of achieving stock ownership at advantageous terms to eligible employees of the Company. Eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company's stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Company's common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. During 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , 3 million shares, 4 million shares and 4 million shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP. The compensation expense is included in the compensation expense amounts recognized and discussed below. As of December 31, 2011 , there were 22 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Share-Based Compensation Recognition The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, SARs and restricted shares, on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. For 2011 , 2010 and 2009 the Company recognized compensation expense related to its share-based compensation plans of $401 million ( $260 million net of tax effects), $326 million ( $278 million net of tax effects) and $334 million ( $220 million net of tax effects), respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recognized in Operating Costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2011 , there was $387 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. For 2011 , 2010 and 2009 the income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises was $170 million , $78 million and $94 million , respectively. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for all employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 .  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within Long-Term Investments with an approximately equal amount in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $281 million and $258 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 12. Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_END The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates through 2028. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $295 million , $297 million and $303 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2011 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2013  2014  2015  2016  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its performance under certain contracts. If standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. Amounts accrued for performance guarantees were not material as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 . As of December 31, 2011 , the Company has outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $72 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $316 million , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, providers, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys management and administration of health benefit plans. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims, and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters Out-of-Network Reimbursement Litigation. In 2000, a group of plaintiffs including the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the Company asserting a variety of claims challenging the Companys determination of reimbursement amounts for non-network health care services based on the Companys use of a database previously maintained by Ingenix, Inc. (now known as OptumInsight). The parties entered into a settlement agreement in 2009 and this class action lawsuit, along with a related industry-wide investigation by the New York Attorney General, is now resolved. The Company remains a party to a number of other lawsuits challenging the determination of out of network reimbursement amounts based on use of the same database, including putative class actions and multidistrict litigation brought on behalf of members of Aetna and WellPoint. The Company was dismissed as a party from a similar lawsuit involving Cigna and its members. These suits allege, among other things, that the database licensed to these companies by Ingenix was flawed and that Ingenix conspired with these companies to underpay their members claims and seek unspecified damages and treble damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, interest, costs and attorneys fees. The Company is vigorously defending these suits. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters due to the procedural status of the cases, motions to dismiss that are pending in several of the cases, the absence of class certification in any of the cases, the lack of a formal demand on the Company by the plaintiffs, and the involvement of other insurance companies as defendants. California Claims Processing Matter.  In 2007, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) examined the Companys PacifiCare health insurance plan in California. The examination findings related to the timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, provider contract implementation, provider dispute resolution and other related matters. On January 25, 2008, the CDI issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations in connection with the CDIs examination findings. On June 3, 2009, the Company filed a Notice of Defense to the Order to Show Cause denying all material allegations and asserting certain defenses. The matter has been the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge since December 2009. CDI amended its Order to Show Cause three times in 2010 to allege a total of 992,936 violations, the large majority of which relate to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence during a four month period in 2007. Although we believe that CDI has never issued an aggregate penalty in excess of $8 million , CDI has previously alleged in press reports and releases that the Company could theoretically be subject to penalties of up to $10,000 per violation. In October 2011, CDI stated that it is seeking an average penalty of approximately $326 per alleged violation. CDI has since reduced the number of alleged violations to 919,574 but has indicated that it is still seeking an aggregate penalty of approximately $325 million . The Company is vigorously defending against the claims in this matter and believes that the penalty requested by CDI is excessive and without merit. After the administrative law judge issues a ruling at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, expected sometime in 2012, the California Insurance Commissioner may accept, reject or modify the administrative law judge's ruling, issue his own decision, and impose a fine or penalty. The Commissioner's decision is subject to challenge in court. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the novel legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory fines and penalties, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event a fine or penalty is assessed. Government Regulation The Companys business is regulated at federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing the Companys business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Further, the Company must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market and sell many of its products. The Company has been and is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other governmental authorities. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2011, CMS conducted an audit of the Company's Medicare Advantage and Part D business. The Company is in the process of responding to preliminary findings. Other examples of audits include the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits discussed below and a review by the U.S. Department of Labor of the Companys administration of applicable customer employee benefit plans with respect to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) compliance. Government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits. CMS adjusts capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as, for Medicare Part D plans only, based on comparing costs predicted in the Company's annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers, who the Company generally relies on to appropriately code their claim submissions and document their medical records. CMS then determines the risk score and payment amount for each enrolled member based on the health care data submitted and member demographic information. In 2008, CMS announced that it would perform RADV audits of selected Medicare Advantage health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers and may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. Certain of the Companys health plans have been selected for audit. These audits are focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for 2006 that were used to determine 2007 payment amounts. Although these audits are ongoing, the Company does not believe they will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2010 , CMS published for public comment a new proposed RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples. The Company has submitted comments to CMS regarding concerns the Company has with CMS proposed methodology. These concerns include, among others, the fact that the proposed methodology does not take into account the error rate in the original Medicare fee-for-service data that was used to develop the risk adjustment system. Additionally, payments received from CMS, as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members, are based on actuarially certified bids that did not include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. The Company believes that applying retroactive audit and payment adjustments after CMS acceptance of bids undermines the actuarial soundness of the bids. On February 3, 2011 , CMS notified the Company that CMS was evaluating all comments received on the proposed methodology and that it anticipated making changes to the draft, based on input CMS had received. As of the date of this filing, CMS has not published the revised methodology. Depending on the methodology utilized, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Office of Inspector General for HHS has audited our risk adjustment data for two local plans and has initially communicated its findings. While the Company does not believe OIG has governing authority to directly impose payment adjustments for risk adjustment audits of Medicare health plans operated under the regulatory authority of CMS, the OIG can recommend to CMS a proposed payment adjustment, and the Company is unable to predict the outcome of this audit process. Guaranty Fund Assessments. Under state guaranty assessment laws, certain insurance companies (and health maintenance organizations in some states), including those issuing health (which includes long-term care), life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments are generally based on premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers, and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and has petitioned a state court for liquidation. If Penn Treaty is liquidated, the Companys insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treatys policyholder claims through guaranty association assessments in future periods. The Company has estimated a potential assessment of $250 million to $350 million related to this matter, and the Company would accrue the assessment in operating costs if and when the state court renders such a decision. The timing, actual amount and impact, if any, of any guaranty fund assessments will depend on several factors, including if and when the court declares Penn Treaty insolvent, the amount of the insolvency, the availability and amount of any potential offsets, such as an offset of any premium taxes otherwise payable by the Company, and the impact of any such assessments on potential premium rebate payments under the Health Reform Legislation. ##TABLE_START 13. Segment Financial Information ##TABLE_END Factors used in determining the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision-maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company's reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State because they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes and operate in a similar regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  State provides health plans and care programs to beneficiaries of acute and long-term care Medicaid plans, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Special Needs Plans and other federal and state health care programs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling consumer health management and collaborative care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers personalized health management services, decision support services, access to networks of care provider specialists, well-being solutions, behavioral health management solutions, financial services and clinical services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight is a health information, technology, services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services, and business process outsourcing to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system work with OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers a multitude of pharmacy benefit management services including providing prescribed medications, patient support and clinical programs. OptumRx also provides claims processing, retail network contracting, rebate contracting and management and clinical programs, such as step therapy, formulary management and disease/drug therapy management programs to achieve a low-cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital or working capital for non-regulated businesses. Substantially all of the Companys assets are held and operations are conducted in the United States. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 28% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 27% for both the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 , most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. Prior period reportable segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate and intersegment eliminations are presented to reconcile the reportable segment results to the consolidated results.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2011 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2011 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2011  The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2011 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 .  ##TABLE_START /s/ STEPHEN J.

Rangen Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer ##TABLE_ENDFebruary 8, 2012   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2011 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and help make health care work better (the terms we, our, us, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and our subsidiaries). We are helping individuals access quality care at an affordable cost; simplifying health care administration and delivery; strengthening the physician/patient relationship; promoting evidence-based care; and empowering physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in the health system with actionable data to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides network-based health care benefits for a full spectrum of customers in the health benefits market. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, as well as students and other individuals, and will serve TRICARE West Region members beginning April 1, 2013. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community  State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare International includes Amil Participaes S.A (Amil), a health care company providing health benefits and hospital and clinical services to individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, government, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that drive improved delivery, quality and cost effectiveness across eight business markets: integrated care delivery, care management, consumer engagement and support, distribution of benefits and services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2012, we managed nearly $150 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the constituents and consumers we served. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcare is advancing strategies to improve the way health care is delivered and financed, offering consumers a simpler, more affordable health care experience. Our market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  a national scale; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of our product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END 1 ##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a commitment to innovation. ##TABLE_END The financial results of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International have been aggregated in the UnitedHealthcare reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods, operational processes and regulatory environment. The domestic businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as OptumRx pharmacy benefit products and services, certain OptumHealth product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services and OptumInsight health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services. UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include a total of nearly 780,000 physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 5,900 hospitals and other facilities across the United States (UnitedHealthcare Network). UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual works closely with employers and individuals to provide health benefit plans that provide solutions to help members live healthier lives and achieve meaningful cost savings. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide, providing nearly 27 million Americans access to health care as of December 31, 2012 . Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependants, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides customized services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. Large employer groups, such as those serviced by UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts, typically use self-funded arrangements. As of December 31, 2012 , UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual National Accounts served 395 large employer groups under these arrangements, including 147 of the Fortune 500 companies. Smaller employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or able to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. As the commercial market becomes more consumer-oriented, individuals are assuming more personal and financial responsibility for their care, and they are demanding more affordable products, greater transparency and choice and personalized help navigating the complex system. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals. Individuals served by UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual have access to 91% of the physicians and other health care professionals and 95% of the hospitals in the broad UnitedHealthcare Network; certain care providers are available only to those consumers served through Medicare and/or Medicaid products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is engaging physicians and consumers and using information to promote well-informed health decisions, improved medical outcomes and greater efficiency. It offers consumers engaging and informative tools and resources that provide greater transparency around quality and cost, such as the Premium Designation program and Health4Me for Apple and Android phones, myHealthcareCost Estimator, Health Care Lane and myuhc.com. These easy-to-use resources support better consumer decisions, affording members more control over their health care. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals distribution system consists primarily of producers (i.e., brokers and agents) and direct and internet sales in the individual market, producers in the small employer group market, and consultant-based or direct sales for larger employer and public sector segments. In recent years, the distribution model has been diversified to include professional employer organizations, associations, and private equity partners. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third party administrators (TPAs).

UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual emphasizes local markets and leverages its national scale to adapt products quickly to meet specific market needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals major product families include: Traditional Products.

The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products and Tools. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase employee ownership of their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer activation services such as personalized multi-channel activation messaging, behavioral incentive programs and consumer education information. During 2012, nearly 42,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including more than 200 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased an HRA or HSA product. The consumer engagement tools provide members with online and/or mobile access to benefit, cost and quality information. Value-Based Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals suite of consumer incentive products increases individual awareness for heightened consumer responsibility and behavior change across diverse client segments and funding relationships. Examples include: Small Business Wellness, which is a packaged wellness and incentives product offering gym reimbursement and encouraging completion of important wellness activities. For mid-sized clients, SimplyEngaged is a scalable activity-based reward program that ties incentives to completion of health improvement activities, while SimplyEngaged Plus provides richer incentives for achieving health outcome goals. For large, self-funded customers, UnitedHealthcare Health Rewards program offers a flexible incentive design for employers to choose the right activities and biometric outcomes that best fit the needs of their population. Additionally, UnitedHealth Personal Rewards leverages a tailored approach to incentives by combining personalized scorecards with financial incentives for improving biometric scores, compliance with key health treatments and preventive care. Essential Benefits Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals portfolio of affordable products drives value to consumers with lower-cost products, innovative designs and unique network programs that guide people to physicians recognized for providing quality and cost efficient care to their patients. These approaches are designed to deliver sustainable health care costs, enabling employers to continue to offer their employees coverage at more affordable prices. Products such as Catalyst, Edge, Premium Tiered Benefit Plan, Navigate and CORE offer solutions for employers looking to achieve more affordable costs through tiered benefit plans that enhance benefits in the form of greater coinsurance coverage and/or lower copays for using UnitedHealth Premium designated providers. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefit management programs. The clinical and pharmacy benefit products complement the service offering by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options.

Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured and self-funded), line of business (Individual, Small Business, Key Accounts, Public Sector, and National Accounts), and clinical need. The spectrum of clinical programs offered to all consumers, regardless of their health goals  staying healthy, getting healthy, living with a chronic condition includes: wellness, decision support, utilization management, case and disease management, and complex condition management, workplace on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots, incentives to reinforce positive behavior change, mental health, substance use disorder management, employer assistance programs and well-being programs. The programs promote consumer engagement, health education, admission counseling before hospital stays, care advocacy to help avoid prolonged patients stays in the hospital, support for individuals at risk of needing intensive treatment and coordination of care for people with chronic conditions.

OptumHealths solutions reduce costs for customers, improve workforce productivity and consumer satisfaction and optimize the overall health and well-being of populations.

As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and integrated care delivery businesses. OptumHealth is organized into three major operating groups: Care Management, Integrated Care Delivery and Consumer Solutions. Care Management. Care Management includes Specialty Networks and Health Management Solutions. ##TABLE_START  Specialty Networks: Within Specialty Networks, OptumHealth serves over 55 million people in two primary ways: 1) creating access to networks of provider specialists in the areas of behavioral health management (e.g., mental health, substance abuse), global well-being (e.g., international work/life solutions), chronic physical health management (e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy), and complex medical conditions (e.g., transplant, infertility); and 2) managing the care and health needs for consumers through a variety of programs utilizing predictive modeling, evidence-based clinical outcomes management and peer support. Specialty Networks addresses areas likely to have significant variation in clinical practice, where a disciplined, evidence-based approach can drive improved health outcomes and reduced costs. These range from relatively commonly accessed services (e.g., behavioral health and chiropractic) to less common procedures such as transplant, infertility, bariatric surgery and kidney disease/end stage renal disease. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health Management Solutions: OptumHealth serves more than 40 million people with population health management solutions (e.g., care management and advocacy, health and wellness, and complex conditions including cancer, neonatal and maternity) and decision support solutions (e.g., insurance choices and treatment and health care provider options). This comprehensive solution set empowers consumers to take more control of their health and well-being and enables their collaboration with specialty care providers, which is critical to decisions that drive medical costs, including hospitalization and surgery. ##TABLE_END Integrated Care Delivery. Integrated Care Delivery is defined by the types of care delivery support services provided within OptumHealths two businesses: Collaborative Care and Logistics Health, Inc. (LHI). Collaborative Care is driven by the recognition that the market is moving to a collaborative network aligned around the concept of total population health management and outcomes based reimbursement. Collaborative Cares local care delivery systems deploy a core set of technology, risk management, analytical and clinical capabilities and tools to assist physicians in delivering high-quality care across the populations they serve. Collaborative Cares complex population management services augment primary care physicians to deliver services outside of hospitals to vulnerable, chronically ill populations.

As of December 31, 2012 , Financial Services had $1.8 billion in customer assets under management and during 2012 processed $66 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. ##TABLE_END OptumInsight OptumInsight is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services, and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system work with OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. As of December 31, 2012 , OptumInsights products and services are used by four out of five hospitals, tens of thousands of physician practices and other health care facilities, approximately 300 health plans, nearly 400 global life sciences companies, and many government agencies, as well as other UnitedHealth Group businesses. Many of OptumInsights software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements, and outsourcing contracts are performed over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2012 was $4.6 billion, of which $2.7 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $1.0 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services, the potential for cancellation, non-renewal, or early termination of service arrangements. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2011 was $4.0 billion.  OptumInsights products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliance and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface its products with their applications. OptumInsights technology products and services solutions are offered through four integrated market groups. These market groups are care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospitals), commercial payers, governments and life sciences. Care Providers.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being services are regulated by U.S. federal and state as well as non-U.S. regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Health Reform Legislation, were signed into law in the first quarter of 2010 and, after being challenged, were substantially upheld in a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the second quarter of 2012. The Health Reform Legislation, portions of which are summarized below, alters the regulatory environment in which we operate, in some cases to a significant degree. U.S. federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, as well as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. In the event we fail to comply with, or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Health Care Reforms The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), HHS and the U.S. Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending. The following outlines certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation that are currently effective, currently effective with phased implementation or are expected to take effect in the coming years. ##TABLE_START  Currently Effective : The Health Reform Legislation mandated the expansion of dependant coverage to include adult children until age 26; eliminated certain annual and lifetime caps on the dollar value of certain essential health benefits; eliminated pre-existing condition limits for enrollees under age 19; prohibited certain policy rescissions; prohibited plans and issuers from charging higher cost sharing (copayments or coinsurance) for emergency services that are obtained outside of a plans network; and included a requirement to provide coverage for preventive services without cost to members (for non-grandfathered plans). ##TABLE_END Commercial fully insured health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets with medical loss ratios below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations, subject to state specific exceptions) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. The Health Reform Legislation also mandated certain changes to coverage determination and appeals processes, including: expanding the definition of adverse benefit determination to include rescissions; extending external review rights of adverse benefit determinations to insured and self-funded plans; and improving the clarity of and expanding the types of information in adverse benefit determination notices. ##TABLE_START  Currently Effective with Phased Implementation : The Health Reform Legislation also mandated consumer discounts on brand name and generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These consumer discounts will gradually increase over the next several years, which will decrease consumer out-of-pocket drug spending within the coverage gap, shifting a portion of these costs to the plan sponsor. In 2012, the discount on brand name prescription drugs was 50% while the discount on generic prescription drugs was 14%. ##TABLE_END In addition, as required under the Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a federal premium rate review process, which generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10%. The regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increases subject to the new federal rate review process. The regulations clarify that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes, but plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that are scheduled to become active under the Health Reform Legislation in 2014. Under current regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets.  CMS reduced or froze benchmarks which affect our Medicare Advantage reimbursements from CMS between 2009 and 2011, and in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks began to take effect (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes continuing to be phased-in over the next one to five years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. In addition to other measures, quality bonuses may partially offset these anticipated benchmark reductions. CMS quality rating bonuses are paid to certain qualifying plans for a three year period that began in 2012. Quality bonuses are based upon STAR ratings at the local plan level, as determined by CMS, and are dependent on numerous factors, including member satisfaction and member behavior in the context of obtaining preventive screens. ##TABLE_START  Effective 2013 : Effective beginning in 2013 with respect to services performed after 2009, the Health Reform Legislation limits the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for insurance providers if at least 25% of the insurance providers gross premium revenue from health business is derived from health insurance plans that meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective 2013/2014 : The Health Reform Legislation provides for an increase in Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care program reimbursements for primary care services provided by primary care doctors (family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine) to 100% of the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014, and provides 100% federal financing for the difference in rates based on rates applicable on July 1, 2009. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Effective 2014 : A number of the provisions of the Health Reform Legislation are scheduled to take effect in 2014, including: an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion to be levied on the insurance industry in 2014 increasing to $14.3 billion by 2018 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes; a transitional reinsurance program ($25 billion over a three-year period), which will be funded by a $5.25 per member per month fee (as currently estimated by HHS), on all comprehensive lines of business (including risk-based and self-insured) with only insurance plans for individuals eligible for reinsurance recoveries; a permanent risk adjustment program designed to promote stability in the individual and small employer group marketplace by transferring funds among competing plans based on variance in risk populations; all individual and group health plans must offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis during annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods and cannot apply pre-existing condition exclusions or health status rating adjustments; all individual and small group plans must provide certain essential health benefits, with member cost-sharing limitations and no annual limits on essential benefits coverage; establishment of state-based exchanges for individuals and small employers as well as certain CHIP eligibles; a temporary risk corridor program that limits the losses and gains of insurers that offer products on exchanges; introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values to increase comparability of competing products on the exchanges and limit member cost-sharing obligations; and establishment of minimum medical loss ratio of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans, as calculated under rules that have not yet been issued. ##TABLE_END The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict revenue and enrollment growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium growth rates for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, expose us to an increased risk of liability (including increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations and contract interpretation) or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such changes. The Health Reform Legislation may also create new or expand existing opportunities for business growth, but due to its complexity, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the Health Reform Legislation and related matters. Other Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses, and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and OptumHealth businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS (or state agencies) for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care given to Medicare beneficiaries. Beginning in 2014, our commercial business may be subject to audit related to the risk adjustment and reinsurance data. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of audits by CMS. Our UnitedHealthcare reportable segment, through UnitedHealthcare Community  State, also has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations surrounding Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of the Health Reform Legislation. In addition, our UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans business and certain of Optums businesses hold contracts with federal agencies including the DoD and we are subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of these contracts. Certain of UnitedHealthcares and Optums businesses, such as UnitedHealthcares eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optums high acuity clinical workflow software, hearing aid products, and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the clinical research activities are also subject to laws and regulations outside of the United States that regulate clinical trials. Laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust also affect us. HIPAA, GLBA and Other Privacy and Security Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. HIPAA requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals. It also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. Federal regulations related to HIPAA include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us. Federal privacy and security requirements change frequently because of legislation, regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation. For example, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which significantly amends, and adds new privacy and security provisions to HIPAA and imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information. ARRA includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In January 2013, HHS issued its final regulations implementing the ARRA amendments to HIPAA and updating the HIPAA privacy, security and enforcement rules. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with HIPAA, GLBA and other privacy-related regulations. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the DOL as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. Additionally, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third-party claims administration services for health care plans. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, when implemented by states would require certain governance practices substantially similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expand insurance company and HMO risk and solvency assessment reporting. We expect that states will adopt these or similar measures over the next few years, expanding the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum medical loss ratios with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the Health Reform Legislation. We expect the states to continue to introduce and pass similar laws in 2013, and this will affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. In addition, some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, managed care organization (MCO), utilization review (UR) or TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practice and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker, and sales distributions laws and regulations. Our UnitedHealthcare Community  State, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and certain Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states), including those issuing health, long-term care, life and accident insurance policies, doing business in those states can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRxs mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. Privacy and Security Laws. States have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the GLBA. Like HIPAA, GLBA allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. A number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security-related regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Additionally, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. These laws, regulations and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses and operations are international in nature and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, among other matters. We have recently acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our acquisition of Amil subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries and regulation by Brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar (ANS), whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. For more information about the Amil acquisition, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Item 8, Financial Statements. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are also subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Audits and Investigations We have been and may in the future become involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the FTC, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Brazilian securities regulator, the Comisso de Valores Mobilirios (CVM), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Brazilian federal revenue service - the Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF), the DOL, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. Such government investigations, audits and reviews can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation, audit results or sanctions could adversely affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services while retaining our current business. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil, and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, competitors include CVS Caremark Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Catamaran Corporation. Our OptumHealth and OptumInsight reportable segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.  EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2012 , we employed approximately 133,000 individuals. We believe our employee relations are generally positive.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, plan, project, should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. If we fail to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under our risk-based benefit product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of these products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for certain health plans and authorized HHS to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans, which could make it more difficult for us to price our products competitively. See the risk factor below relating to health care reform for further discussion of these provisions. In addition, our OptumHealth Collaborative Care business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to accurately predict, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period; however, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2012 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately $215 million, excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated; new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations, and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, utilization review and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims, debt collection and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty fund laws, certain health, life and accident insurance companies and, in certain cases, HMOs can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business in these states, which would expose our business to the risk of insolvency of a competitor in these states. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, some of which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, FDA regulations, state telemedicine regulations and state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and fee-splitting rules, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. Additionally, OptumHealth participates in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and/or managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government, and a number of states have enhanced (or are proposing to enhance) their rate review processes. In addition, geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political, economic, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction. The regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, investment, management control, labor relations, fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by U.S.-based businesses. We have recently acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States. For example, our acquisition of Amil in October 2012 subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries, which vary from comparable U.S. laws and regulations, and regulation by Brazilian regulators, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. For more information about the Amil acquisition, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are also subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or foster an increasingly active regulatory environment, which, in turn, could further increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and our costs of doing business. For a discussion of various laws and regulations that impact our businesses, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. The implementation of the Health Reform Legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation includes guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, establishes minimum medical loss ratios, creates a federal premium review process, imposes new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits, or EOBs) between health insurers and their members, grants to members new and additional appeal rights, imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, reduces the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduces payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Legislation have already taken effect, and other provisions become effective at various dates over the next several years. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation remain pending. Due to the complexity of the Health Reform Legislation, the impact of the Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. For example, effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation established minimum medical loss ratios for all commercial health plans in the large employer group, small employer group and individual markets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations), subject to state specific exceptions. Companies with medical loss ratios below these targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. The medical loss ratios that determine the size of the rebates will be measured by state, by group size and by licensed subsidiary. This disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed in total. Effective in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans will be required to maintain a minimum medical loss ratio of 85%, although the rules expected to set forth the basis for calculating this medical loss ratio have not yet been issued. Some state Medicaid programs are also imposing medical loss ratio requirements on Medicaid managed care organizations, which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the minimum medical loss ratios. Depending on our calculations of the medical loss ratios for each of our plans and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements, there could be meaningful disruptions in local health care markets, and our market share, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Health Reform Legislation requires the establishment of state-based health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014. The types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state, the availability of federal subsidies for premiums and cost-sharing reductions within exchanges, the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges, the operation of reinsurance, risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Health Reform Legislation also includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, scheduled to take effect in January 2014, including adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (expected to result in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements likely to result in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for some policyholders. Although HHS issued proposed regulations related to these provisions in late 2012, the federal regulations are not yet final and most states have not issued implementing regulations or guidance with respect to these provisions. Depending on the timing and outcome of the final federal regulations and required state regulations or guidance, there could be disruptions in local health care markets and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Health Reform Legislation includes a maintenance of effort (MOE) provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for adults covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state, scheduled for January 2014, and for children covered by Medicaid or CHIP, through federal fiscal year 2019. States with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. If states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under the U.S. Supreme Courts June 2012 decision, state participation in the Health Reform Legislations Medicaid expansion is voluntary. Several states have indicated they may not expand their Medicaid programs based on concerns over costs when expanded federal funding pares down, starting in 2017. The extent to which states expand their Medicaid programs, or discontinue current expansion programs, could adversely impact our Medicaid enrollment levels, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Several of the provisions in the Health Reform Legislation will likely increase our medical cost trends. Examples of these provisions are the excise tax on medical devices, annual fees on prescription drug manufacturers, enhanced coverage requirements (including essential health benefit requirements and phased-in closing of the coverage gap for Medicare Part D participants), the prohibition of pre-existing condition exclusions and the implementation of adjusted community rating requirements. The annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion to be levied on the insurance industry in 2014 increasing to $14.3 billion by 2018 with increasing annual amounts thereafter), which is not deductible for income tax purposes, and the temporary reinsurers fee ($25 billion to be levied on all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements, over a three-year period starting in 2014), will increase our operating costs. Premium increases or benefit reductions will be necessary to offset the impact these and other provisions will have on our medical and operating costs. These premium increases are often subject to state regulatory approval, and the Federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. We have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. In addition, as required under the Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a federal premium rate review process, which became effective in September 2011 and generally applies to proposed rate increases equal to or exceeding 10%. The regulations further require commercial health plans in the individual and small group markets to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting rate increases. If we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases, our margins, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that become active under the Health Reform Legislation in 2014. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets. We also expect that implementation of the Health Reform Legislation will increase the demand for products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses. We have made and will continue to make strategic decisions and investments based, in part, on these assumptions, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under the Health Reform Legislation than we expect or we are unable to attract these new individuals to our UnitedHealthcare offerings, or if the demand for our Optum businesses does not increase. Future regulatory or legislative action could further impact the implementation of Health Reform Legislation. For example, Congress may attempt to amend or withhold the funding necessary to implement the Health Reform Legislation. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the Health Reform Legislation. New federal or state laws and regulations could force us to materially change how we do business and any amendment, withholding of funding, extended delays in the issuance of necessary federal and state implementing regulations or guidance or other uncertainty regarding the Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely impact our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the legislation or cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or reverse some of the changes we have already implemented. In addition, our market share, our results of operations, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by legislative and regulatory changes. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE West contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. We also provide services to payers through our Optum businesses. These programs generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level, and general political issues and priorities. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are expected in the next few years. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these benchmark reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 470,000 of our auto-enrolled low-income subsidy members in 2012 because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or other programs on which we bid, or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the Health Reform Legislation, CMS has developed a system entitling plans that meet certain quality ratings at the local plan level to various quality bonus payments. In addition, under the Health Reform Legislation, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MME managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MME demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been audited. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. In February 2012, CMS published a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited, beginning with 2011 payments, using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples and, for Medicare Advantage plans, after considering a fee-for-service (FFS) error rate adjuster that will be used in determining the payment adjustment. Depending on the plans selected for audit, if any, and the error rate found in those audits, if any, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have been and may in the future become involved in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the OIG, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the FTC, U.S. Congressional committees, the DOJ, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC, the CVM, the IRS, the SRF, the DOL, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other things, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could expand to subjects beyond those targeted by the original investigation, audit, review, assessment or private action and could lead to government actions, which could result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for a discussion of certain of these matters. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Further, many of our businesses are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for additional information. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain our ability to manage our business model. For example, final HHS regulations released in January 2013 implementing the ARRA amendments to HIPAA may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business. In addition, HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities. Although we are not aware of HHS plans to audit any of our covered entities, an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products . We provide PBM services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices. See Item 1, Business - Government Regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our PBM businesses. Our PBM businesses would also be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to timely process and dispense prescriptions and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual recently began to transition pharmacy benefit management for approximately 12 million of its commercial members, including pharmacy claims adjudication and customer service, from Express Scripts subsidiary, Medco Health Solutions, Inc., to OptumRx. If our customers are not satisfied with our pharmacy benefit management services as a result of this transition, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual could face loss of business, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. We compete with other companies on the basis of many factors, including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives, location and choice of health care providers, quality of customer service, comprehensiveness of coverage offered, reputation for quality care, financial stability and diversity of product offerings. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil, and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, competitors include CVS Caremark Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Catamaran Corporation. Our OptumHealth and OptumInsight reportable segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. In particular markets, competitors may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. Failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations (ACOs), practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which may impact our relationships with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. For example, we are involved in litigation with out-of-network providers, as described in more detail in Litigation Matters in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. The success of certain Optum businesses, particularly Collaborative Care, depends on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. If our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or to adequately price their contracts with these third party payers, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other things, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we periodically acquire businesses or commence operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters; however, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses. Any failure by us to successfully manage our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to both AARP members and non-members. If we fail to meet the needs of AARP and its members, including by developing additional products and services, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliance with the AARP could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we continue to expand our business outside the United States, acquired foreign businesses, such as Amil, will present challenges that are different from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments that are materially different from what we have experienced in our U.S. operations. For more information on the Amil acquisition, see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation, and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to successfully manage our foreign acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and the future costs of or revenues and cash flows from our international operations, and any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our producers and consultants, who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and/or market health care products and services of our competitors. As a result, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to them regarding our product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Because producer commissions are included as administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the Health Reform Legislation, these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. In addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling these companies products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment rates have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our non-employer individual plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. All of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and/or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims, and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2012. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal and/or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our net investment income and we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. We also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can materially and adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially and adversely affected. Goodwill and other intangible assets were $36.0 billion as of December 31, 2012, representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. For example, the manner in or the extent to which the Health Reform Legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business. Similarly, the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, adversely impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with our debt covenants. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting our systems against cybersecurity risks and threats, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products, and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Dr. Bueno has agreed to hold the shares for five years from the date of sale, subject to certain exceptions. PERFORMANCE GRAPHS The following two performance graphs compare our total return to shareholders with the returns of indexes of other specified companies and the SP 500 Index. The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group), for the five-year period ended December 31, 2012 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2012 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2007 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.  Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making health care work better. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. Further information on our business is included in Item 1, Business and additional information on the our segments can be found in this Item 7 and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses relating to care management, consumer engagement and support, distribution of benefits and services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Pricing Trends . We seek to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics, cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation and premium rebates at the local market level. We endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. Changes in business mix and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. Further, we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure through continued market competition in commercial products and government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcares businesses, we expect the medical care ratio to rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the health benefit exchange market in 2014. In the commercial market segment, we expect pricing to continue to be highly competitive in 2013. We plan to hold to our pricing disciplines and, considering the competitive environment and persistently weak employment and new business formation rates, we expect continued pressure on our commercial risk-based product membership in 2013. Additionally, self-insured membership as a percent of total commercial membership is expected to continue to increase at a modest pace in 2013 and beyond, due in part to the emerging popularity of midsize employers moving to self-funded arrangements. In government programs, we are seeing continuing rate pressures, and rate changes for some Medicaid programs are slightly negative. Unlike in prior years, recent Medicaid reductions have generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or care provider fee schedule reductions by the state sponsor. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. Medicare funding is similarly pressured; see further discussion below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. We expect these factors to result in pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2013. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare created a new affordable Basic Plan for Medicare Part D consumers and reclassified its large 4 million member Medicare Part D plan to an Enhanced Plan status with CMS. The change to Enhanced Plan status changes the seasonal pattern of earnings to later in the year with no material impact expected on full year profitability. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Medical costs represent the costs of our obligations for claims and/or benefits of our risk-based insurance arrangements. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Medical Cost Trends. In 2012, we managed our commercial medical cost trend to a level under 5.5 percent. In 2013, we expect a slight increase in trend from 2012, albeit with relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2012. We expect our total trend will be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers as they try to compensate for soft utilization trends and cross-subsidization pressure due to their government reimbursement levels. Underlying utilization trends declined significantly in 2010 and increased modestly in 2011 and 2012. Use of outpatient services has been the primary driver of utilization trend increase, with inpatient utilization declining. We also experienced an increase in prescription drug costs in 2012 and expect that trend to continue due to unit cost pressure and a trend towards expensive new specialty drugs. As we move into 2013, we believe current utilization trends are slightly below what we believe to be normal utilization levels. The weak economic environment, combined with our medical cost management, has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe our alignment of progressive benefit designs, consumer engagement, clinical management, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers and network resources is favorably controlling medical and pharmacy costs, enhancing affordability and quality for our customers and members and helping to drive strong market response and growth. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses or an increase in the delivery of medical services on an integrated basis may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. Other Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other health economies. In the U.S., health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including in the U.S. enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. These factors are creating market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve the overall care for people, improve the health of a population and reduce the cost of care. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. We have seen increased participation in incentive-based payment models such as pay for performance, shared savings, bundled/episode payment and Patient-Centered Medical Home models (PCMHs). We also have seen continued development and deployment of risk-based accountable care models designed to modernize local delivery systems by better coordinating care, reducing the fragmentation of treatments between multiple care providers in the current system, limiting unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions, focusing on preventive care, breaking down reimbursement and treatment silos, and improving quality and outcomes. This trend is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Government Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs. States are struggling to balance unprecedented budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. At the same time, many are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. More and more, Medicaid managed care is being viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. Additionally, there are more than nine million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Dually eligible beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. While these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly, they have historically been in unmanaged environments. This provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid financing to fund efforts to optimize the health status of this frail population through close coordination of care. As of December 31, 2012, UnitedHealthcare served more than 250,000 members in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community  State will help implement Ohios MME program, one of the first in the country under the new CMS design. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Commercial Rate Increase Review. The Health Reform Legislation requires HHS to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and clarified that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. Premium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states as of the date of this report. The competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience a tight, competitive commercial pricing environment. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices. We anticipate requesting rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression in the commercial health benefits business. Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage pricing benchmarks have been cut over the last several years and additional cuts were implemented in 2012, with changes to continue to be phased in over the next one to five years (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, would trigger automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including a reduction in outlays for Medicare starting in March 2013, absent further Congressional action. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans will be required to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 85%. CMS has not yet issued guidance as to how this requirement will be calculated for Medicare Advantage plans. A significant portion of our network contracts are tied to Medicare reimbursement levels. However, future Medicare Advantage rates may be outpaced by underlying medical cost trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can and are making to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. The expanded stars bonus program is set to expire in 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans per PPACA (compared to current bonuses that are available to certain qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher). Approximately 60% and 10% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and 4 stars or higher, respectively for the 2014 payment year based on scoring released by CMS in October 2012. Updated scores, to be released in October 2013, will determine what portion of our Medicare Advantage membership will reside in a 4 star or 5 star plan and qualify for quality bonus payments in 2015. Although we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings, if we are unable to significantly increase the level of membership in plans with a rating of 4 stars or higher for the 2015 payment year, our 2015 results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Compared to 2011, our 2012 Medicare Advantage membership has increased by 400,000 consumers, or 18% , including acquisitions. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Industry Fees and Taxes. The Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The amount of the annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will be equal to the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated based on the ratio of an entitys net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industrys net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be paid and expensed in 2014; however, because our policies are annual, we have included the tax and other Health Reform Legislation cost factors in our 2013 rate filings relating to 2014 rate periods and any related premium increases for 2013 policies that have coverage into 2014 will increase the amount of premium recognized in 2013. Our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 as a result of the non-deductibility of these taxes. With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges in 2014, the Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs are: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program which will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements ($25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion (subject to increases based on state decisions) will fund the state reinsurance pools and $5 billion funds the U.S. Treasury). The terms of the specific reinsurance programs to be used in each state are not yet known. It is our intention to pass these taxes and fees on to customers through increases in rates and/or decreases in benefits, subject to regulatory approval. State-Based Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Effective in 2014, state-based exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in October of 2013. We expect to selectively respond and participate in exchanges as they are introduced to the market. Our level of participation in state-based exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local markets current and future prospects, including how the exchange and its rules are set up state-by-state and, our market position relative to others in the market. Our participation will likely evolve and change over time as the exchange markets mature. Exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, its pace and its impact on our established membership. For example, certain small employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and larger employers may elect to convert their benefit plans from risk-based to self-funded programs. The Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level. Individual  Small Group Market Reforms. The Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions that will take effect on January 1, 2014 and are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace. Although HHS issued proposed regulations in late 2012, these regulations are not yet final. Key provisions include: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are rated in many states and are expected to result in significant adjustments in some policyholders rates during the transition period; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders and will also impact rates; and (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs (e.g. member cost sharing requirements) and could also significantly impact rates for some policyholders.

We also plan to acquire an additional 25% of Amil in the first half of 2013. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail on Amil. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We repurchased 57 million shares for $3.1 billion and paid dividends of $0.8 billion. ##TABLE_END 2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTS C onsolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings. Medical Costs Medical costs increased in 2012 due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. Operating Costs The increases in our operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans businesses. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate. Reportable Segments We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State, and UnitedHealthcare International; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Item 1, Business for a description of how each of our reportable segments derives its revenues. Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

In fee-based commercial products, the increase was due to a number of new business awards and strong customer retention. Medicare Advantage increased due to strengthened execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth, combined with the addition of 185,000 Medicare Advantage members from 2012 acquisitions. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by a fourth quarter market withdrawal from one product in a specific region, affecting 175,000 beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth was due to strong retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, membership decreased primarily as a result of the first quarter 2012 loss of approximately 470,000 auto-assigned low-income subsidy Medicare Part D beneficiaries, due to pricing benchmarks for the government-subsidized low income Medicare Part D market coming in below our bids in a number of regions. International represents commercial membership in Brazil added as a result of the Amil acquisition in 2012. UnitedHealthcares revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates. UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. In March 2012, UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans was awarded the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. The contract, for health care operations, includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the governments option. The first year of operations is anticipated to begin April 1, 2013. The base administrative services contract is expected to generate a total of $1.4 billion in revenues over the five years. Optum. Total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes. Optums earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth. Earnings from operations for 2012 and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. OptumInsight Revenues at OptumInsight for 2012 increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management. OptumRx The decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $15.6 billion for 2012 and $16.7 billion for 2011 . OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. Over the course of 2013, we will consolidate and manage our commercial pharmacy benefit programs from Express Scripts subsidiary, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add approximately12 million members throughout 2013. 2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues for 2011 were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our UnitedHealthcare businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all Optum businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2011 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use, and a modest increase in health system utilization, mainly in outpatient and physician office settings. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 and 2010 there was $720 million and $800 million , respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. Operating Costs The increase in our operating costs for 2011 was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate for 2011 decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth for 2011 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across our businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting expected underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations for 2011 increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio, which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011, and lower favorable reserve development levels. Optum. Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx. Optums operating margin for 2011 was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optums businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Increased revenues at OptumHealth for 2011 were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. Earnings from operations for 2011 and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services. OptumInsight Increased revenues at OptumInsight for 2011 were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. OptumRx The increase in OptumRx revenues for 2011 was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion and $14.4 billion for 2011 and 2010 , respectively. OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2012, based on the 2011 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.6 billion . In 2012 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. In 2011 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.5 billion , or 107% , primarily due to increased investments in acquisitions in 2012. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for further information on 2012 acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities increased $3.0 billion primarily due to increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, partially offset by increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. The increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances were primarily related to the Amil acquisition. 2011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $695 million , or 11% , from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion , or 22% , primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million , or 55% , primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion included $8.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.1 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $19.2 billion of debt securities and $677 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $241 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2012 . Included in the debt securities balance was $1.9 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was AA as of December 31, 2012 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $1.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.3% . Bank Credit Facilities . We have $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 21 banks, which mature in November 2017 and November 2013, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2012 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012 , the annual interest rates on these facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.3% . Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 35.0% as of December 31, 2012 . We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2012 . Long-term debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In connection with the Amil acquisition, we assumed variable rate debt denominated in Brazilian Reais, Amils functional currency. The total Brazilian Real denominated long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 was $611 million , and had an aggregate weighted average interest rate of approximately 9%. For more detail on the Amil debt see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. In October 2012, we issued $2.5 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $625 million of 0.850% fixed-rate notes due October 2015 , $625 million of 1.400% fixed-rate notes due October 2017 , $625 million of 2.750% fixed-rate notes due February 2023 and $625 million of 3.950% fixed-rate notes due October 2042 . In August 2012, we completed an exchange of $1.1 billion of our zero coupon senior unsecured notes due November 2022 for $0.5 billion additional issuance of our 2.875% notes due in March 2022 , $0.1 billion additional issuance of our 4.375% notes due March 2042 and $0.1 billion in cash. The transaction was undertaken to increase financial flexibility and reduce interest expense. In March 2012 , we issued $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $600 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due March 2022 and $400 million of 4.375% fixed-rate notes due March 2042 . Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2012 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Negative  A  Stable  A-  Stable  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2012 , our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of our common stock. For details of our 2012 share repurchases, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. Dividends. In June 2012 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Since May 2011 , we had paid an annual dividend of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. For details of our dividend payments, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. Amil Tender Offer. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we purchased approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of Amil for $3.5 billion. We expect to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest during the first half of 2013 through a tender offer for Amils publicly traded shares. The tender offer price will be at the same price paid to Amils controlling shareholders, adjusted for statutory interest under Brazilian law from the date of payment to the controlling shareholders to the date of payment to the tendering minority shareholders.

See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements\" for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (g) Includes commitments to purchase the remaining publicly traded Amil shares as well as the put/call for the shares owned by Amil's remaining non-public shareholders. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements\" for more detail. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2012, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2012, our days outstanding in medical payables was 49 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $860 million , $720 million and $800 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2012 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (86 ) 0.50  (172 ) 0.75  (257 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2012 :  ##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (168 ) (2)  (337 ) (3)  (505 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2012 , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2012 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2012 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2012 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $62 million. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Effective in 2011, U.S. commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered. ##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2013. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2012 . Intangible assets. Separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 77% of our total intangible asset balance of $4.7 billion . Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2012 . Investments As of December 31, 2012 , we had investments with a carrying value of $21 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2012 , our investments had gross unrealized gains of $825 million and gross unrealized losses of $9 million . For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in our income statement. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Fair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: ##TABLE_START  the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. ##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc.) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses of $9 million and $32 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were $6 million , $12 million and $23 million , respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2012 . We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $656 million. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2012 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $86 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2012 , we had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2012, the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as A+. As of December 31, 2012 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian Real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $9.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $6.7 billion of our debt and deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2012 were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2012 , $19.1 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $13.6 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2012 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments (b)  Fair Value of Debt 2 %  $  $  $ (1,303 )  $ (2,200 )    (656 )  (1,194 ) (1)  (18 )  (14 )   1,366 (2)  nm  nm   2,747 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments (b)  Fair Value of Debt 2%  $  $  $ (1,239 )  $ (1,946 )    (622 )  (1,082 ) (1)  (12 )  (4 )   1,086 (2)  nm  nm   2,343 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2012 , some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END With the Amil acquisition, we have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian Real to the U.S. Dollar in translation of Amils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian Real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian Real. For example, as of December 31, 2012 a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real would cause a reduction in net assets of $510 million. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. We funded certain cash needs of Amil through intercompany notes. At December 31, 2012, we had currency swaps with a total notional amount of $256 million hedging the U.S. dollar to the Brazilian Real to provide a cash flow hedge on the principal amount of the intercompany notes to Amil. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $677 million of investments in equity securities, including employee savings plan related investments of $348 million and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments. ", "8": " ITEM 8.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 6, 2013 ,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (also referred to as UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and make health care work better. The Company helps individuals access quality care at an affordable cost; simplifying health care administration and delivery; strengthening the physician/patient relationship; promoting evidence-based care; and empowering physicians, health care professionals, consumers, employers and other participants in the health system with actionable data to make better, more informed decisions. Through the Companys diversified family of businesses, it leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. See Note 13 for a description of the Companys reportable segments and how the segments generate their revenues. ##TABLE_START 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies ##TABLE_END Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to United States of America (U.S.) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated intercompany balances and transactions. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to medical costs payable, premium rebates and risk-adjusted and risk-sharing provisions related to revenues,  valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other policy liabilities and other current receivables, valuations of investments, and estimates and judgments related to income taxes and contingent liabilities. These estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any changes in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from its customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Effective in 2011, U.S. commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, the Company estimates premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans is subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependants, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or mail services, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care rendered through OptumHealth. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The Company had checks outstanding of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, which were classified as Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the change in this balance has been reflected as Checks Outstanding within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The outstanding checks are all related to zero balance accounts; the Company does not net checks outstanding with deposits in other accounts. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. ##TABLE_START  For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in Investment and Other Income. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  For equity securities, the Company recognizes impairments in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the securitys cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the impairment in Investment and Other Income. ##TABLE_END New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program), and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. The Companys arrangements with AARP extend to December 31, 2017 for the AARP Program and give the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D offerings until December 31, 2014, subject to certain limited exclusions. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Companys earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the RSF and were $109 million , $99 million and $107 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see Other Policy Liabilities below. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its PBM businesses affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non- affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of Product Revenue. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Policy Liabilities or Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. Beginning in 2011, Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount of 50% on brand name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in Unearned Revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in Medical Costs and Operating Costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2012 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2013, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2012  December 31, 2011 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $  $  $   $   $  $  Other policy liabilities        ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 1, 2013, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START  The initial coverage limit increased to $2,970 from $2,930 in 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,734 as compared to $6,658 in 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The annual out-of-pocket maximum increased to $4,750 from $4,700 in 2012. ##TABLE_END The discounts on prescription drugs within the coverage gap increased to 52.5% from 50% in 2012 for brand name drugs and to 21% from 14% in 2012 for generic drugs. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company reviews property, equipment and capitalized software for events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that it might not recover their carrying value. If the Company determines that an asset may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded.  The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 7 years or length of lease term, whichever is shorter Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDGoodwill Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if the Company elects to proceed directly with quantitative testing, it will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting-unit fair value assessment and completed its annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2012 , no reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value and the Company concluded that there was no need for any impairment of its goodwill balances. Intangible assets Separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). The Companys intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives. The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible assets (or asset groups) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There were no material impairments of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program (described below), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under the Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Program are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. Changes in the RSF are reported in Medical Costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the balance in the RSF was $1.3 billion . Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $135 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.8 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $125 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.8 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. As of December 31, 2012, the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as A+. Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign operations denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the end of each accounting period. Related revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders equity and comprehensive income. Noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are primarily related to holders of Amil Participaes S.A. (Amil) shares. Amil was acquired in 2012, see Note 6 for more information. During 2012, the Company purchased noncontrolling interest shares for $319 million , of which $11 million was recorded as a reduction of Additional Paid-In Capital. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Companys net earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was nil and other noncontrolling interest activity was not material. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over three to four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in Operating Costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, any unrecognized compensation cost and any related excess tax benefit. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs  (ASU 2011-04). This update provides guidance on how fair value measurement should be applied where existing GAAP already requires or permits fair value measurements. In addition, ASU 2011-04 requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 became effective for the Companys fiscal year 2012. The adoption of the measurement guidance of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The new disclosures have been included with the Companys fair value disclosures in Note 4. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,  Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 requires entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 became effective for the Companys fiscal year 2012. The Company presented separate Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, which appear consecutive to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had or will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its investments that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). As of December 31, 2012 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. A portion of the Companys investments in equity securities and venture capital funds consists of investments held in various public and nonpublic companies concentrated in the areas of health care services and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care and related technology stocks will likewise impact the value of the Companys equity portfolio. The equity securities and venture capital funds were evaluated for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains included in Investment and Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total OTTI  $ (6 )  $ (12 )  $ (23 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       Net OTTI recognized in earnings  (6 )  (12 )  (23 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (13 )  (11 )  (6 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4. Fair Value ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, non-current prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during 2012 or 2011 . Non-financial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source, prices reported by its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The Companys Level 3 equity securities are primarily investments in venture capital securities. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries and having similar revenue and growth characteristics; and similar preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair value of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based off of recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. AARP Program-related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt and equity securities held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys debt and equity securities. Interest Rate and Currency Swaps. Fair values of the Companys swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. Long-term debt. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-related Other Liabilities. AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding AARP related assets and liabilities, which are presented in a separate table below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2012         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,615  $  $   $ 8,406 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,752     2,538 State and municipal obligations    6,667    6,667 Corporate obligations   7,185   7,209 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,238    2,238 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,765  17,444   19,226 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value $ 9,830  $ 18,252  $  $ 28,323 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate and currency swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ December 31, 2011         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 8,569  $  $   $ 9,429 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,551     2,373 State and municipal obligations    6,750   6,765 Corporate obligations   5,805   6,007 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,353    2,353 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,567  16,227   18,002 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Total assets at fair value  $ 10,469  $ 17,089  $  $ 27,975 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2012           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations       Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt  $   $ 17,034  $   $ 17,034  $ 15,167 December 31, 2011           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations       Corporate obligations       Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt  $   $ 13,149  $   $ 13,149  $ 11,638 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for accounts and other current receivables, unearned revenues, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by reportable segment, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  UnitedHealthcare  OptumHealth  OptumInsight  OptumRx  Consolidated Balance at January 1, 2011  $ 17,837  $  $ 3,308  $  $ 22,745 Acquisitions   1,353      1,454 Dispositions  (2 )    (214 )    (216 ) Adjustments, net  (4 )    (4 )    (8 ) Balance at December 31, 2011  17,932  2,113  3,090   23,975 Acquisitions  6,557      7,360 Adjustments and foreign currency effects, net  (30 )    (19 )    (49 ) Balance at December 31, 2012  $ 24,459  $ 2,818  $ 3,169  $  $ 31,286 ##TABLE_ENDIn October 2012, the Company purchased approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of Amil for approximately $3.2 billion in a private transaction. Later in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company purchased an additional 17.8 million shares of Amil for $0.3 billion , bringing the stake in Amil attributable to the Company to approximately 65% of Amils outstanding shares. Amil is a health care company located in Brazil, providing health and dental benefits, hospital and clinical services, and advanced care management resources to more than 5 million people. The total consideration paid and fair value of the noncontrolling interest exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $5.9 billion , of which $1.0 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $0.6 billion to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $4.3 billion to goodwill. To estimate the acquisition date fair value of the noncontrolling interest of $2.2 billion , the Company utilized the public share price as of the date of acquisition. Contingent liabilities were measured based on the probable amount that could be reasonably estimated. The results of operations and financial condition of Amil have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the UnitedHealthcare reportable segment since the acquisition date. The pro-forma effects of this acquisition on the Companys results of operations were not material. In conjunction with the 2012 purchases, the Company generated Brazilian tax deductible goodwill of approximately $2.7 billion . Because of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Amil, the Company is required by Brazilian law to commence a mandatory tender offer for the remaining publicly traded shares. The Company expects to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest during the first half of 2013 through this tender offer. The tender offer price will be at the same price paid to Amils controlling shareholders, adjusted for statutory interest under Brazilian law from the date of payment to the controlling shareholders to the date of payment to the tendering minority shareholders. The remaining 10% stake in Amil is held by shareholders, including Amils CEO, who has been a member of the Companys Board of Directors since October 2012, who have committed to retain the shares for at least five years. They have the right to put the shares to the Company and the Company has the right to call these shares upon expiration of the five year term, unless accelerated upon certain events, at fair market value. Related to this acquisition, Amils CEO invested approximately $470 million in unregistered UnitedHealth Group common shares in the fourth quarter of 2012 and has committed to hold those shares for the same five year term, subject to certain exceptions. Acquired net tangible assets and liabilities for Amil at acquisition date were: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Cash and cash equivalents  $ Investments  Accounts receivable and other current assets  Property, equipment and other long-term assets  1,266 Medical costs payable  Other current liabilities  Contingent liabilities  Long-term debt and other long-term liabilities  ##TABLE_ENDSince the Amil acquisition occurred in the fourth quarter, the purchase price allocation is subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible and fixed assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed, for acquisitions excluding Amil was $3.3 billion , $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion , respectively. These acquisitions were not material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2012 , the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.3% . The Company has $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility with 21 banks, which mature in November 2017 and November 2013, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2012 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable based on term and are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012 , the annual interest rates on both of the credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.3% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio not more than 50% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2012 . Interest Rate and Currency Swap Contracts In 2012, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and variable rate investment balances. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on the Companys fixed-rate debt. Since the critical terms of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they are assumed to be highly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt with no net impact recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Both the hedge fair value changes and the offsetting debt adjustments are recorded in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net fair value of these swaps was $3 million at December 31, 2012 and is recorded in Other Long-Term Assets for $14 million and Other Long-Term Liabilities for $11 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In December 2012, the Company entered into currency swap contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the principal amount of intercompany borrowings denominated in Brazilian Real. The currency swaps have a notional amount of $256 million and mature on December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of the currency swap liability was $3 million , which was recorded in Other Current Liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_START 9.

The 2010 effective income tax rates were at higher levels due to the cumulative implementation of changes under the Health Reform Legislation.  The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Accrued expenses and allowances  $  $ U.S. Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards   Share-based compensation   Long term liabilities   Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards    Unearned revenues   Unrecognized tax benefits   Domestic other   Foreign other    Subtotal  1,579  1,536 Less: valuation allowances  (271 )  (184 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,308  1,352 Deferred income tax liabilities:     U.S. Federal and State intangible assets  (1,335 )  (1,148 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets  (640 )   Capitalized software development  (482 )  (465 ) Net unrealized gains on investments  (296 )  (275 ) Depreciation and amortization  (249 )  (256 ) Prepaid expenses  (113 )  (86 ) Foreign other  (179 )   Total deferred income tax liabilities  (3,294 )  (2,230 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (1,986 )  $ (878 ) ##TABLE_ENDValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $105 million expire beginning in 2019 through 2032, state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2013 through 2032. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2012 the Company had $94 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions    Prior year tax positions    Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (48 )  (34 )   Settlements  (10 )  (25 )   Statute of limitations lapses  (14 )  (53 )  (43 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized tax benefits from the net reduction of interest and penalties accrued of $20 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010 , the Company recognized $15 million of interest expense and penalties. The Company had $23 million and $41 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2012 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, was $77 million . The Company currently files income tax returns in the U.S., various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2011 and prior. The Companys 2012 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to 2007. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Companys Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. Estimated taxes are paid monthly or quarterly with an annual return due on June 30 following the end of the taxable year. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $37 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. ##TABLE_START 10. Shareholders Equity ##TABLE_END Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2012, based on the 2011 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could have been paid by the Companys U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.6 billion . For the year ended  December 31, 2012 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2012 , $1.1 billion of the Companys $8.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents was held by non-regulated entities. The Companys regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2012 ; regulated entity statutory capital exceeded aggregate minimum capital requirements. Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2012 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2012 , the Board renewed and expanded the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company repurchased 57 million shares at an average price of $54.45 per share and an aggregate cost of $3.1 billion . As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of its common stock. Dividends In June 2012 , the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Since May 2011 , the Company had paid an annual dividend of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Companys dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date  Amount per Share  Total Amount Paid     (in millions)  $ 0.4050  $ 2011  0.6125  2012  0.8000  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 11. Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had 43 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs and up to 16 million of awards in restricted shares. As of December 31, 2012 , there were also 20 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for all employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within Long-Term Investments with an approximately equal amount in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $348 million and $281 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 12. Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_END The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates through 2028. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $334 million , $295 million and $297 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2012 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2014  2015  2016  2017  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of or for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $45 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $432 million , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims, and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters Out-of-Network Reimbursement Litigation. The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits challenging reimbursement amounts for non-network health care services based on the Companys use of a database previously maintained by Ingenix, Inc. (now known as OptumInsight), including putative class actions and multidistrict litigation brought on behalf of members of Aetna and WellPoint. These suits allege, among other things, that the database licensed to these companies by Ingenix was flawed and that Ingenix conspired with these companies to underpay their members claims and seek unspecified damages and treble damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, interest, costs and attorneys fees. The Company is vigorously defending these suits. In 2012, the Company was dismissed as a party from a similar lawsuit involving Cigna and its members. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters due to the procedural status of the cases, dispositive motions that remain pending, the absence of class certification in any of the cases, the lack of a formal demand on the Company by the plaintiffs, and the involvement of other insurance companies as defendants. California Claims Processing Matter.  On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. The matter has been the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge since December 2009. Although the Company believes that CDI has never issued a penalty in excess of $8 million , CDI is seeking a penalty of approximately $325 million in this matter. The Company is vigorously defending against the claims in this matter and believes that the penalty requested by CDI is excessive and without merit. After the administrative law judge issues a ruling at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, expected in early 2013, the California Insurance Commissioner may accept, reject or modify the administrative law judges ruling, issue his own decision, and impose a fine or penalty. The Commissioners decision is subject to challenge in court. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the novel legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory fines and penalties, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event a fine or penalty is assessed. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been and is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Brazilian securities regulator - Comisso de Valores Mobilirios (CVM), IRS, SRF, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. In February 2012, CMS announced a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology and that it will conduct RADV audits beginning with the 2011 payment year. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by care providers and may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. CMS has not communicated how the final payment adjustment under its methodology will be implemented. Government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs and could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. ##TABLE_START 13. Segment Financial Information ##TABLE_END Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International because they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes and operate in a similar regulatory environment. The U.S. businesses also share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and will serve TRICARE West Region members beginning April 1, 2013. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  State provides health plans and care programs to beneficiaries of acute and long-term care Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Special Needs Plans, Medicare-Medicaid Eligible beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare International is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. ##TABLE_END 85 ##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling consumer health management and integrated care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, integrated care delivery services, consumer relationship management and sales distribution platform services and financial services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services, and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system work with OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers a multitude of pharmacy benefit management services and programs including claims processing, retail network contracting, rebate contracting and management, clinical programs, such as step therapy, formulary management and disease/drug therapy management programs to achieve a low-cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit. OptumRx also provides patient support programs and dispensing of prescribed medications, including specialty medications, through its mail order pharmacies for its clients members. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 29% for the year ended December 31, 2012 , 28% for year ended December 31, 2011 , and 27% for the year ended December 31, 2010 , most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 99% of consolidated total revenues during 2012. Long-lived fixed assets located in the U.S. represented approximately 70% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2012. Corporate and intersegment elimination amounts are presented to reconcile the reportable segment results to the consolidated results.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2012 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2012  The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated F ramework. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting of Amil Participaes S.A and its subsidiaries (Amil). Such exclusion was in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. We acquired a controlling interest in Amil during October 2012. Amil represented 10% of our consolidated total assets and 1% of our consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2012 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 .   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2012, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Amil Participaes S.A and its subsidiaries (Amil), which was acquired during October 2012 and whose financial statements collectively constitute approximately 10% of total assets and 1% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Amil. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2012. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our reports dated February 6, 2013 expressed as an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP   Minneapolis, Minnesota February 6, 2013 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. 2014 Business Realignment On January 1, 2014, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. Our Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsights results of operations. Our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) beginning with our first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx). UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcare is advancing strategies to improve the way health care is delivered and financed, offering consumers a simpler, more affordable health care experience. Our market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  a national scale; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  innovation for customers. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as OptumRx pharmacy benefit products and services, certain OptumHealth care management and integrated care delivery services and OptumInsight health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services.

UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals, and the military, specifically TRICARE west region members. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides over 30 million Americans access to health care as of December 31, 2013 . Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or able to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependants, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. As part of the new public health care exchange market that opened October 1, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual now offers health benefit plans through exchanges in 10 states and District of Columbia, including four individual exchanges and nine small group (SHOP) exchanges. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual typically distributes its products through consultant or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group size segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and producers, including brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also distributes products through general agents, each of which is a wholesale agent or agency that contracts with a carrier to distribute individual or group benefits, providing extensive services to customers. In recent years, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has diversified its model more extensively, distributing through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third party administrators (TPAs). Direct-to-consumer sales will be supported by industry participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through state or federally led exchanges for coverage effective January 1, 2014. Additionally, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has expanded distribution to include retail offerings responsive to the needs of individual consumers. Over the last few years, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has opened several retail storefronts in various locations across the United States that provide solutions to consumers at all stages in life, from individual plans to employer coverage, as well as solutions for Medicare-Medicaid eligible (MME) individuals. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provide the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes as well as individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual emphasizes local markets and leverages its national scale to adapt products to meet specific local market needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals major product families include: Traditional Products.

For example, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals Diabetes Health Plan emphasizes health engagement for diabetics and prediabetics, with personalized health action plans, scorecards and benefits that are specifically designed to encourage consumers to participate actively in maintaining their health. During 2013, more than 45,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including nearly 270 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased an HRA or HSA product.

Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS and in some cases consumer premiums.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement had approximately 3 million people enrolled in its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2013 . Medicare Advantage plans are designed at the local level taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for that geographic area.

UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2013 , UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 4 million beneficiaries. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) provides for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. Currently, more than half of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends. The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community  State and our participation are: ##TABLE_START  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily young women and children  19 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CHIP  19 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Dual SNP  18 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD)  14 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Long-Term Care (LTC)  10 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  childless adults  programs for the uninsured  7 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services)  5 markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  administrative service offering  1 market. ##TABLE_END 5 The health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group, delivering them at the local market level to support effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are eligible for care in nursing homes and assisted living. They often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State recognizes that within these broad groups, there exist individuals whose collective physical, behavioral and social challenges are so significant that they drive an inordinate percentage of UnitedHealthcare Community  States total medical costs. In UnitedHealthcare Community  States insured Medicaid population, approximately 1% of its membership accounts for about 30% of total costs. Care providers sometimes refer to this group as super utilizers. The LTC market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTC population is made up of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTC programs and represent a subset of the more than 15 million ABD Americans. Currently, only one-quarter of the ABD population and less than 20% of the LTC eligible population are served by managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs. There are nearly 10 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. This group has historically been referred to as dually eligible. MME beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. While these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and optimize peoples health status through close coordination of care. Total annual expenditures for dually eligibles are estimated at more than $300 billion, or more than 10% of the total health care costs in the United States. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare served more than 275,000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community  State implemented a managed fee-for-service demonstration model in the state of Washington. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community  State will help implement MME programs in the states of Ohio, Washington and Michigan. These programs are among the first in the country to leverage CMS demonstrations to serve MMEs.

OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and integrated care delivery businesses. OptumHealth is organized into two major operating groups: Physician Solutions and Consumer Solutions. Physician Solutions. Physician Solutions includes the Specialty Networks and Integrated Care Delivery offerings. ##TABLE_START  Specialty Networks . Within Specialty Networks, OptumHealth serves nearly 57 million people in two primary ways: 1) creating access to networks of provider specialists in the areas of behavioral health management (e.g., mental health, substance abuse), global well-being (e.g., international work/life solutions), chronic physical health management (e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy), and complex medical conditions (e.g., transplant, infertility); and 2) managing the care and health needs for consumers through a variety of programs utilizing predictive modeling, evidence-based clinical outcomes management and peer support. Specialty Networks address areas likely to have significant variation in clinical practice, where a disciplined, evidence-based approach can drive improved health outcomes and reduced costs. These range from more commonly accessed services (e.g., behavioral health and chiropractic) to less common procedures (e.g. transplant, infertility, bariatric surgery and kidney disease/end stage renal disease). ##TABLE_END 7 ##TABLE_START  Integrated Care Delivery.

Many of OptumInsights software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements, and outsourcing contracts are performed over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2013 was $5.5 billion, of which $2.7 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $1.1 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2012 was $4.6 billion. The increase in 2013 backlog was attributable to the partnership with Dignity Health that established the Optum360 provider revenue management business. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services, the potential for cancellation, non-renewal, or early termination of service arrangements.

OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliance and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications.

OptumRxs PBM services include retail pharmacy network management services, mail order and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing, Medicare Part D services, and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services. OptumRx has a network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and two mail services facilities in California and Kansas. The mail order and specialty pharmacy fulfillment capabilities of OptumRx are an important strategic component of its business, providing patients with convenient access to maintenance medications, offering a broad range of complex drug therapies and patient management services for individuals with chronic health conditions, and enabling OptumRx to manage its clients drug costs through operating efficiencies and economies of scale. OptumRx provides PBM services to UnitedHealthcare members enrolled in benefit plans that offer pharmacy benefits.

Additionally, OptumRx managed specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcares businesses with services including patient support and clinical programs that ensure quality and value for consumers. Specialty drug management is important in managing overall drug spend, as biologicals and other specialty medications are fast growing pharmacy expenditures. OptumRx also provides PBM services to non-affiliated external clients, including public and private sector employer groups, insurance companies, Taft-Hartley Trust Funds, TPAs, managed care organizations (MCOs), Medicare-contracted plans, Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. OptumRxs distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. In the event we fail to comply with, or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses, and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations including the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business will also be subject to audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data when the programs are implemented starting in 2014. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of Health Reform Legislation. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans business, such as our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD. Certain of our businesses, such as UnitedHealthcares eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optums high acuity clinical workflow software, hearing aid products and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Optums clinical research activities are subject to laws and regulations outside of the United States that regulate clinical trials. Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust. Health Care Reform. Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation has expanded dependant coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not met, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The full impact of Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters. Privacy, Security, and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-9, the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States, will be replaced by ICD-10 code sets on October 1, 2014, and health plans and providers will be required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the DOL as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures expanding the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. The NAIC also established the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that by 2015 will require us to conduct additional group solvency assessments, maintain a risk management framework and file additional reports with state insurance regulators. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), or TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker, and sales distributions laws and regulations. Our UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states) doing business in those states, including those issuing health, long-term care, life and accident insurance policies, can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRxs mail order pharmacies must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our mail order pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our mail order pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Additionally, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. These laws, regulations and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses and operations are international in nature and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our Amil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries and regulation by Brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar (ANS), whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil, and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Caremark Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Catamaran Corporation. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, plan, project, should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, Health Reform Legislation established minimum MLRs for certain health plans and authorized HHS to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans, which could make it more difficult for us to price our products competitively. In addition, our OptumHealth Integrated Care Delivery business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to accurately predict, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2013 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2013 would have been reduced by approximately $200 million, excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations, and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims, and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty fund laws, certain health, life and accident insurance companies and, in certain cases, HMOs can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business in these states, which would expose our business to the risk of insolvency of a competitor in these states. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, FDA regulations, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, and state corporate practice of medicine doctrines and fee-splitting rules, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. Additionally, we participate in the emerging private exchange markets and it is not yet known to what extent the states will issue new regulations that apply to private exchanges. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products, and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and/or managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government, and a number of states have enhanced (or are proposing to enhance) their rate review processes. Additionally, the final market reform rules released in February 2013 require that we submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Moreover, geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently face political, economic, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction. The regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor relations, fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by U.S.-based businesses. We have acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States. For example, our acquisition of Amil subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries, which vary from comparable U.S. laws and regulations, and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are also subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation, such as the implementation of Health Reform Legislation and associated exchanges. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Due to its complexity and ongoing implementation, Health Reform Legislations impact remains difficult to predict, is not yet fully known and could adversely affect us. For example, if we do not maintain certain minimum MLRs, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers annually. Beginning in 2014, commercial MLRs will need to factor in the effect of new premium stabilization provisions (risk adjustment, risk corridor and transitional reinsurance) for individual and small group markets. These factors, along with uncertainties in how MLR rules may be amended to address other changes required by Health Reform Legislation, decrease the predictability of medical loss rebates. Some state Medicaid programs are also imposing MLR requirements on Medicaid MCOs, which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the minimum MLRs. Depending on our calculations of the MLR for each of our plans and the manner in which we adjust our business model in light of these requirements, there could be meaningful disruptions in our market share, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Several states have indicated they may not expand their Medicaid programs based on concerns over the costs of such programs when expanded federal funding is reduced starting in 2017. The extent to which states expand their Medicaid programs, or discontinue current expansion programs, could adversely impact our Medicaid enrollment levels, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Health Reform Legislation also includes a maintenance of effort (MOE) provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for adults covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state, and for children covered by Medicaid or CHIP, through the end of the 2019 federal fiscal year. States with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. If states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, Health Reform Legislation requires the establishment of state based health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers by 2014. The types of exchange participation requirements ultimately enacted by each state, the availability of federal subsidies for premiums and cost-sharing reductions within exchanges, the potential for differential imposition of state benefit mandates inside and outside the exchanges, the operation of reinsurance, risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms inside and outside the exchanges and the possibility that certain states may restrict the ability of health plans to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small employers outside of the exchanges could result in disruptions in local health care markets and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Health Reform Legislation also includes for 2014 specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. These changes may lead to significant disruptions in local health care markets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Further, while risk adjustment will apply to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets beginning in 2014, the availability of transitional relief makes the full extent of its impact difficult to predict and could further disrupt underlying exchange risk pools, impact pricing and market strategies, and result in adverse consequences to the marketplace. While we have made certain assumptions in our premium rate development relating to projected risk adjustment transfers, actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions. Premium increases or benefit reductions will be necessary to offset Health Reform Legislations impact on our medical and operating costs. These premium increases are often subject to state regulatory approval, and the federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by commercial health plans and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. If we are not able to secure approval for adequate premium increases to offset increases in our cost structure or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases, our margins, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, plans deemed to have a history of unreasonable rate increases may be prohibited from participating in the state-based exchanges that become active under Health Reform Legislation in 2014. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under Health Reform Legislation than we expect, if we are unable to attract these new individuals to our UnitedHealthcare offerings, or if the demand for Health Reform Legislation related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. We also provide services to payers through our Optum businesses. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract for the convenience of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are expected in the next few years. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. For 2014, CMS has asked plans to submit additional information indicating whether or not medical conditions were diagnosed in a clinical setting. CMS has indicated that it will publish further guidance on the treatment of risk adjustment data in early 2015, including with respect to diagnoses made during risk assessments, that may change the way in which Medicare Advantage payments are determined. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or other programs on which we bid, or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of Health Reform Legislation, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. In addition, under Health Reform Legislation, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MME managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MME demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. In February 2012, CMS published a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited, beginning with 2011 payments, using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples and, for Medicare Advantage plans, after considering a fee-for-service error rate adjuster that will be used in determining the payment adjustment. Depending on the error rate found in those audits, if any, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular, and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business. While we have prepared for the transition to ICD-10 as a HIPAA-regulated entity, if unforeseen circumstances arise, it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if some providers continue to use ICD-9 codes on claims after October 1, 2014, we will have to reject such claims, which may lead to claim resubmissions, increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction. Further, providers may use ICD-10 codes differently than they used ICD-9 codes in the past, which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment. During the transition to ICD-10, certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result, they collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows .  Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products . We provide PBM services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices. Our PBM businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements attention and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations, practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of certain businesses, including OptumHealth Integrated Care Delivery and Amil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or to adequately price their contracts with these third party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we periodically acquire businesses or commence operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we continue to expand our business outside the United States, acquired non-U.S. businesses, such as Amil, will present challenges that are different from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments that are different from those with which we are familiar in our U.S. operations. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation, and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the sales and servicing of our business. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our producers and consultants, who generally do not provide services to us exclusively, but instead typically also market health care products and services of our competitors. As a result, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education to them regarding our product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Producer commissions will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs. For example, such commissions are included as administrative expenses under MLR requirements of Health Reform Legislation and, therefore, are not included in the minimum MLR calculation. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive. These have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment rates have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our non-employer individual plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. All of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated and/or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2013. Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal and/or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our net investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. Goodwill and other intangible assets were $35.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, representing 43% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. For example, the manner in or the extent to which Health Reform Legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business. Similarly, the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. We could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents, that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a third-party. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customers data. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States such as the ANS in Brazil. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group) for the five-year period ended December 31, 2013 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2013 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2008 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid.  Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences among the companies in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy. ##TABLE_START  12/08  12/09  12/10  12/11  12/12  12/13 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 114.75  $ 137.58  $ 195.62  $ 212.42  $ 299.58 SP 500 Index 100.00  126.46  145.51  148.59  172.37  228.19 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  111.82  132.11  132.08  156.49  200.00 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Item 1, Business and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements. 2014 Business Realignment. On January 1, 2014, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. Our Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsights results of operations. Our periodic filings with the SEC beginning with our first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx). Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including enacted health care reforms in the United States, which could also impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . We seek to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, and competitive dynamics (such as product positioning and price competitiveness) and legislative and regulatory changes such as cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation. We continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcares businesses, and before giving effect to Health Reform Legislation taxes, we believe the medical care ratio will rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the emerging public health benefit exchange market. In response to Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a review threshold of annual commercial premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and enacted a new rule requiring the production of information for any proposed rate increase. HHS review does not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. We have experienced regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. The competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices and we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. We have requested and received rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We expect commercial pricing to continue to be highly competitive. The intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. Overall, the industry has experienced lower medical costs trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. Conversely, carriers are generally reflecting the 2014 Health Reform Legislation industry fees in their pricing. In some markets, competitors have adjusted their pricing to reflect recent medical cost trend experience as well as the implication of rate review rules and new benefit changes from Health Reform Legislation. In other areas we are seeing greater price competition due to pricing adjustments and other varied approaches used by competitors. The Medicare Advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years, with additional reductions to take effect in 2014 and 2015, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. We expect these factors to result in year-over-year pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare business during 2014. States are struggling to balance budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. During 2013, rate changes for some Medicaid programs were slightly negative year-over-year. In general, we expect continued pressure on net margin percentages due to the Medicaid reimbursement rate environment, which we expect will remain tight due to the potential non-collectability of the insurer fee primarily related to Medicare Dual SNP programs and Medicaid. We continue to work with our state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends, including fees and related taxes, and to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. Medical Cost Trends. We expect our 2014 commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.0% plus or minus 50 basis points, compared to approximately 5% in 2013. In 2014, we expect relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2013, before taking into account reform impacts. The impact of Health Reform Legislation and mandates is expected to pressure 2014 medical cost trends. Driving the increases are mandated essential health benefits and limits on out-of-pocket maximums. Consistent with recent years, our 2014 trend is expected to be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers. We expect 2014 pharmacy trends to be consistent with 2013. The primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty drugs. In recent years, the recent weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe the expected stability in the utilization trends in 2014 is influenced by our medical management strategies, our continued focus on value-based contracting arrangements and greater consumer engagement. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care for people, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. Through expansion of our existing programs and the creation of new programs, we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2013, more than 2 million people we serve were directly aligned through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk and bundled episode of care payment approaches. This trend is also creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Government Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector programs. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs. Many states are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. Medicaid managed care is increasingly viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. For example, there are nearly 10 million dually eligible beneficiaries who typically have complex conditions, with costs of care that are far higher than those of a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. Similarly, a small but complex group of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTC programs represent only 6% of the total Medicaid population yet account for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The long-term care market represents a portion of the more than 15 million ABD Americans. While these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly, they have primarily been historically served in unmanaged environments. These markets provide UnitedHealthcare and Optum with an opportunity to work with governments to improve the health status of these populations through coordination of care. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare served more than 275,000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In the first half of 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community  State will help implement Integrated MME program awards in three states. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Item 1, Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage payment benchmarks have been cut over the last several years, including 2013, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, triggered automatic across-the-board budget cuts (known as sequestration), including a 2% reduction in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D payments beginning April 1, 2013. The CMS final notice of 2014 Medicare Advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes significant reductions to 2014 Medicare Advantage payments, including the benchmark reductions described previously. These reductions and Health Reform Legislation insurance industry tax described below result in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 4% in 2014, against a typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3%. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. Compared to 2013, and prior to any efforts to mitigate these funding reductions, we estimate that the net impact on our 2014 consolidated after-tax earnings will be approximately $0.9 billion. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans in 2014. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be required to have minimum MLRs of 85%. We do not believe the minimum MLR standard will have a material impact on our earnings. CMS is expected to release the proposed 2015 Medicare Advantage Rates on February 21, 2014. We expect sustained Medicare Advantage rate pressures in 2015 due to the continuing effect of the factors described above. Health Reform Legislation directed HHS to establish a program to reward high-quality Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2012. Accordingly, our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on a plans star rating. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans revenue. The current expanded stars bonus program that pays bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher is set to expire after 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans. For the 2014 payment year, approximately 57% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 9% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. For the 2015 payment year, based on scoring released by CMS in October 2013, approximately 70% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 24% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we can make and are making to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase member premiums over and above the monthly payments we receive from the government, and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. The depth of the underfunding of these benefits has caused us to exit certain plans and market areas for 2014 in which we served approximately 150,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in 2013. In other markets, we may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest benefit cuts, but expect stable or growing membership in our strongest markets. We are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings to improve the performance and sustainability of our local market programs for 2016 and beyond. In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries increasing the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Industry Fees and Taxes. Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The industry-wide amount of the annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated to each market participant based on the ratio of the entitys net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industrys net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be expensed ratably throughout 2014 and our first payment will be made in September 2014. With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014, Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompass: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements, $25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion, subject to increases based on state decisions, will fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion will fund the U.S. Treasury (Reinsurance Program). While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only non-grandfathered, market reform compliant individual business will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. We expect our share of the industry fee to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2014. We estimate a significant increase of approximately 500 basis points in our 2014 effective income tax rate because this fee is not deductible. We estimate that the 2014 effect on earnings from operations due to our tax deductible contributions to the Reinsurance Program will be approximately $0.5 billion in 2014, payable in 2015. We do not expect material payments or receipts related to the temporary risk corridors program, permanent risk adjustment program or reinsurance recoveries in 2014. Our 2014 results of operations will include estimates related to these fees and programs. To the extent possible, we include the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing, which is expected to result in $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of additional premium in 2014. Since the industry fee will be included in operating costs, we expect our medical care ratio to decrease in 2014 compared to historical results; the industry fee cost will be factored in, however, when calculating minimum MLR rebates. Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Across markets, we and our competitors are adapting product, network and marketing strategies to anticipate new distribution or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges, private exchanges and off exchange purchasing. Effective in 2014, states may create their own public exchange, enter a partnership exchange or rely on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers, with enrollment processes that commenced in October 2013. Exchanges create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, the pace of migration in the market and the impact of the migration on our established membership. For example, over time certain employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and some employers purchasing full risk products could convert to self-funded programs. Our level of participation in public exchanges has been and will continue to be determined on a state-by-state basis. Each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities, our current local presence, our competitive positioning, our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and members and the regulatory environment. In 2014, we are participating in 13 exchanges in 10 states and the District of Columbia, including four individual and nine SHOP exchanges. Health Reform Legislation and related U.S. Supreme Court ruling also provide for optional expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level, with varying levels of state adoption planned for January 1, 2014. We participate in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and of these, more than half have opted to expand Medicaid. Individual  Small Group Market Reforms. Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions, for most individual and small group plans with plan years beginning on January 1, 2014, that are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace, including, among other matters: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are priced in many states; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders; (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs in the individual market, such as member cost sharing requirements; and (4) guaranteed issue requirements, which will require carriers to provide coverage to any qualified group or individual. These changes have resulted in significant benefit design and pricing changes for a substantial portion of the fully insured individual and small group markets. In 2014, we expect a decrease in individual membership due to a reduction in the number of states in which we will offer policies to new customers.

Medicare Part D stand-alone membership grew by 725,000 people. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx completed the insourcing of pharmacy services for 12 million new and migrating customers served by UnitedHealthcare. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The consolidated medical care ratio of 81.5% increased 110 basis points. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  As of December 31, 2013, there was $1.0 billion of cash available for general corporate use and 2013 cash flows from operations were $7.0 billion . ##TABLE_END 34 2013 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2012 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues during 2013 were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions, including Amil, growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of Optums major businesses. The revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in Medicare Advantage rates. Also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fully-insured commercial customer from a risk-based to a fee-based arrangement affecting 1.1 million members. While this conversion reduced our full-year 2013 consolidated revenues by $2.3 billion, the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs during 2013 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above. The year-over-year medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for Medicare Advantage products, changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs, and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $680 million , compared to $860 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating Costs The increase in our operating costs during 2013 was due to business growth, including an increase in fee-based benefits and fee-based service revenues and a greater mix of international business, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts.

The number of individuals in commercial fee-based arrangements increased due to this conversion as well as new business awards and strong customer retention. On April 1, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans began service under the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. This administrative services contract for health care operations added 2.9 million people and includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the governments option. Medicare Advantage participation increased due to solid execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by the first quarter 2013 divestiture of our Medicaid business in South Carolina and a fourth quarter 2012 market withdrawal from one product in Wisconsin, which combined affected 235,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention in the market. International represents commercial customers in Brazil added in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Amil acquisition, and subsequent organic growth. UnitedHealthcares revenue growth in 2013 was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served. The effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above. UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development. Optum Total revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to broad-based growth across Optums services portfolio with growth in each of Optums major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare commercial customers and external clients. Optums earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting progress on Optums plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increases at OptumHealth in 2013 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery, and organic growth. Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business, including local care delivery, population health and wellness solutions, and health-related financial services offerings. OptumInsight Revenues at OptumInsight in 2013 increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 reflected increased revenues, changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency. OptumRx The increase in OptumRx revenues in 2013 were due to the insourcing of UnitedHealthcares commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both UnitedHealthcares Medicare Part D members and external clients. Over the course of 2013, we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the OptumRx platform from a third party. Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, pricing disciplines, and greater use of generic medications. 2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTS C onsolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings. Medical Costs Medical costs increased in 2012 due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. Operating Costs The increases in operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans businesses. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates. UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio that was driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. Optum. Total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes. Optums earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth. Earnings from operations for 2012 and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. OptumInsight Revenues at OptumInsight for 2012 increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management. OptumRx The decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2013, based on the 2012 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.3 billion . In 2013 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $430 million of extraordinary dividends. This level of dividends maintained our target consolidated risk-based capital level. In 2012 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares (the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of Amil during the second quarter of 2013 for $1.5 billion); (b) a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and long-term debt, as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt (in 2012, the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt primarily related to the Amil acquisition); and (c) increased net purchases of investments. 2012 Cash Flows Compared to 2011 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased due to increased net income and related tax accruals, which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year in which rebate payments were made under Health Reform Legislation. Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) increased investments in acquisitions in 2012; (b) increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, primarily related to the Amil acquisition; (c) increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Medicare Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion included $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.0 billion was available for general corporate use), $19.4 billion of debt securities and $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $311 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.5 years. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.6 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2013 . Included in the debt securities balance was $1.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was AA as of December 31, 2013 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a $4.0 billion commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2% . Bank Credit Facilities . We have $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in November 2018 and November 2014 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2013 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2013 , the annual interest rates on both bank credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.2% . Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 34.4% as of December 31, 2013 . We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2013 . Long-term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In February 2013, we issued $2.25 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $250 million of floating-rate notes due August 2014, $500 million of 1.625% fixed-rate notes due March 2019, $750 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due March 2023 and $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate notes due March 2043. In March and April of 2013, we redeemed all of our outstanding subsidiary variable rate debt for $619 million. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2013 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Stable  A  Positive  A-  Stable  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize our capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2013, our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 83 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2013 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2012 , we had paid an annual cash dividend of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Amil Tender Offer. We acquired all of Amils remaining public shares for $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2013, bringing our ownership in Amil to 90%. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2013, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2015 to 2016  2017 to 2018  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 2,644  $ 3,450  $ 3,411  $ 18,147  $ 27,652 Operating leases      2,403 Purchase obligations (b)       Future policy benefits (c)     1,940  2,601 Unrecognized tax benefits (d)         Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e)      1,482  1,711 Other obligations (f)      Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g)       1,175 Total contractual obligations  $ 3,851  $ 4,996  $ 5,276  $ 22,203  $ 36,326 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. For variable rate debt, the rates in effect at December 31, 2013 were used to calculate the interest coupon payments. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END 41 ##TABLE_START (c) Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, they have been classified as due Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (g) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries, primarily the shares owned by Amils remaining non-public shareholders. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2013, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2013, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2013, 2012, and 2011 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $680 million , $860 million and $720 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2013:  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (96 ) 0.50  (192 ) 0.75  (287 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2013:  ##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (191 ) (2)  (382 ) (3)  (573 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2013, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2013; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2013 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2013 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $65 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Additionally, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be subject to a minimum MLR threshold of 85%. We will include in our estimates of premiums to be recognized the expected premium minimum MLR rebates, if any. U.S. commercial health plans with MLRs on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. ##TABLE_END 44 Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2014. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). These intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 73% of our total intangible asset balance of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2013. Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rates, perpetuity growth rates and discount rates. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2013. Investments As of December 31, 2013, we had investments with a carrying value of $21.5 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2013, our available-for-sale investments had gross unrealized gains of $326 million and gross unrealized losses of $234 million . For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, and recognized in net earnings, and all other causes, and recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Fair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: ##TABLE_START  prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, our custodian, our investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. ##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. The unrealized losses of $234 million and $9 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $8 million , $6 million and $12 million , respectively. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2013. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk a 1% increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $756 million . Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2013 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $89 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2013 , we had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A+. As of December 31, 2013 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $8.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $9.6 billion of our commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2013 were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2013 , $18.5 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.2 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2013 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2013 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments (b)  Fair Value of Debt 2 %  $  $  $ (1,474 )  $ (1,786 )    (756 )  (974 ) (1)  (52 )  (17 )   1,167 (2)  nm  nm  1,224  2,505 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2012 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Investments (b)  Fair Value of Debt 2 %  $  $  $ (1,303 )  $ (2,200 )    (656 )  (1,194 ) (1)  (18 )  (14 )   1,366 (2)  nm  nm   2,747 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2013 , a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $490 million. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies.

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) ##TABLE_ENDReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2014 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  ##TABLE_START  / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2014

to the Consolidated Financial Statements UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through the Companys diversified family of businesses, it leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to medical costs payable, revenues,  valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other policy liabilities and other current receivables, valuations of certain investments, and estimates and judgments related to income taxes and contingent liabilities. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any changes in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from its customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, and beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans is subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependants, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or mail services, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care rendered through OptumHealth. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The Company had checks outstanding of $1.3 billion as of both December 31, 2013 and 2012 , which were classified as Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the change in this balance has been reflected within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The outstanding checks are primarily related to zero balance accounts; the Company does not net checks outstanding with deposits in other accounts. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. ##TABLE_START  For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in Investment and Other Income. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. ##TABLE_END 58 ##TABLE_START  For equity securities, the Company recognizes impairments in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the securitys cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the impairment in Investment and Other Income. ##TABLE_END New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program), and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. The Companys arrangements with AARP extend to December 31, 2020 for the AARP Program and give the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D offerings until December 31, 2020, subject to certain limited exclusions. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Companys earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the RSF and were $101 million , $109 million and $99 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see Other Policy Liabilities below. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of whom provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its PBM businesses affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of Product Revenue. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Policy Liabilities or Other Current Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount on brand name prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Accordingly, amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in Unearned Revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as Customer Funds Administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in Medical Costs and Operating Costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2013 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2014, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2013  December 31, 2012 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $  $  $   $  $  $  Other policy liabilities         ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 1, 2014, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D individual coverage levels by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START   The initial coverage limit decreased to $2,850 from $2,970 in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,455 as compared to $6,734 in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   The annual out-of-pocket maximum decreased to $4,550 from $4,750 in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The discount on prescription drugs within the coverage gap of 52.5% is consistent with 2013 for brand name drugs and increased to 28% from 21% in 2013 for generic drugs. ##TABLE_END Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 7 years or length of lease term, whichever is shorter Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDGoodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. As of December 31, 2013 , no reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value and the Company concluded that there was no need for any impairment of goodwill. Intangible assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There were no material impairments of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2013 . Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program (described below), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Program are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF; losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. Changes in the RSF are reported in Medical Costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the balance in the RSF was $1.3 billion . Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $136 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.7 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $135 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.8 billion was recorded in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. As of December 31, 2013 , the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as A+. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are primarily related to non-public shareholders of Amil. During 2013, the Company increased its ownership of Amil to 90% . For the year ended December 31, 2013, redeemable noncontrolling interests were reduced by $946 million primarily due to the acquisition of all of Amils remaining public shares for $1.4 billion , with an additional $57 million recorded as a reduction to Additional Paid in Capital, partially offset by 2013 acquisitions that included redeemable noncontrolling interests of $471 million . At Amils acquisition date in 2012 , the Company purchased approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of Amil for $3.2 billion , and recorded a noncontrolling interest of $2.2 billion . Subsequently in 2012 , the Company purchased an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of Amil for $319 million . Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably; primarily over three to four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in Operating Costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, (collectively, common stock equivalents) using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, any unrecognized compensation cost and any related excess tax benefit. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Updated (ASU) No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02). ASU 2013-02 requires companies to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income, by component, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements and is intended to help entities improve the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. ASU 2013-02 became effective for the Company's fiscal year 2013 and the new disclosures have been included with the Companys investment disclosures in Note 3. ASU No. 2011-06, Other Expenses (Topic 720): Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2011-06) addresses the recognition and classification of an entity's share of the annual health insurance industry assessment (the industry fee) mandated by Health Reform Legislation. The industry fee is levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The amount of the industry fee for each health insurer is based on a ratio of the insurers net health insurance premiums written for the previous calendar year compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total net premiums. In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2011-06 on January 1, 2014, the liability for the industry fee payable in 2014 will be estimated and recorded in full within the Companys 2014 financial statements, with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation over the calendar year that it is payable. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. The Companys investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, private equity funds, and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total OTTI  $ (8 )  $ (6 )  $ (12 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       Net OTTI recognized in earnings  (8 )  (6 )  (12 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (9 )  (13 )  (11 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains (included in Investment and Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)    Income tax effect (included in Provision for Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)  (66 )  (57 )  (41 ) Realized gains, net of taxes  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4. Fair Value ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, non-current prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012 . Non-financial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , or 2011 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries and having similar revenue and growth characteristics; and similar preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based off of recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. AARP Program-related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt and equity securities held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys debt and equity securities. Interest Rate and Currency Swaps. Fair values of the Companys swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. Long-term Debt. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-related Other Liabilities. AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding AARP Program-related assets and liabilities, which are presented in a separate table below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2013         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,005  $  $   $ 7,276 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,750     2,195 State and municipal obligations    6,977    6,977 Corporate obligations   7,274   7,335 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,218    2,218 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,775  17,610   19,427 Equity securities - available-for-sale  1,291    1,572 Total assets at fair value $ 10,071  $ 17,893  $  $ 28,275 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ December 31, 2012         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,615  $  $   $ 8,406 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,752     2,538 State and municipal obligations    6,667    6,667 Corporate obligations   7,185   7,209 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,238    2,238 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,765  17,444   19,226 Equity securities - available-for-sale     Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value  $ 9,830  $ 18,252  $  $ 28,323 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate and currency swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2013           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 16,602  $   $ 16,602  $ 15,745 December 31, 2012           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations       Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt  $   $ 17,034  $   $ 17,034  $ 15,167 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

During 2013, the Company acquired all of Amils remaining public shares for $1.5 billion , bringing the Companys ownership of Amil to 90% . The remaining stake in Amil is held by shareholders, including Amils CEO, who has been a member of the Companys Board of Directors since October 2012, who have committed to retain the shares for at least five years, through October 2017. These shareholders have the right to put the shares to the Company and the Company has the right to call these shares upon expiration of the five year term, unless accelerated upon certain events, at fair market value. Related to this acquisition, Amils CEO invested approximately $470 million in unregistered UnitedHealth Group common shares in the fourth quarter of 2012 and has committed to hold those shares for the same five year term, subject to certain exceptions. The total consideration paid and fair value of the noncontrolling interest exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $6.0 billion , of which $0.7 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $0.7 billion to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $4.6 billion to goodwill. In conjunction with the Amil share purchases, the Company generated Brazilian tax deductible goodwill of approximately R$8.9 billion ( $3.8 billion in U.S. dollars at December 31, 2013). For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed, for acquisitions other than Amil was $0.4 billion , $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion , respectively. These acquisitions were not material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    $ 1,969  1,086  1,140  1,266  1,116 Thereafter  10,283 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2013 , the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2% . The Company has $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in November 2018 and November 2014 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2013 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable based on term and are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2013 , the annual interest rates on both bank credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.2% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2013 . Interest Rate Swap Contracts The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and variable rate investment balances. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on the Companys fixed-rate debt. Since the critical terms of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they are assumed to be highly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt with no net impact recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the location and fair value of the interest rate swap fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet: ##TABLE_START Type of Fair Value Hedge  Notional Amount  Fair Value  Balance Sheet Location   (in billions)  (in millions)   December 31, 2013       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 6.2  $  Other liabilities December 31, 2012       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 2.8  $  Other assets      Other liabilities ##TABLE_ENDThe following table provides a summary of the effect of changes in fair value of fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Hedge - interest rate swap (loss) gain recognized in interest expense  $ (166 )  $  $ Hedged item - long-term debt gain (loss) recognized in interest expense   (3 )  (190 ) Net impact on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations  $   $   $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 9. Income Taxes ##TABLE_END The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 3,004  $ 2,638  $ 2,608 State and local    Total current provision  3,241  2,788  2,758 Deferred provision    Total provision for income taxes  $ 3,242  $ 3,096  $ 2,817 ##TABLE_ENDThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 3,120  35.0 %  $ 3,018  35.0 %  $ 2,785  35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.4   1.7   1.7 Settlement of state exams, net of federal benefit        (29 )  (0.4 ) Tax-exempt investment income  (53 )  (0.6 )  (59 )  (0.7 )  (63 )  (0.8 ) Non-deductible compensation   0.5   0.2   0.1 Other, net   0.1  (30 )  (0.3 )  (22 )  (0.2 ) Provision for income taxes  $ 3,242  36.4 %  $ 3,096  35.9 %  $ 2,817  35.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe higher effective income tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily resulted from the favorable resolution of various one-time tax matters in 2012.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Accrued expenses and allowances  $  $ U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards   Share-based compensation   Long-term liabilities   Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards   Unearned revenues   Unrecognized tax benefits   Other-domestic   Other-non-U.S.   Subtotal  1,425  1,579 Less: valuation allowances  (207 )  (271 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,218  1,308 Deferred income tax liabilities:     U.S. federal and state intangible assets  (1,207 )  (1,335 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets  (453 )  (640 ) Capitalized software  (481 )  (482 ) Net unrealized gains on investments  (31 )  (296 ) Depreciation and amortization  (268 )  (249 ) Prepaid expenses  (137 )  (113 ) Other-non-U.S.  (7 )  (179 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities  (2,584 )  (3,294 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (1,366 )  $ (1,986 ) ##TABLE_ENDValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $111 million expire beginning in 2021 through 2033, state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2014 through 2033. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $359 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions    Prior year tax positions    Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions    (48 )  (34 ) Settlements    (10 )  (25 ) Statute of limitations lapses  (5 )  (14 )  (53 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2013, the Company recognized $4 million of interest expense. The Company recognized tax benefits from the net reduction of interest and penalties accrued of $20 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company had $27 million and $23 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, was $89 million . The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2012 and prior. The Companys 2013 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to 2008. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Companys Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. Estimated taxes are paid monthly in Brazil with an annual return due on June 30 following the end of the taxable year. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $33 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. ##TABLE_START 10. Shareholders Equity ##TABLE_END Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2013, based on the 2012 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could have been paid by the Companys U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.3 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $430 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2013, $1.0 billion of the Companys $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents was available for general corporate use. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2013, the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2013, the Board renewed and expanded the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , the Company repurchased 48 million shares at an average price of $65.52 per share and an aggregate cost of $3.2 billion . As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 83 million shares of its common stock. Dividends In June 2013 , the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2012 , the Company had paid an annual cash dividend of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Companys dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date  Amount per Share  Total Amount Paid     (in millions)  $ 1.0525  $ 1,056  0.8000  2011  0.6125  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 11. Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares). As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had 35 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs and 14 million of awards in restricted shares. As of December 31, 2013 , there were also 17 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within Long-Term Investments with an approximately equal amount in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $441 million and $348 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. ##TABLE_START 12. Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_END The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates through 2028. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $438 million , $334 million and $295 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2013, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2015  2016  2017  2018  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of or for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $39 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $499 million , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims, and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters California Claims Processing Matter.  On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. Although the Company believes that CDI has never issued a penalty in excess of $8 million , CDI has advocated a penalty of approximately $325 million in this matter. The matter was the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge beginning in December 2009, and in August 2013, the administrative law judge issued a non-binding proposed decision recommending a penalty in an amount that is not material to the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The matter is now before the California Insurance Commissioner, who has indicated that he will not adopt the administrative law judges proposed decision and will issue his own decision. The Commissioners decision is subject to challenge in court. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory fines and penalties, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event a fine or penalty is assessed. Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada Litigation. In April 2013, a Las Vegas jury awarded $24 million in compensatory damages and $500 million in punitive damages against a Company health plan and its parent corporation on the theory that they were negligent in their credentialing and monitoring of an in-network endoscopy center owned and operated by independent physicians who were subsequently linked by regulators to an outbreak of hepatitis C. In September 2013, the trial court reduced the overall award to $366 million following post-trial motions, and in December 2013, the Company filed a notice of appeal. Company plans are party to 41 additional individual lawsuits and two class actions relating to the outbreak. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters given the likelihood of reversal on appeal, the availability of statutory and other limits on damages, the novel legal theories being advanced by the plaintiffs, the various postures of the remaining cases, the availability in many cases of federal defenses under Medicare law and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the pendency of certain relevant legal questions before the Nevada Supreme Court. The Company is vigorously defending these lawsuits. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been, or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the IRS, the SRF, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. In February 2012, CMS announced a final Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit and payment adjustment methodology and that it will conduct RADV audits beginning with the 2011 payment year. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by care providers and may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. CMS has not communicated how the final payment adjustment under its methodology will be implemented. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits and reviews in which it is currently involved given the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. ##TABLE_START 13. Segment Financial Information ##TABLE_END Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare International because they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes and operate in a similar regulatory environment. The U.S. businesses also share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program (West Region). UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program, and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare International is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling consumer health management and integrated care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health ##TABLE_END 82 management services, integrated care delivery services, consumer engagement and relationship management and sales distribution platform services and financial services. ##TABLE_START  OptumInsight is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services, and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system use OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy benefit management services and programs including retail pharmacy network management services, mail order and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing, and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 29% , 29% , and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 95% and 99% of consolidated total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Substantially all revenue was U.S. generated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 72% and 70% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The non-US revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare International. 2014 Business Realignment On January 1, 2014, the Company realigned certain of its businesses to respond to changes in the markets it serves and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. The Companys Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsights results of operations. The Companys periodic filings with the SEC beginning with the first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx). Corporate and intersegment elimination amounts are presented to reconcile the reportable segment results to the consolidated results.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2013. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2013 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2013, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2013. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated  February 12, 2014  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2014 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers, students and other individuals and serves the nations active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program.

UnitedHealthcare Global (formerly UnitedHealthcare International) includes Amil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance across eight business markets: local care delivery, care management, consumer engagement, distribution services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2014, we managed over $165 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  national scale; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END 1 ##TABLE_START  innovation for customers and consumers. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as OptumRx pharmacy benefit products and services, certain OptumHealth care management and local care delivery services and OptumInsight health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include a total of over 850,000 physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,100 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under Government Regulation and in Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals and military service members in the TRICARE west region. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides nearly 29 million Americans access to health care as of December 31, 2014 . Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. In recent years, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has diversified its model more extensively, distributing through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual launched UnitedHealthcare Marketplace, a new shopping platform for employers seeking to offer their employees flexibility and a choice of UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is also participating in select multi-plan exchanges that they believe are structured to encourage consumer choice. Direct-to-consumer sales are also supported by participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through exchanges. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual participated in 13 state public health care exchanges, including four individual and nine small group exchanges. In 2015, we are participating in 23 individual and 12 small group state public exchanges. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provide the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes, as well as individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has seen increased demand for consumer driven health plans and new network approaches with lower costs, as well as more convenient care options for consumers. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual emphasizes local markets and leverages its national scale to adapt products to meet specific local market needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs).  The market for health benefit products is shifting, with benefit and network offerings shaped, at least in part, by the requirements and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation), employer focus on quality and employee engagement, and the urgent need to align the system around value. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals major product families include: Traditional Products. Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options from managed plans, such as Choice and Options PPO, to more traditional indemnity products. The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products and Tools. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs and consumer education. During 2014, more than 32,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including more than 300 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased HRA or HSA products from us. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals consumer engagement tools support members with access to benefit, cost and quality information through online and mobile applications, such as Advocate4Me, myHealthcare Cost Estimator and Health4Me. Using innovative tools and technology, UnitedHealthcare and Optums applications are helping people address a broad range of health related issues, including benefits and claims questions, finding the right doctor, proactive support for appointments and issue resolution, health education, clinical program enrollment and treatment decision support. Value Based Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals suite of consumer incentive products increases individual awareness of personal health and care quality and cost for heightened consumer responsibility and behavior change. These products include: Small Business Wellness, which is a packaged wellness and incentives product that offers gym reimbursement and encourages completion of important wellness activities. For mid-sized clients, SimplyEngaged is a scalable activity-based reward program that ties incentives to completion of health improvement activities, while SimplyEngaged Plus provides richer incentives for achieving health goals. For large, self-funded customers, the UnitedHealthcare Healthy Rewards program offers a flexible incentive design to help employers choose the right activities and include appropriate biometric outcomes that best fit the needs of their employee population. UnitedHealth Personal Rewards leverages a tailored approach to incentives by combining personalized scorecards with financial incentives for improving biometric scores, compliance with key health treatments and preventive care. Essential Benefits Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals portfolio of lower cost products provides value to consumers through innovative plan designs and unique network programs like UnitedHealth Premium  , which guide people to physicians recognized for providing high-quality, cost-efficient care to their patients. This approach to essential benefits is designed to deliver sustainable health care costs for employers, enabling them to continue to offer their employees coverage at more affordable prices. For example, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals tiered benefit plans offer enhanced benefits in the form of greater coinsurance coverage and/or lower copays for people using UnitedHealth Premium  designated care providers. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefits management programs, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options. All UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual members are provided access to clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, improving health and decreasing medical expenses. Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts and individuals), and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals clinical programs include: ##TABLE_START  wellness programs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  decision support; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  utilization management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  case and disease management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complex condition management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots; ##TABLE_END 3 ##TABLE_START  incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mental health/substance use disorder management; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employee assistance programs. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes, and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. Specialty Offerings . UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also delivers dental, vision, life, and disability product offerings through an integrated approach including a network of more than 58,000 vision professionals in private and retail settings, and nearly 75,000 dental offices.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers a spectrum of risk-based Medicare products that may be purchased by individuals or on a group basis, including Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Supplement products that extend and enhance traditional fee-for-service coverage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS, including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS and in some cases consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender, and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement had approximately 3 million people enrolled in its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2014 . Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. Starting in 2012, and phased in through 2017, the Medicare Advantage rate structure and quality rating bonuses are changing significantly. See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers innovative care management, disease management and other clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through its continuum of Medicare Advantage products. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to reach out to those members and create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers two stand-alone Medicare Part D plans: the AARP MedicareRx Preferred and the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus plans.

As of December 31, 2014 , UnitedHealthcare enrolled approximately 8 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including more than 5 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans and approximately 3 million in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.

These products cover the various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State UnitedHealthcare Community  State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2014 , UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 5 million beneficiaries. Health Reform Legislation provided for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. For 2015, 13 of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid, an increase of one state since 2014. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends. The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community  State and our participation are: ##TABLE_START  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children  21 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CHIP  21 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD)  16 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  SNP  14 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medicaid Expansion  13 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS)  12 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services)  6 markets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  childless adults programs for the uninsured  4 markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MMP  1 market. ##TABLE_END These health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. They often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care. The LTSS market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTSS population is made up of over 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTSS programs who represent a subset of the more than 16 million ABD Americans. Currently, only one-quarter of the ABD population and approximately 20% of the LTSS eligible population are served by managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs. There are more than 9 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. This group has historically been referred to as dually eligible or MMP. MMP beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. While these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and improve peoples health status through close coordination of care. Total annual expenditures for MMPs are estimated at more than $390 billion, or approximately 13% of the total health care costs in the United States. As of December 31, 2014 , UnitedHealthcare served more than 315,000 people with complex conditions similar to those in an MMP population in legacy programs through Medicare Advantage dual SNPs. As of December 31, 2014 , UnitedHealthcare Community  State had been awarded new MMP business taking effect in 2015 in Ohio and Texas.

OptumHealth works to optimize the care delivery system through the creation of high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health management and by focusing on caring for the most medically complex patients. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, and on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed fee per individual served.

The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2014 , was $8.6 billion, of which $4.8 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $2.9 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2013, adjusted for the January 1, 2014 business realignment discussed in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements, was $7.5 billion including $2.7 billion related to intersegment agreements. The increase in 2014 backlog was attributable to a revenue management services acquisition and general business growth, partially offset by services performed on existing contracts. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements.  OptumInsights products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications. OptumInsight provides capabilities targeted to the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospitals), payers, governments and life sciences organizations. Care Providers. Serving four out of five U.S. hospitals and tens of thousands of physician practices, OptumInsight provides capabilities that help drive financial performance, meet compliance requirements and deliver health intelligence. OptumInsights offerings in clinical workflow software, revenue management tools and services, health IT and analytics help hospitals and physician practices improve patient outcomes, strengthen financial performance and meet quality measurement and compliance requirements, as well as transition to new collaborative and value based business models. Payers. OptumInsight serves approximately 300 health plans by helping them improve operational and administrative efficiency, meet clinical performance and compliance goals, develop strong provider networks, manage risk and drive growth. OptumInsight also helps payer clients adapt to new market models, including health insurance exchanges, consumer driven health care and engagement, pay-for-value contracting and population health management. Governments. OptumInsight provides services to government agencies across 36 states and the District of Columbia. Services include financial management and program integrity services, policy and compliance consulting, data and analytics technology, systems integration and expertise to improve medical quality, access and costs. Life Sciences. OptumInsights Life Sciences business provides services to more than 200 global life sciences organizations. OptumInsights services use real-world evidence to support market access and positioning of products, provide insights into patient reported outcomes and optimize and manage risk. OptumRx OptumRx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services to more than 30 million Americans nationwide, managing more than $40 billion in pharmaceutical spending annually and processing nearly 600 million adjusted retail, home delivery and specialty drug prescriptions annually. OptumRxs PBM services deliver a low cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit through retail network contracting services, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and management and a variety of clinical programs such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease and drug therapy management programs. As of December 31, 2014, OptumRxs network included more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and two home delivery pharmacy facilities in California and Kansas. The home delivery and specialty pharmacy fulfillment capabilities of OptumRx are an important strategic component of its business, providing patients with convenient access to maintenance medications, offering a broad range of complex drug therapies and patient management services for individuals with chronic health conditions and enabling OptumRx to help consumers achieve optimal health, while maximizing cost savings. OptumRx provides PBM services to a substantial majority of UnitedHealthcare members. Additionally, OptumRx manages specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcares businesses with services including patient support and clinical programs designed to ensure quality and deliver value for consumers. This is crucial in managing overall drug spend, as biologics and other specialty medications are the fastest growing pharmacy expenditures. OptumRx also provides PBM services to non-affiliated external clients, including public and private sector employer groups, insurance companies, Taft-Hartley Trust Funds, TPAs, managed care organizations (MCOs), Medicare-contracted plans, Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. OptumRxs distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses, and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans business, such as our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD. Certain of our businesses, such as UnitedHealthcares eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optums high acuity clinical workflow software, hearing aid products and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust. Health Care Reform. Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation expanded dependent coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not satisfied, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, introduced new risk sharing programs, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The full impact of Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters. Privacy, Security, and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-9, the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States is anticipated to be replaced by ICD-10 code sets on October 1, 2015, and health plans and providers will be required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third-party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. In 2014, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that requires us to maintain a risk management framework and file a self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. The first report will be filed with Connecticut, our lead regulator, in 2015, and annually thereafter. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), TPA, or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Assessments are generally based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRxs home delivery pharmacies must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our home delivery pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As our home delivery pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our Amil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and to insurance industries and regulation by Brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies, and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Anthem, Inc., Cigna Corporation, Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil, and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Caremark Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Catamaran Corporation. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, plan, project, should or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, Health Reform Legislation established minimum MLRs for certain health plans and authorized HHS to maintain an annual price increase review process for commercial health plans, which could make it more difficult for us to increase the prices of our products. In addition, our OptumHealth Local Care Delivery business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2014 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2014 would have been reduced by approximately $190 million, excluding any offsetting impact from premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove too low, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations, and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims, and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities to the risk of paying a portion of an insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, FDA regulations, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, banking regulations, distributor and producer licensing requirements, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, fee-splitting rules, health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products, and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Some of our businesses operate internationally and consequently face political, economic, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction. The regulatory environments and associated requirements and uncertainties regarding tax, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor relations, fraud and corruption present compliance requirements and uncertainties for us that are different from those faced by U.S.-based businesses. We have acquired and may in the future acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, which may subject us to foreign and U.S.-based laws specific to the products and services we acquire or develop outside of the United States. For example, our Amil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and insurance industries, which vary from comparable U.S. laws and regulations, and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are also subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation, such as Health Reform Legislation and associated exchanges. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Due to its complexity, ongoing implementation and continued legal challenges, Health Reform Legislations full impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us. For example, Health Reform Legislation includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. In addition, if we do not maintain certain minimum loss ratios, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers. These changes can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Health Reform Legislation required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers and requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits and includes guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations. While risk adjustment applies to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets, actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions. Our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, pending legal challenges to the availability of tax subsidies to participants in federal exchange marketplaces could significantly disrupt the health insurance market and negatively affect our business. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if fewer individuals gain coverage under Health Reform Legislation than we expect, if we are unable to attract these new individuals to our UnitedHealthcare offerings, or if the demand for Health Reform Legislation related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract for the convenience of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. For 2014, CMS asked plans to submit additional information indicating whether or not medical conditions were diagnosed in a clinical setting. CMS has indicated that it will publish further guidance on the treatment of risk adjustment data in early 2015. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of Health Reform Legislation, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Beginning in 2015, plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, under Health Reform Legislation, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MMP managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MMP demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. In February 2012, CMS published a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited, beginning with 2011 payments, using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples and, for Medicare Advantage plans, after considering a fee-for-service error rate adjuster that will be used in determining the payment adjustment. Depending on the error rate found in those audits, if any, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular, and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. While we have prepared for the transition to ICD-10 as a HIPAA-regulated entity, if unforeseen circumstances arise, it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if some providers continue to use ICD-9 codes on claims after October 1, 2015, we will have to reject such claims, which may lead to claim resubmissions, increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction. Further, providers may use ICD-10 codes differently than they used ICD-9 codes in the past, which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment. During the transition to ICD-10, certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the PBM industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products . We provide PBM services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business as a home delivery pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices. Our PBM businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our PBM businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. The DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our PBM businesses even where our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our PBM businesses in connection with services for which our PBM businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, Brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, new direct to consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, health care usage, and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements attention and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which are companies that aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of certain businesses, including OptumHealth Local Care Delivery and Amil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation, and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans and our non-employer individual plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2014 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our net investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2014 , goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $36.6 billion , representing 42% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents, that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third-parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the U.S. due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customers data. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and credit ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group) for the five-year period ended December 31, 2014 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2014 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2009 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences among the companies in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy. ##TABLE_START  12/09  12/10  12/11  12/12  12/13  12/14 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 119.89  $ 170.47  $ 185.11  $ 261.07  $ 356.25 SP 500 Index 100.00  115.06  117.49  136.30  180.44  205.14 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  118.15  118.12  139.95  178.88  188.42 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the U.S., health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including enacted health reform legislation in the United States, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the new risk adjustment, risk corridor and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. We will continue to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. Overall, we continue to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates. The intensity of commercial pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. Health plans have generally reflected the Industry Tax and Reinsurance Programs (together, ACA Fees) in their pricing. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. Having reflected the additional cost step-ups in 2014 related to the ACA Fees, we anticipate health plans pricing returning to a more normal inflation rate in 2015. Annual commercial premium rate increases are subject to federal and state review and approval procedures. While our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practice, we have experienced regulatory challenges to proposed premium rate increases in certain states, including California and New York. The Medicare Advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years, with additional reductions to take effect in 2015, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. We are taking actions to respond to these funding reductions, but the reductions adversely affected after-tax earnings for our Medicare business during 2014, and we expect our 2015 Medicare MLR to be slightly higher than in 2014. We expect continued Medicaid revenue increases due to anticipated growth in our offerings; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends are primarily related to unit costs, utilization and prescription drug costs. Consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2014 cost trends were largely driven by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers. Although the weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends in recent years, the impacts of Health Reform Legislation, namely mandated essential health benefits and limits on out-of-pocket maximums, are exerting upward pressure on medical cost trends. The primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty medications, including new hepatitis C therapies. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. Delivery system modernization and payment reform are critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2014, we served nearly 3 million people through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care payment approaches. As of December 31, 2014, our contracts with value based spending total nearly $37 billion annually, up significantly from recent years. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items. For additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017 as a result of (a) changes to CMS Medicare Advantage benchmark rates; (b) Health Reform Legislation; and (c) the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reduced Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D payments (Sequestration). The CMS final notice of 2015 Medicare Advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes additional significant reductions for 2015. These industry level reductions, including the impact of the Industry Tax described below, resulted in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 6% of revenue in 2014 and more than an additional 3% in 2015, against a typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3%. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and expectation of earnings for our Medicare Advantage plans for 2015. Health Reform Legislation directed HHS to establish a program to reward high-quality Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2012. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans star ratings. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans membership and revenue. The historical expanded star bonus program, which paid bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher expired after 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will be paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. For the 2015 star bonus payment year, more than 37% of our Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars or higher. We currently expect a similar percentage of members to be enrolled in such plans for the 2016 payment year. We are dedicating substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance for the 2017 and 2018 payment years. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase member premiums over the monthly payments we receive from the government, and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. For 2015, we have added premiums in certain markets; one-third of our members that had previously purchased $0 premium products will be impacted. We may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest premiums additions, but we expect overall growth in Medicare Advantage membership in 2015. In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. Health Reform Legislation includes an Industry Tax levied proportionally across the health insurance industry for risk-based products, which began January 1, 2014. The industry-wide amount of the annual tax was $8 billion in 2014 and increases to $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. In 2015, we expect that our share of the Industry Tax will be $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2014. With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014, Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompass: a Reinsurance Program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The Reinsurance Program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements. The total three year amount of $25 billion for the Reinsurance Program will be allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the U.S. Treasury. While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. For detail on the Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Across markets, we and our competitors are adapting product, network and marketing strategies to anticipate new or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges, private exchanges and off exchange purchasing. Effective in 2014, states have either created their own public exchange, entered a partnership exchange or relied on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers. The exchanges have created new market dynamics that have impacted and could further impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market. In 2014, commercial fully insured membership expanded industry-wide with more than 7 million consumers served through the individual public exchanges alone. Self-insured enrollment remained relatively stable, but there has been an increased interest in post-reform alternatives such as private exchange solutions. Our level of participation in public exchanges is determined on a state-by-state basis. Each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities, our current local presence, our competitive positioning, our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and consumers, and the regulatory environment. In 2014, we participated in 13 state public exchanges, including four individual and nine small group exchanges. In 2015, we are participating in 23 individual exchanges and in 12 small group exchanges. Health Reform Legislation also provided for optional expanded Medicaid coverage that became effective in January 2014. We participate in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and of these, 12 states opted to expand Medicaid for 2014. For 2015, 13 of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that due to Medicaid expansion, a total of 13 million people will have obtained coverage through Medicaid by the end of 2016, and we are actively seeking to build market share serving the needs of these Medicaid expansion beneficiaries and their state sponsors.

Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs during the year ended  December 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. To the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the ACA Fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. This decrease from ACA fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Operating Cost Ratio The increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended  December 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of ACA Fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains. Income Tax Rate The increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible Industry Tax. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs in the Executive Overview above for more information on the Industry Tax and ACA Fees.

The decrease in number of people served under commercial fee-based arrangements was primarily attributable to the loss of a large state employer account. Medicare Advantage participation increased slightly year-over-year despite the significant funding reductions, which caused us to exit certain markets in January 2014, reduce product offerings, adjust networks and reduce benefits for 2014. Approximately 60% of the Medicaid growth was driven by Medicaid expansion under the ACA with the remaining growth resulting from the combination of states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in those traditional programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. The number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to price increases in Brazil in response to the increasing costs of mandated health care benefits. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention. UnitedHealthcares revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover ACA Fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. These increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of Medicare Advantage funding. UnitedHealthcares operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by ACA Fees, Medicare Advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis C and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups. Optum Total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at OptumRx and growth at OptumHealth. The increases in Optums earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in local care delivery and subacute care services. Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities. OptumInsight Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended  December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth. OptumRx Increased OptumRx revenue for the year ended  December 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in UnitedHealthcares public and senior markets, the insourcing of UnitedHealthcares commercial pharmacy benefit programs, which was completed on January 1, 2014, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues. Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended  December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs, and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment. 2013 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2012 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues during 2013 were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions, including Amil, growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of Optums major businesses. The revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in Medicare Advantage rates. Also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fully-insured commercial customer from a risk-based to a fee-based arrangement affecting 1.1 million members. While this conversion reduced our full-year 2013 consolidated revenues by $2.3 billion, the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs during 2013 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above. The year-over-year medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for Medicare Advantage products, changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs, and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Operating Costs The increase in our operating costs during 2013 was due to business growth, including an increase in fee-based benefits and fee-based service revenues and a greater mix of international business, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth in 2013 was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served. The effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above. UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development. Optum Total revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to broad-based growth across Optums services portfolio with growth in each of Optums major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare commercial customers and external clients. Optums earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting progress on Optums plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increases at OptumHealth in 2013 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery, and organic growth. Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business, including local care delivery, population health and wellness solutions, and health-related financial services offerings. OptumInsight Revenues at OptumInsight in 2013 increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers. The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 reflected increased revenues, changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency. OptumRx The increase in OptumRx revenues in 2013 were due to the insourcing of UnitedHealthcares commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both UnitedHealthcares Medicare Part D members and external clients. Over the course of 2013, we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the OptumRx platform from a third-party. Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, pricing disciplines, and greater use of generic medications. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In 2014, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in Part D subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock. 2013 Cash Flows Compared to 2012 Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased due to the net effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including: (a) an increase in pharmacy rebates receivables stemming from the increased membership at OptumRx, the effects of which were partially offset by (b) increases in medical costs payable due to the growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets and international businesses. Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares (the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of Amil during the second quarter of 2013 for $1.5 billion); (b) a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and long-term debt, as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt (in 2012, the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt primarily related to the Amil acquisition); and (c) increased net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2014 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $27.6 billion included $7.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $738 million was available for general corporate use), $18.6 billion of debt securities and $1.5 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $384 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair values of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2014 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 34.9% as of December 31, 2014 . Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In December 2014, we issued $2.0 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $750 million of 1.4% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2017, $500 million of 2.3% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2019 and $750 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2021. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Stable  A+  Stable  A-  Stable  bbb+  Positive Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. In June 2014, our Board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 71 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Dividends. In June 2014 , our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.50 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements.

However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2014, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entitys insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies can adopt the new standard using either the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance. We have determined that there have been no other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2014, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $420 million , $680 million and $860 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2014:  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (105 ) 0.50  (209 ) 0.75  (313 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical Cost PMPM Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2014:  ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (212 ) (2)  (423 ) (3)  (635 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2014, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2014; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2014 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2014 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $67 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. U.S. commercial health plans with MLRs on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business - Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2015. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). These intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 71% of our total intangible asset balance of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rates, perpetuity growth rates and discount rates. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2014. Investments As of December 31, 2014, we had investments with a carrying value of $20.6 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2014, our available-for-sale investments had gross unrealized gains of $423 million and gross unrealized losses of $66 million . For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, and recognized in net earnings, and all other causes, and recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize unrealized losses in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the loss in net earnings. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Fair Values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: ##TABLE_START  prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, our custodian, our investment consultant and third-party investment advisors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. ##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. Our unrealized losses of $66 million and $234 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $26 million , $8 million and $6 million , respectively. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2014. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk a 1% increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $683 million . Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2014 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $97 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A+. As of December 31, 2014, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2014 , we had $9.4 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2014 , $12.6 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2014 , $17.2 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $7.7 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets(b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 %  $  $  $ (1,364 )  $ (1,846 )    (683 )  (1,014 ) (1)  (54 )  (21 )   1,242 (2)  nm  nm   2,770            December 31, 2013 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets(b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2%  $  $  $ (1,474 )  $ (1,786 )    (756 )  (974 ) (1)  (52 )  (17 )   1,167 (2)  nm  nm  1,224  2,505 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2014 , a hypothetical 10% and 20% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $430 million and $790 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2014 , we had $1.5 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks, and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  ##TABLE_START  / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 10, 2015

##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. On January 1, 2014, the Company realigned certain of its businesses to respond to changes in the markets it serves and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. The Companys Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, are now included in OptumInsights results of operations. The Companys reportable segments remain the same and prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2014 presentation. See Note 13 for segment financial information. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other policy liabilities and other current receivables, valuations of certain investments, and estimates and judgments related to income taxes and contingent liabilities. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Companys customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, and beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care rendered through OptumHealth. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. ##TABLE_START  For debt securities, if the Company intends either to sell or determines that it will be more likely than not be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in investment and other income. If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it determines that it will not be more likely than not be required to sell the security but it does not expect to recover the ##TABLE_END 56 entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. ##TABLE_START  For equity securities, the Company recognizes unrealized losses in other comprehensive income if it expects to hold the security until fair value increases to at least the securitys cost basis and it expects that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If the Company intends to sell the equity security or if it believes that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in a reasonably forecasted period, the Company recognizes the loss in investment and other income. ##TABLE_END New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program), and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. The Companys arrangements with AARP extend to December 31, 2020 for the AARP Program and give the Company an exclusive right to use the AARP brand on the Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D offerings until December 31, 2020, subject to certain limited exclusions. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. Interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF. Accordingly, they are not included in the Companys earnings. Interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to the RSF and were $86 million , $101 million and $109 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see Other Policy Liabilities below. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys PBM businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its PBM businesses affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The PBM businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms. The PBM businesses record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other policy liabilities or other current receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount on brand name prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Accordingly, amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium, and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in unearned revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in medical costs and operating costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2014 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2015, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014  December 31, 2013 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $ 1,801  $  $  $  $  $  Other policy liabilities          ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 1, 2015, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D individual coverage levels by CMS, including: ##TABLE_START   The initial coverage limit increased to $2,960 from $2,850 in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   The catastrophic coverage begins at $6,680 as compared to $6,455 in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   The annual out-of-pocket maximum increased to $4,700 from $4,550 in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The discount on prescription drugs within the coverage gap increased to 55% from 52.5% in 2014 for brand name drugs and increased to 35% from 28% in 2014 for generic drugs. ##TABLE_END Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 7 years or length of lease term, whichever is shorter Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDGoodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. As of December 31, 2014 , no reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value and the Company concluded that there was no need for any impairment of goodwill. Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There were no material impairments of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 . Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities The Company had checks outstanding of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion issued from zero balance accounts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which were classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the change in this balance has been reflected within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included accrued payroll liabilities of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively. Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program (described below), health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Program are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF; losses would be borne by the Company. Deficits may be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. Changes in the RSF are reported in medical costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance in the RSF was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $127 million was recorded in Other Current Receivables and $1.7 billion was recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable, of which $136 million was recorded in other current receivables and $1.7 billion was recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. As of December 31, 2014 , the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as A+. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are primarily related to non-public shareholders of Amil. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period  $1,175  $2,121 Net earnings    Acquisitions   Redemptions    (1,417 ) Distributions  (40 )   Fair value and other adjustments   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period  $1,388  $1,175 ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2013, the Company increased its ownership of Amil to 90% by acquiring all of Amils remaining publicly-traded shares. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably; primarily over three to four years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, (collectively, common stock equivalents) using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, any unrecognized compensation cost and any related excess tax benefit. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Industry Tax Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products that began on January 1, 2014. The Company estimates its liability for the Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Companys applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method of allocation over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2014, the Company paid its 2014 Industry Tax liability of $1.3 billion . Premium Stabilization Programs Since the beginning of 2014, Health Reform Legislation has included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). The risk-adjustment provisions of Health Reform Legislation are permanent regulations and apply to market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets. Under the program, each covered member is assigned a risk score based upon demographic information and applicable diagnostic codes from the current year paid claims, in order to determine an average risk score for each plan in a particular state and market risk pool. Generally, a plan with a risk score that is less than the states average risk score will pay into the pool, while a plan with a risk score that is greater than the states average will receive money from the pool. The risk corridors provisions of Health Reform Legislation will be in place for three years and are intended to limit the gains and losses of individual and small group qualified health plans. Plans are required to calculate the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) risk corridor ratio of allowable costs (defined as medical claims plus quality improvement costs adjusted for the impact of reinsurance recoveries and the risk adjustment program) to the defined target amount (defined as actual premiums less defined allowable administrative costs inclusive of taxes and profits). Qualified health plans with ratios below 97% are required to make payments to HHS, while plans with ratios greater than 103% expect to receive funds from HHS. The Reinsurance Program is a temporary three year program that is funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements. Only issuers of market reform compliant individual plans are eligible for reinsurance recoveries from the risk pools. None of the Premium Stabilization Programs had a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements in 2014. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entitys insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies can adopt the new standard either using the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). As of December 31, 2014 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The Companys investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, venture capital funds, and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total OTTI  $ (26 )  $ (8 )  $ (6 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       Net OTTI recognized in earnings  (26 )  (8 )  (6 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (47 )  (9 )  (13 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains (included in investment and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)    Income tax effect (included in provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)  (77 )  (66 )  (57 ) Realized gains, net of taxes  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4. Fair Value ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during 2014 or 2013 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries that also have similar revenue and growth characteristics and preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based on recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Other Assets. The fair values of the Companys other assets are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-Related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt and equity securities. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-Related Other Liabilities. AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding AARP Program-related assets and liabilities, which are presented in a separate table below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2014         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,472  $  $   $ 7,495 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,427     1,620 State and municipal obligations    6,668    6,668 Corporate obligations   7,257   7,327 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,056    2,056 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,429  17,048   18,551 Equity securities - available-for-sale  1,200    1,522 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value $ 10,101  $ 17,145  $  $ 27,630 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ December 31, 2013         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,005  $  $   $ 7,276 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,750     2,195 State and municipal obligations    6,977    6,977 Corporate obligations   7,274   7,335 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,218    2,218 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,775  17,610   19,427 Equity securities - available-for-sale  1,291    1,572 Total assets at fair value  $ 10,071  $ 17,893  $  $ 28,275 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2014           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Other assets  $   $  $   $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 18,863  $   $ 18,863  $ 17,085 December 31, 2013           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 16,602  $   $ 16,602  $ 15,745 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Medical Costs Payable ##TABLE_END The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Medical costs payable, beginning of period  $ 11,575  $ 11,004  $ 9,799 Acquisitions      1,029 Reported medical costs:       Current year  93,677  89,970  81,086 Prior years  (420 )  (680 )  (860 ) Total reported medical costs  93,257  89,290  80,226 Claim payments:       Payments for current year  (82,374 )  (78,989 )  (71,832 ) Payments for prior year  (10,418 )  (9,730 )  (8,218 ) Total claim payments  (92,792 )  (88,719 )  (80,050 ) Medical costs payable, end of period  $ 12,040  $ 11,575  $ 11,004 ##TABLE_ENDFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the favorable medical cost reserve development was due to a number of individual factors that were not material . The net favorable development for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels. In 2012, reserves were also impacted by increased efficiency in claims processing and handling. 8. Commercial Paper and Long-Term Debt Commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014  December 31, 2013 (in millions, except percentages)  Par Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Par Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Commercial paper  $  $  $  $ 1,115  $ 1,115  $ 1,115 4.750% notes due February 2014          5.000% notes due August 2014          Floating-rate notes due August 2014          4.875% notes due March 2015 (a)       0.850% notes due October 2015 (a)       5.375% notes due March 2016 (a)       1.875% notes due November 2016 (a)       5.360% notes due November 2016       6.000% notes due June 2017 (a)       1.400% notes due October 2017 (a)       6.000% notes due November 2017 (a)       1.400% notes due December 2017 (a)          6.000% notes due February 2018 (a)  1,100  1,106  1,238  1,100  1,116  1,271 1.625% notes due March 2019 (a)       2.300% notes due December 2019 (a)          3.875% notes due October 2020 (a)       4.700% notes due February 2021 (a)       3.375% notes due November 2021 (a)       2.875% notes due December 2021 (a)          2.875% notes due March 2022 (a)  1,100  1,042  1,104  1,100   1,046 0.000% notes due November 2022       2.750% notes due February 2023 (a)       2.875% notes due March 2023 (a)       5.800% notes due March 2036    1,052    6.500% notes due June 2037       6.625% notes due November 2037       6.875% notes due February 2038  1,100  1,085  1,544  1,100  1,084  1,370 5.700% notes due October 2040       5.950% notes due February 2041       4.625% notes due November 2041       4.375% notes due March 2042       3.950% notes due October 2042       4.250% notes due March 2043       Total commercial paper and long-term debt  $ 17,347  $ 17,256  $ 19,034  $ 16,952  $ 16,739  $ 17,596 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Fixed-rate debt instruments hedged with interest rate swap contracts. See below for more information on the Companys interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END The Companys long-term debt obligations also included $150 million and $121 million of other financing obligations, of which $34 million were current as of both December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 . Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    $ 1,396  1,121  1,980  1,103  1,027 Thereafter  10,870 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2014 , the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.4% . The Company has $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in November 2019 and November 2015 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2014 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable based on term and are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2014 , the annual interest rates on the bank credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.2% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2014 . Interest Rate Swap Contracts The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its variable rate financial assets. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on the Companys fixed-rate debt. Since the critical terms of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they are considered to be highly effective hedges and all changes in the fair values of the swaps are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the related debt with no net impact recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the location and fair value of the interest rate swap fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet: ##TABLE_START Type of Fair Value Hedge  Notional Amount  Fair Value  Balance Sheet Location   (in billions)  (in millions)   December 31, 2014       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 10.7  $  Other assets      Other liabilities December 31, 2013       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 6.2  $  Other liabilities ##TABLE_ENDThe following table provides a summary of the effect of changes in fair value of fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Hedge - interest rate swap gain (loss) recognized in interest expense  $  $ (166 )  $ Hedged item - long-term debt (loss) gain recognized in interest expense  (170 )   (3 ) Net impact on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations  $   $   $  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 9. Income Taxes ##TABLE_END The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended  December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 3,883  $ 3,004  $ 2,638 State and local    Total current provision  4,154  3,241  2,788 Deferred provision  (117 )   Total provision for income taxes  $ 4,037  $ 3,242  $ 3,096 ##TABLE_ENDThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 3,380  35.0 %  $ 3,120  35.0 %  $ 3,018  35.0 % Industry tax   4.8         State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.6   1.4   1.7 Tax-exempt investment income  (49 )  (0.5 )  (53 )  (0.6 )  (59 )  (0.7 ) Non-deductible compensation   1.0   0.5   0.2 Other, net  (13 )  (0.1 )   0.1  (28 )  (0.3 ) Provision for income taxes  $ 4,037  41.8 %  $ 3,242  36.4 %  $ 3,096  35.9 % ##TABLE_ENDThe higher tax rate for 2014 is mostly due to the nondeductibility of the Industry Tax. The higher effective income tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily resulted from the favorable resolution of various one-time tax matters in 2012. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Accrued expenses and allowances  $  $ U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards   Share-based compensation   Long-term liabilities   Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards   Unearned revenues   Unrecognized tax benefits   Other-domestic   Other-non-U.S.   Subtotal  1,530  1,425 Less: valuation allowances  (119 )  (207 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,411  1,218 Deferred income tax liabilities:     U.S. federal and state intangible assets  (1,275 )  (1,207 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets  (496 )  (453 ) Capitalized software  (506 )  (481 ) Net unrealized gains on investments  (129 )  (31 ) Depreciation and amortization  (272 )  (268 ) Prepaid expenses  (140 )  (137 ) Other-non-U.S.  (102 )  (7 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities  (2,920 )  (2,584 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (1,509 )  $ (1,366 ) ##TABLE_ENDValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $129 million expire beginning in 2021 through 2034; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2015 through 2034. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $391 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions     Prior year tax positions    Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions      (48 ) Settlements      (10 ) Statute of limitations lapses  (1 )  (5 )  (14 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized $6 million and $4 million of interest expense, respectively. The Company recognized tax benefits from the net reduction of interest and penalties accrued of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company had $33 million and $27 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, was $92 million . The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2013 and prior. The Companys 2014 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2007 tax year. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Companys Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. Estimated taxes are paid monthly in Brazil with an annual return due on June 30 following the end of the taxable year. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $39 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. ##TABLE_START 10. Shareholders' Equity ##TABLE_END Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion , including $1.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $430 million of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2014, $738 million of the Companys $7.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents was available for general corporate use. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2014, the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2014, the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. During 2014, the Company repurchased 49 million shares at an average price of $82.57 per share and an aggregate cost of $4.0 billion . Dividends In June 2014 , the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.50 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2013 , the Company had paid an annual cash dividend of $1.12 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Companys 2014 dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date  Amount per Share  Total Amount Paid     (in millions)  $ 1.4050  $ 1,362  1.0525  1,056  0.8000  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 11. Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares). As of December 31, 2014, the Company had 25 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under its share-based compensation plan, including, but not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs and awards for 11 million restricted shares. As of December 31, 2014, there were also 14 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options and SARs Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value  (in millions)    (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period  $     Granted      Exercised (15 )      Forfeited (1 )      Outstanding at end of period   5.3  $ 1,569 Exercisable at end of period   3.1  1,085 Vested and expected to vest, end of period   5.3  1,544 ##TABLE_ENDRestricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period   $ Granted   Vested  (6 )  Nonvested at end of period   ##TABLE_ENDOther Share-Based Compensation Data ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts)  For the Years Ended December 31,    Stock Options and SARs       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share  $  $  $ Total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised    Restricted Shares       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share    Total fair value of restricted shares vested  $  $  $ Employee Stock Purchase Plan       Number of shares purchased    Share-Based Compensation Items       Share-based compensation expense, before tax  $  $  $ Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects    Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (in millions, except years)  December 31, 2014 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards  $ Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense  1.3 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and SARs were as follows: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31,     Risk-free interest rate  1.7% - 1.8%  1.0% - 1.6%  0.7% - 0.9% Expected volatility  24.1% - 39.6%  41.0% - 43.0%  43.2% - 44.0% Expected dividend yield  1.6% - 1.9%  1.4% - 1.6%  1.2% - 1.7% Forfeiture rate  5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years  5.4  5.3  5.3 - 5.6 ##TABLE_ENDRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2014, 2013, and 2012.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $496 million and $441 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. ##TABLE_START 12. Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_END The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $449 million , $438 million and $334 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2014, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2016  2017  2018  2019  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of or for December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $33 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.2 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims, and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters California Claims Processing Matter.  On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. Although the Company believes that CDI had never before issued a fine in excess of $8 million , CDI advocated a fine of approximately $325 million in this matter. The matter was the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge beginning in December 2009, and in August 2013, the administrative law judge issued a nonbinding proposed decision recommending a fine of $11.5 million . The California Insurance Commissioner rejected the administrative law judges recommendation and on June 9, 2014, issued his own decision imposing a fine of approximately $174 million . On July 10, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit in California state court challenging the Commissioners decision. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the wide range of possible outcomes, the legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting a regulatory fine in the event of a remand, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review that remain available to the Company. Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada Litigation. In April 2013, a Las Vegas jury awarded $24 million in compensatory damages and $500 million in punitive damages against a Company health plan and its parent corporation on the theory that they were negligent in their credentialing and monitoring of an in-network endoscopy center owned and operated by independent physicians who were subsequently linked by regulators to an outbreak of hepatitis C. The trial court reduced the overall award to $366 million . In 2014, the Company settled this and all other pending suits brought by individuals allegedly infected by hepatitis C for an amount that is not material to the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Although the Company remains party to two class actions brought on behalf of uninfected patients of the endoscopy center seeking the cost of medical monitoring, the Company does not believe these matters are material to its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Internal Revenue Service, the SRF, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. In February 2012, CMS announced a final Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit and payment adjustment methodology and that it will conduct RADV audits beginning with the 2011 payment year. These audits involve a review of medical records maintained by care providers and may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans. CMS has not communicated how the final payment adjustment under its methodology will be implemented. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits and reviews in which it is currently involved given the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation and petitioned a state court for approval to liquidate Penn Treaty. In 2012, the court denied the liquidation petition and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to submit a rehabilitation plan. The court recently set a hearing for July 2015 to consider the latest proposed rehabilitation plan. If the current proposed rehabilitation plan, which contemplates the partial liquidation of Penn Treaty, is approved by the court, the Companys insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treatys policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. The Company intends to vigorously challenge the proposed rehabilitation plan. The Company is currently unable to estimate losses or ranges of losses because the Company cannot predict whether, when or to what extent Penn Treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent, the amount of the insolvency, if any, the amount and timing of any associated guaranty fund assessments or the availability and amount of any premium tax and other potential offsets. ##TABLE_START 13. Segment Financial Information ##TABLE_END Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information presented to the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global because they have similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes and operate in a similar regulatory environment. The U.S. businesses also share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program (West Region). UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program, and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling consumer health management and local care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, local care delivery services, consumer engagement and relationship management and sales distribution platform services and financial services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services, and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government ##TABLE_END 80 agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system use OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. ##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy benefit management services and programs including retail pharmacy network management services, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing, and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 29% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 95% , 95% , and 99% of consolidated total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 73% and 72% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global. 2014 Business Realignment On January 1, 2014, the Company realigned certain of its businesses to respond to changes in the markets it serves and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. The Companys Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, are now included in OptumInsights results of operations. The Companys historical segment results have been restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx). Prior period reportable segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2014 presentation. The following table presents the reportable segment financial information: ##TABLE_START     Optum     (in millions)  UnitedHealthcare  OptumHealth  OptumInsight  OptumRx  Optum Eliminations  Optum  Corporate and Eliminations  Consolidated                 Revenues - external customers:                 Premiums  $ 112,645  $ 2,657  $   $   $   $ 2,657  $   $ 115,302 Services  6,516  1,300  2,224     3,635    10,151 Products     4,125    4,239    4,242 Total revenues - external customers  119,164  3,975  2,320  4,236    10,531    129,695 Total revenues - intersegment    6,913  2,906  27,740  (489 )  37,070  (37,070 )   Investment and other income            Total revenues  $ 119,798  $ 11,032  $ 5,227  $ 31,976  $ (489 )  $ 47,746  $ (37,070 )  $ 130,474 Earnings from operations  $ 6,992  $ 1,090  $ 1,002  $ 1,190  $   $ 3,282  $   $ 10,274 Interest expense              (618 )  (618 ) Earnings before income taxes  $ 6,992  $ 1,090  $ 1,002  $ 1,190  $   $ 3,282  $ (618 )  $ 9,656 Total assets  $ 62,405  $ 11,148  $ 8,112  $ 5,474  $   $ 24,734  $ (757 )  $ 86,382 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software           1,525 Depreciation and amortization           1,478                 Revenues - external customers:                 Premiums  $ 107,024  $ 2,533  $   $   $   $ 2,533  $   $ 109,557 Services  6,076   2,006     2,921    8,997 Products     3,071    3,182    3,190 Total revenues - external customers  113,108  3,371  2,098  3,167    8,636    121,744 Total revenues - intersegment    6,357  2,615  20,839  (458 )  29,353  (29,353 )   Investment and other income            Total revenues  $ 113,725  $ 9,855  $ 4,714  $ 24,006  $ (458 )  $ 38,117  $ (29,353 )  $ 122,489 Earnings from operations  $ 7,132  $  $  $  $   $ 2,491  $   $ 9,623 Interest expense              (708 )  (708 ) Earnings before income taxes  $ 7,132  $  $  $  $   $ 2,491  $ (708 )  $ 8,915 Total assets  $ 61,942  $ 9,244  $ 6,880  $ 4,483  $   $ 20,607  $ (667 )  $ 81,882 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software           1,307 Depreciation and amortization           1,375                 Revenues - external customers:                 Premiums  $ 97,985  $ 1,743  $   $   $   $ 1,743  $   $ 99,728 Services  4,780   1,807     2,657    7,437 Products     2,664    2,772    2,773 Total revenues - external customers  102,766  2,531  1,894  2,747    7,172    109,938 Total revenues - intersegment    5,503  2,363  15,611  (364 )  23,113  (23,113 )   Investment and other income            Total revenues  $ 103,332  $ 8,147  $ 4,257  $ 18,359  $ (364 )  $ 30,399  $ (23,113 )  $ 110,618 Earnings from operations  $ 7,687  $  $  $  $   $ 1,567  $   $ 9,254 Interest expense              (632 )  (632 ) Earnings before income taxes  $ 7,687  $  $  $  $   $ 1,567  $ (632 )  $ 8,622 Total assets  $ 62,971  $ 8,198  $ 6,367  $ 3,434  $   $ 17,999  $ (85 )  $ 80,885 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software           1,070 Depreciation and amortization           1,309 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 14.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2014. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2014 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2014. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. The terms we, our, us, its, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and other individuals and serves the nations active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community  State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global includes Amil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance across eight business markets: care delivery, care management, pharmacy care services, consumer engagement, distribution, health financial services, health care information technology and operational services and support. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2015, we processed one half trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed nearly $200 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcares market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  a national scale; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END 1 ##TABLE_START  innovation for customers and consumers. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optums capabilities to help coordinate patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler consumer experienc e. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1 million  physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,000 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under Government Regulation and in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals and military service members in the TRICARE west region. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides access to medical services for approximately 30 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners. This includes more than 190,000 employer customers across all 50 states. Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also offers a variety of insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals UnitedHealth Premium  program is the longest-running physician quality and efficiency designation program in the industry, making it easier for consumers to access high-quality, cost-efficient care. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has relationships with network care providers that integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs, and enable us to jointly better manage health care across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Marketplace is a shopping platform for employers seeking to offer their employees flexibility and a choice of UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is also participating in select multi-plan exchanges that are structured to encourage consumer choice. Direct-to-consumer sales are also supported by participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through exchanges. In 2015, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual participated in 23 individual and 12 small group state public exchanges and in 2016, will participate in individual public exchange offerings in 34 states. The Company is evaluating its level of participation in individual public exchange offerings for 2017. For more detail on our individual public exchange offerings, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes, as well as the needs of individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. Cost pressures are accelerating demand for improved health care affordability and more coordinated care. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is responding to this demand with new network and contracting constructs (such as performance incentives and benefit designs that direct more patients to higher- performing care providers), alternative access to affordable and convenient care (such as through telehealth appointments with registered nurses and physicians) and a new consumer-responsive service model called Advocate4Me. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs).  The market for health benefit products is shifting, with benefit and network offerings shaped, at least in part, by the requirements and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation), increased employer focus on quality and employee engagement and the urgent need to align the system around value. Employers are seeking to offer comprehensive health benefits that improve the health and wellness of their populations and as a result, lower overall health care costs, while improving employee satisfaction. By promoting a healthy workforce, employers can maximize productivity and lower overall health care costs. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers affordable products and actionable information to enable better health outcomes and to help employers attract and retain talent. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals major product families include: Traditional Products. Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options from managed plans, such as Choice and Options PPO, to more traditional indemnity products. The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs and consumer education. During 2015, nearly 35,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including nearly 400 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased HRA or HSA products from us. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefits management products, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options. All UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual members are provided access to clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, which contribute to improved health and lowered medical expenses. Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts or individuals) and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals clinical programs include: ##TABLE_START  wellness programs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  decision support; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  utilization management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  case and disease management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complex condition management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mental health/substance use disorder management; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employee assistance programs. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. Specialty Offerings . UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also delivers dental, vision, life and disability product offerings through an integrated approach, including a network of more than 22,000 vision offices and more than 80,000 dental offices, in private and retail settings. UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans.  UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans responsibility as a contractor is to augment the militarys direct care system by providing managed care support services, provider networks, medical management, claims/enrollment administration and customer service. UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans is the provider of health care services for nearly 3 million active duty and retired military service members and their families in 21 states under the Department of Defenses (DoD) TRICARE Managed Care Support contract. The contract began on April 1, 2013. The DoD is moving from three to two regions for 2017. The government intends to make a decision in the spring of 2016, for contracts to begin delivering services on or about April 1, 2017. UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans has submitted bids to offer services under the new contracts. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers a selection of products that allow people to obtain the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is positioned to serve seniors who find that affordable, network-based care provided through Medicare Advantage plans meets their unique health care needs. For those who prefer traditional fee-for-service Medicare, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers both Medicare Supplement and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) prescription drug programs that supplement their government-sponsored Medicare by providing additional benefits and coverage options. Beneficiaries with special needs are served through UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement Dual, Chronic and Institutional Special Needs Plans (SNPs) in many markets. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirements seniors-focused care management model enables it to operate at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare. This model is based on more than 20 years of expertise in chronic disease care management, underpinned by a proprietary technology platform. These capabilities help improve the health and well-being of older, disabled or otherwise vulnerable individuals. For example, through UnitedHealth Groups HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed approximately 1 million in-home preventative care visits in 2015 to identify, document and help close gaps in care for seniors. Premium revenues from the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) represented 26% of UnitedHealth Groups total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients: AARP, the nations largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through employer groups and agent channels. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirements major product categories include: Medicare Advantage.  UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS, including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and SNPs. Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement served more than 3 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2015. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. Starting in 2012, and phased in through 2017, the Medicare Advantage rate structure and quality rating bonuses are changing significantly. See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers innovative care management, disease management and other clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through its continuum of Medicare Advantage products. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to reach out to those members and create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers two stand-alone Medicare Part D plans: the AARP MedicareRx Preferred and the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare enrolled more than 8 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including more than 5 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans and more than 3 million in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement.  UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is currently serving more than 4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover the various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State UnitedHealthcare Community  State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 5 million beneficiaries. Health Reform Legislation provided for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. Currently, UnitedHealthcare Community  State serves people through Medicaid expansion programs in 13 states. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation, including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends. The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community  State and its participation are: ##TABLE_START  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children - 21 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CHIP - 21 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD) - 19 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  SNP - 14 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medicaid Expansion - 13 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) - 11 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  childless adults programs for the uninsured - 3 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services) - 6 markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MMP - 2 markets. ##TABLE_END These health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care. The LTSS market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTSS population is made up of 3 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTSS programs and represent a subset of the 16 million ABD Americans. Currently, 25% of the ABD population and 28% of the LTSS eligible population are served by comprehensive risk-based managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs. There are more than 10 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. MMP beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. While these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and improve peoples health status through close coordination of care. While dual eligibles account for just 15% of the total Medicaid population, they account for approximately 35% of total Medicaid spending. As of December 31, 2015, UnitedHealthcare served nearly 350,000 people with complex conditions similar to those in an MMP population in legacy programs through Medicare Advantage dual SNPs and UnitedHealthcare Community  State served 24,000 people through MMP programs in Ohio and Texas. UnitedHealthcare Global UnitedHealthcare Global participates in international markets through national in country and cross-border strategic approaches. UnitedHealthcare Globals cross-border health care business provides comprehensive health benefits, care management and care delivery for multinational employers, governments and individuals around the world. UnitedHealthcare Globals goal is to create business solutions that are based on local expertise, infrastructure, culture and needs.

OptumHealth enables population health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and, increasingly, directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth products and services deliver value by improving quality and patient satisfaction while lowering cost. OptumHealth builds high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health management and by coordinating care for the most medically complex patients. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, and on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and local care delivery businesses. OptumHealth is organized into two primary operating groups: OptumCare and Optum Consumer Solutions (OCS). OptumCare ##TABLE_START  OptumCare partners closely with care providers to improve both the health of the populations they serve and the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of local care systems. Through networks comprised of employed, managed and contracted physicians, advanced practitioners and other providers, OptumCare assists care providers in adopting new approaches and technologies that improve collaboration and coordination among everyone involved in patient care. OptumCare also enables care providers transition from traditional, fee-for-service care delivery to performance-based delivery and payment models that put patient health and outcomes first, such as those emerging through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and local care provider partnerships. OptumCare builds partnerships with care providers who share its focus on creating strong and sustainable new approaches to care delivery and works with them to develop and deliver services around the spectrum of patient and community needs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mobile Care Delivery.

OCS also offers electronic claims payment services to care providers through Optum Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with more than 3.8 million accounts and $4.2 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, Optum Bank processed more than $100 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. ##TABLE_END OptumInsight OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. OptumInsights capabilities are focused on modernizing the health system through technology, analytics and information that help drive higher quality and greater efficiency in the health care system. Hospital systems, physician practices, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. Many of OptumInsights software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and outsourcing contracts are delivered over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with OptumInsights customers. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2015, was $10.4 billion, of which $5.9 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $3.8 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2014, was $8.6 billion. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements. OptumInsights products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications. OptumInsight provides capabilities targeted to the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospital systems), payers, governments and life sciences organizations. Care Providers. Serving five out of six U.S. hospitals and tens of thousands of physician practices, OptumInsight provides capabilities that help drive financial performance, meet compliance requirements and deliver health intelligence. OptumInsight brings an array of solutions to help care providers, with particular focus on clinical performance and quality improvement, population health management, data management and analytics, revenue management, cost containment, compliance, cloud-enabled collaboration and consumer engagement. Payers. OptumInsight serves approximately 300 health plans by helping them improve operational and administrative efficiency, understand and optimize growth while managing risk, deliver on clinical performance and compliance goals and build and manage strong provider networks. OptumInsight is also helping payer clients adapt to new market models, including health insurance exchanges, consumer-driven health care and engagement, pay-for-value contracting and population health management. Governments. OptumInsight provides services to federal and state government clients that are tailored to them as government payers, including data and analytics technology, claims management and payment accuracy services and strategic consulting.

OptumInsight provides services to global life sciences organizations. These companies look to OptumInsight for data analytics and expertise in core areas of health economics and outcomes research; market access and reimbursement consulting; integrated clinical and health care claims data and informatics services; epidemiology and drug safety; and patient reported outcomes. OptumRx OptumRx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy care services to more than 66 million people in the United States through its network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and multiple home delivery facilities throughout the country. In 2016, OptumRx expects to manage nearly $80 billion in pharmaceutical spending, including more than $28 billion in specialty pharmaceutical spending. OptumRxs pharmacy care services deliver a low-cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit through retail network contracting, including rebate management and clinical programs such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management programs. The 2015 acquisition of Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran) allows OptumRx to better serve more people.

Additionally, OptumRx manages specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcares businesses with services, including patient support and clinical programs designed to ensure quality and deliver value for consumers. OptumRx also provides pharmacy care services to non-affiliated external clients, including a number of health plans, large national employer plans, unions and trusts and government entities. These clients rely on OptumRx for components or all of their pharmacy care services. OptumRxs distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales.  GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military  Veterans business, such as our TRICARE contract with the DoD. Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust. Health Care Reform. Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation expanded dependent coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not satisfied, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, introduced new risk sharing programs, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-10, the new system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with health care in the United States replaced ICD-9 code sets as of October 1, 2015, and health plans and providers are now required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date. Coding informs analytics and patient care decision making, so accuracy is critical to achieving the highest quality of care and delivering the best possible outcomes for patients. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. In 2014, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that requires us to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. The first report was filed with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that states regulation, last year. It will be filed with both jurisdictions annually thereafter. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. Assessments are generally based on a formula relating to our premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through premiums. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty association assessments. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRxs businesses include home delivery and specialty pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery and specialty pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, disease management companies and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Anthem, Inc., Centene Corporation, Cigna Corporation, Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, outlook, plan, project, should or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise over 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial, Medicare Advantage and certain state-based Medicaid health plans to maintain minimum MLRs, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products. In addition, our OptumCare business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2015 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2015 would have been reduced by approximately $210 million, excluding any offsetting impact from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty association assessments. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, banking regulations, distributor and producer licensing requirements, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, fee-splitting rules, health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our Amil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting the managed care and to insurance industries and regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation, such as Health Reform Legislation and associated exchanges. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Due to its complexity, ongoing implementation and continued legal challenges, Health Reform Legislations full impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us. For example, Health Reform Legislation includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. In addition, if we do not maintain certain minimum loss ratios, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers. These changes can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Health Reform Legislation required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers and requires insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges to offer a minimum level of benefits and includes guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations. While risk adjustment applies to most individual and small group plans in the commercial markets, actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions. Our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of individuals who gain coverage under Health Reform Legislation varies from our expectations, if the demand for Health Reform Legislation related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated. For a discussion of individual exchange-compliant products, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of Health Reform Legislation, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, under Health Reform Legislation, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MMP managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MMP demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model, our chart review programs and related processes. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. While we transitioned to ICD-10 as a HIPAA-regulated entity, providers may use ICD-10 codes differently than they used ICD-9 codes in the past, which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment or increased medical costs for full-risk health insurance products. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, Brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, health care usage, and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements attention and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of certain businesses, including OptumCare and Amil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships. The primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2015 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015 , goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $53 billion , representing 47% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents, that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third-parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customers data. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and credit ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES ##TABLE_END MARKET PRICES AND HOLDERS Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol UNH. On January 29, 2016, there were 13,501 registered holders of record of our common stock. The per share high and low common stock sales prices reported by the NYSE and cash dividends declared for our last two fiscal years were as follows: ##TABLE_START  High  Low  Cash Dividends Declared      First quarter $ 123.76  $ 98.46  $ 0.3750 Second quarter $ 124.11  $ 111.12  $ 0.5000 Third quarter $ 126.21  $ 95.00  $ 0.5000 Fourth quarter $ 125.99  $ 109.61  $ 0.5000            First quarter $ 83.32  $ 69.57  $ 0.2800 Second quarter $ 83.05  $ 73.61  $ 0.3750 Third quarter $ 88.85  $ 78.74  $ 0.3750 Fourth quarter $ 104.00  $ 80.72  $ 0.3750 ##TABLE_ENDDIVIDEND POLICY In June 2015, our Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share compared to the annual dividend rate of $1.50 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2014. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During 2015, the Company repurchased 10.7 million shares at an average price of $112.45 per share, including less than one million shares at an average price of $115.01 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2015. PERFORMANCE GRAPHS The following two performance graphs compare our total return to stockholders with the returns of indexes of other specified companies and the SP 500 Index. The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group) for the five-year period ended December 31, 2015 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to stockholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2015 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2010 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences among the companies in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy. ##TABLE_START  12/10  12/11  12/12  12/13  12/14  12/15 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 142.19  $ 154.40  $ 217.75  $ 297.14  $ 351.39 SP 500 Index 100.00  102.11  118.45  156.82  178.29  180.75 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  99.97  118.45  151.40  159.47  164.65 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group markets. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Health Reform Legislation included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. Health Reform Legislation also included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). Health plans have generally reflected the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Reinsurance Program (together, ACA Fees) in their pricing. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. In 2015, health plans pricing returned to a more normal year-over-year inflation after pricing for higher costs due to ACA Fees in 2014. As always, the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. This will impact our pricing for contracts that renew during 2016 but cover all or portions of 2017. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties. We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. Consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2015 cost trends were largely driven by unit cost pressures from health care providers. In 2016, we expect continued unit cost pressure and a modest increase in utilization. We endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. Our 2016 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs have unexpected price increases. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider reimbursement models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2015, we served more than 14 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2015, our contracts with value-based spending total nearly $46 billion annually, up from $13 billion in 2011. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items. For additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. The final 2016 Medicare Advantage rates were more stable than in recent years, with an expected average increase in industry funding of approximately 1.25%. However, these rates still trail the typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3% which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans for 2016. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans star ratings. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans membership and revenue. Beginning in 2015, quality bonus payments were paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. We expect that approximately 56% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2016 compared with approximately 39% of members in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2015. We further expect that at least 63% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance. Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. The industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax was $11.3 billion in 2015 and will remain at that level in 2016. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017, on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The Health Insurance Industry Tax will again be imposed for 2018 and beyond. In 2016, we expect that our share of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will increase to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion in 2015 due to growth in our business. The Reinsurance Program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements. The total three year amount of $25 billion for the Reinsurance Program is allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the U.S. Treasury. The actual 2014 Reinsurance Program contributions totaled approximately $9.7 billion, which was $2.3 billion short of the expected amount; all was used to fund the Reinsurance Program. While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds. For detail on the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Individual Public Exchanges. After a measured approach to the individual public exchange market in 2014 in which we participated in only four states, we expanded significantly in 2015 to participate in 23 states. In 2016, we are expanding our individual public exchange offerings by 11 states to a total of 34 states. Recent data, however, has caused us to reconsider our long-term position in the individual public exchange market. We have seen lower consumer participation than we and others expected, lower government expectations for future consumer participation, declining performance in and accelerating failures of government-sponsored cooperatives and worsening of our own claims experience. We have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for in-force contracts as of January 1, 2016. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., increased prices and eliminated marketing and commissions) to contain membership growth. By mid-2016 we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the individual public exchange market in 2017.

See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements for more information. ##TABLE_END 2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 RESULTS Our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran on July 23, 2015. Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the Catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of Optums businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. Medical costs also included losses on individual exchange-compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual exchange-compliant contracts and a new state Medicaid contract. Operating Cost Ratio The decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of Catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and Company wide productivity gains.

Medicare Advantage participation increased year-over-year primarily due to growth in people served through employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of health reform related Medicaid expansion, states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in established programs, partially offset by a decrease of 175,000 people in one market where an additional offering was introduced by the state in the first quarter of 2015. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. The number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to pricing and underwriting disciplines in Brazil in response to regulatory actions and declining employment levels in Brazil. UnitedHealthcares revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcares operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual exchange-compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity. Optum Total revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. The operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities. OptumInsight Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of Catamaran as well as strong organic growth. Operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin Catamaran business. For more information about Catamaran, see Note 3 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements. 2014 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2013 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of Optums businesses. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. To the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the ACA Fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. This decrease from ACA Fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Operating Cost Ratio The increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of ACA Fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains. Income Tax Rate The increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover ACA Fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. These increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of Medicare Advantage funding. UnitedHealthcares operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by ACA Fees, Medicare Advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis C and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups. Optum Total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at OptumRx and growth at OptumHealth. The increases in Optums earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in care delivery and subacute care services. Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities. OptumInsight Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth. OptumRx Increased OptumRx revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in UnitedHealthcares public and senior markets, the insourcing of UnitedHealthcares commercial pharmacy benefit programs, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues. Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In 2015, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our stockholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

These increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax and the payment of Reinsurance Program fees in 2015. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the Catamaran acquisition. 2014 Cash Flows Compared to 2013 Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities, including the collection of Reinsurance Program fees in advance of remittance in 2015, partially offset by an increase in government receivables. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in Part D subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2015 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $31.2 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $286 million was available for general corporate use), $18.6 billion of debt securities and $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2015 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-stockholders equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2015, our debt to debt-plus-stockholders equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 47%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In July 2015, we issued debt to fund the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on this debt issuance, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Negative  A+  Negative  A-  Negative  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. We expect continued moderated share repurchase activity through 2016 following the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Dividends. In June 2015, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2015, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2017 to 2018  2019 to 2020  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 7,651  $ 7,938  $ 4,564  $ 26,569  $ 46,722 Operating leases      2,080 Purchase obligations (b)      Future policy benefits (c)     1,936  2,629 Unrecognized tax benefits (d)        Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e)      1,477  1,666 Other obligations (f)      Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g)   1,453     1,736 Total contractual obligations  $ 8,862  $ 10,661  $ 5,646  $ 30,704  $ 55,873 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (g) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2015, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2015 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million , $420 million and $680 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2015 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (122 ) 0.50  (244 ) 0.75  (365 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical Cost PMPM Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2015 :  ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (242 ) (2)  (485 ) (3)  (727 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2015 , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2015 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2015 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2015 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $83 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2015. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. During 2015, we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 of each year. The change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. This change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Intangible Assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2015. Investments Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that it would increase short- term interest rates to a range between 25 and 50 basis points. Fed officials emphasized that they intend to raise rates gradually, if necessary. We estimate a 25 basis point rise in short-term interest rates impacts the fair-value of our investments by $200 million. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. The judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. for more information. As of December 31, 2015 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real. As of December 31, 2015, we had $12.9 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2015, $12.9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, $17.1 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $21.9 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities (c) 2 %  $  $  $ (1,388 )  $ (3,233 )    (702 )  (1,746 ) (1)  (80 )  (55 )   2,085 (2)  nm  nm  1,132  4,442            December 31, 2014 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2%  $  $  $ (1,364 )  $ (1,846 )    (683 )  (1,014 ) (1)  (54 )  (21 )   1,242 (2)  nm  nm   2,770 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) The year over year change in the fair value of financial liabilities was driven by the issuance of debt to fund the Catamaran acquisition. For more information on our debt issuances, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $300 million and $660 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) ##TABLE_ENDReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  ##TABLE_START  / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 9, 2016

Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other policy liabilities and other current receivables and valuations of certain investments. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Reclassification During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its accounting policy for the presentation of certain pharmacy fulfillment costs related to its OptumRx business. These costs are now included in medical costs and cost of products sold, whereas they were previously included in operating costs. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification increased medical expenses by $376 million and $369 million , decreased operating costs by $418 million and $421 million and increased cost of products sold by $42 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The reclassification had no impact on total operating costs, earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Reincorporation On July 1, 2015, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated changed its state of incorporation from Minnesota to Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion. The reincorporation was approved by the Companys stockholders at its 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 1, 2015. Upon reincorporation, the affairs of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated became subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, a new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws, and each previously outstanding share of UnitedHealth Group Incorporateds common stock as a Minnesota corporation (UNH Minnesota) converted into an outstanding share of common stock of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated as a Delaware corporation after the reincorporation (UNH Delaware). The reincorporation was a tax-free reorganization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and did not affect the Companys business operations. Revenues Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Companys customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Additionally, the Companys market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets are subject to risk adjustment provisions as discussed in Premium Stabilization Programs  below. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 13 for additional information regarding these audits. For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy care services business, revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities, and from administrative services, including claims processing and formulary design and management. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. The Company has entered into retail service contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless if the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the period the related services are performed. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For both risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. The Company develops estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends. The Company estimates liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the medical costs payable estimates recorded in prior periods develop, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Medical costs also include the direct cost of patient care. Cost of Products Sold The Companys cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its mail and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Companys transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Companys investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age and other related products. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from its general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For more detail on the RSF, see Other Policy Liabilities below. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, reinsurance and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and records rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. For details on the Companys reinsurance receivable see Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other policy liabilities or other current receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. Health Reform Legislation mandated a consumer discount on brand name prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Accordingly, amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in unearned revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy benefit costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in medical costs and operating costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2015 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2016, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015  December 31, 2014 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $ 1,703  $  $   $ 1,801  $  $ Other policy liabilities          ##TABLE_ENDProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. During 2015, the Company changed its annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 of each year. The change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of the Companys long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. This change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2015 . Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 . Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities The Company had checks outstanding of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the change in this balance has been reflected within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of both December 31, 2015 and 2014, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included accrued payroll liabilities of $1.5 billion . Other Policy Liabilities Other policy liabilities include the RSF associated with the AARP Program, health savings account deposits, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under Health Reform Legislation, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. At the customers option, these balances may be refunded or used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts. Changes in the RSF are reported in medical costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the balance in the RSF was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. Future Policy Benefits and Reinsurance Receivable Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. As a result of the 2005 sale of the life and annuity business within the Companys Golden Rule Financial Corporation subsidiary under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement, the Company has maintained a liability associated with the reinsured contracts, as it remains primarily liable to the policyholders, and has recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable due from the purchaser. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with Golden Rule as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Other current receivables  $  $ Other assets  1,610  1,669 Other policy liabilities  (133 )  (127 ) Future policy benefits  (1,610 )  (1,669 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and only records the reinsurance receivable to the extent of probable recovery. As of December 31, 2015 , the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as A+. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 : ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period  $ 1,388  $ 1,175 Net earnings    Acquisitions   Redemptions  (116 )   Distributions  (19 )  (40 ) Fair value and other adjustments   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period  $ 1,736  $ 1,388 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably; primarily over two to five years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over four to six years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, (collectively, common stock equivalents) using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise, any unrecognized compensation cost and any related excess tax benefit. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Companys applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method of allocation over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2015, the Company paid its full year 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax of $1.8 billion . There was no liability or asset related to the Health Insurance Industry Tax recorded as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014 as the Health Insurance Industry Tax was paid in September of both years and the asset was fully expensed by each year end. Premium Stabilization Programs Health Reform Legislation has included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). The risk-adjustment provisions apply to market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets. Under the program, each covered member is assigned a risk score based upon demographic information and applicable diagnostic codes from the current year paid claims, in order to determine an average risk score for each plan in a particular state and market risk pool. Generally, a plan with a risk score that is less than the states average risk score will pay into the pool, while a plan with a risk score that is greater than the states average will receive money from the pool. The temporary risk corridors provisions are intended to limit the gains and losses of individual and small group qualified health plans. Plans are required to calculate the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) risk corridor ratio of allowable costs to the defined target amount. Qualified health plans with ratios below 97% are required to make payments to HHS, while plans with ratios greater than 103% expect to receive funds from HHS. The Reinsurance Program is a transitional three year program through 2016 that is funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements. For the Premium Stabilization Programs, the Company records a receivable or payable as an adjustment to premium revenue based on year-to-date experience when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final adjustments or recoverable amounts to the Premium Stabilization Programs are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) as modified by ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entitys insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies can adopt the new standard either using the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption at the original effective date, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent on a classified balance sheet. ASU -2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2016 and companies are permitted to apply ASU 2015-17 either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption of ASU 2015-17 is permitted. The Company plans to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2016. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently issued or adopted accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.  Business Combination On July 23, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran) and funded Catamarans payoff of its outstanding debt and credit facility for a total of $14.3 billion in cash. This combination diversifies OptumRxs customer and business mix, while enhancing OptumRxs technology capabilities and flexible service offerings. Catamaran offers pharmacy benefits management services similar to OptumRx to a broad client portfolio, including health plans and employers serving 35 million people, and provides health care information technology solutions to the pharmacy benefits management industry. The Company paid for the acquisition primarily with the proceeds of new indebtedness. Debt issuances included $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, approximately $2.4 billion of commercial paper and a $1.5 billion term loan. The total consideration exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $15.6 billion , of which $5.4 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $10.2 billion to goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Acquired tangible assets (liabilities) for Catamaran at acquisition date were: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Cash and cash equivalents  $ Accounts receivable and other current assets  2,005 Rebates receivable  Property, equipment and other long-term assets  Accounts payable and other current liabilities  (2,525 ) Deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities  (1,923 ) Total net tangible liabilities  $ (1,327 ) ##TABLE_ENDSince the Catamaran acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2015, the preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to Catamarans finite-lived intangible assets were: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except years)  Fair Value  Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related  $ 5,278  19 years Trademarks and technology   4 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets  $ 5,437  19 years ##TABLE_ENDThe results of operations and financial condition of Catamaran have been included in the Companys consolidated results and the results of the OptumRx segment as of July 23, 2015. Through December 31, 2015, the Catamaran business has generated $12.4 billion in revenue and had an immaterial impact on net earnings. Unaudited pro forma revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as if the acquisition of Catamaran had occurred on January 1, 2014 were $172 billion and $152 billion , respectively.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting neither a significant deterioration since purchase nor other factors leading to an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). As of December 31, 2015 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The Companys investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total OTTI  $ (22 )  $ (26 )  $ (8 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income       Net OTTI recognized in earnings  (22 )  (26 )  (8 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (28 )  (47 )  (9 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains (included in investment and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)    Income tax effect (included in provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)  (53 )  (77 )  (66 ) Realized gains, net of taxes  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END5. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during 2015 or 2014 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries that also have similar revenue and growth characteristics and preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based on recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Other Assets. The fair values of the Companys other assets are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-Related Investments. AARP Program-related investments consist of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt and equity securities. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information, including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. AARP Program-Related Other Liabilities. AARP Program-related other liabilities consist of liabilities that represent the amount of net investment gains and losses related to AARP Program-related investments that accrue to the benefit of the AARP policyholders. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding AARP Program-related assets and liabilities, which are presented in a separate table below: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2015         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 10,906  $  $   $ 10,923 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,779     1,977 State and municipal obligations    6,168    6,168 Corporate obligations   7,308   7,406 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,124    2,124 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,784  16,749   18,631 Equity securities - available-for-sale  1,223    1,639 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value $ 13,913  $ 16,873  $  $ 31,286 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ December 31, 2014         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 7,472  $  $   $ 7,495 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,427     1,620 State and municipal obligations    6,668    6,668 Corporate obligations   7,257   7,327 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,056    2,056 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,429  17,048   18,551 Equity securities - available-for-sale  1,200    1,522 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value  $ 10,101  $ 17,145  $  $ 27,630 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2015           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Other assets  $   $  $   $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 29,455  $   $ 29,455  $ 28,107 December 31, 2014           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Other assets  $   $  $   $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 18,863  $   $ 18,863  $ 17,085 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

See below for more information on the Companys interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) The Company terminated the interest rate swap contracts on these hedged instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015. See below for more information on this termination. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Debt issued to fund the Catamaran acquisition. For more detail on Catamaran, see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_END The Companys long-term debt obligations also included $164 million and $150 million of other financing obligations, of which $47 million and $34 million were current as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    $ 6,630  3,491  2,607  1,024  1,952 Thereafter  16,432 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Paper and Revolving Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2015 , the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.7% . The Company has $3.0 billion five-year, $2.0 billion three-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in December 2020 , December 2018 , and November 2016 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2015 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 1.2% to 1.7% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-stockholders equity ratio of not more than 55% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2015 . Interest Rate Swap Contracts The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of its interest rate exposure from fixed rates to floating rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its variable rate financial assets. The floating rates are benchmarked to LIBOR. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges on the Companys fixed-rate debt. Since the critical terms of the swaps match those of the debt being hedged, they are considered to be highly effective hedges and all changes in the fair values of the swaps are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the related debt with no net impact recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Both the hedge fair value changes and the offsetting debt adjustments are recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the location and fair value of the interest rate swap fair value hedges on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet: ##TABLE_START Type of Fair Value Hedge  Notional Amount  Fair Value  Balance Sheet Location   (in billions)  (in millions)   December 31, 2015       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 5.1  $  Other assets      Other liabilities December 31, 2014       Interest rate swap contracts  $ 10.7  $  Other assets      Other liabilities ##TABLE_ENDDuring 2015, the Company terminated $5.2 billion notional amount of its interest rate swap fair value hedges. The resulting gain was not material.

Income Taxes The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended  December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 4,155  $ 3,883  $ 3,004 State and local    Total current provision  4,436  4,154  3,241 Deferred (benefit) provision  (73 )  (117 )  Total provision for income taxes  $ 4,363  $ 4,037  $ 3,242 ##TABLE_ENDThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 3,581  35.0 %  $ 3,380  35.0 %  $ 3,120  35.0 % Health insurance industry tax   6.1   4.8     State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.4   1.6   1.4 Tax-exempt investment income  (44 )  (0.4 )  (49 )  (0.5 )  (53 )  (0.6 ) Non-deductible compensation   1.0   1.0   0.5 Other, net  (49 )  (0.5 )  (13 )  (0.1 )   0.1 Provision for income taxes  $ 4,363  42.6 %  $ 4,037  41.8 %  $ 3,242  36.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe higher tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the increase in the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Accrued expenses and allowances  $  $ U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards   Share-based compensation   Nondeductible liabilities   Medical costs payable and other policy liabilities   Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards   Unearned revenues   Unrecognized tax benefits   Other-domestic   Other-non-U.S.   Subtotal  1,866  1,530 Less: valuation allowances  (44 )  (119 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,822  1,411 Deferred income tax liabilities:     U.S. federal and state intangible assets  (2,951 )  (1,275 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets  (397 )  (496 ) Capitalized software  (574 )  (506 ) Net unrealized gains on investments  (34 )  (129 ) Depreciation and amortization  (312 )  (272 ) Prepaid expenses  (205 )  (140 ) Other-non-U.S.  (76 )  (102 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities  (4,549 )  (2,920 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (2,727 )  $ (1,509 ) ##TABLE_ENDValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $122 million expire beginning in 2021 through 2035; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2016 through 2035. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $459 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions      Prior year tax positions    Acquired reserves      Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (2 )     Settlements  (1 )     Statute of limitations lapses  (9 )  (1 )  (5 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $137 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain major jurisdictions. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statement of Operations. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized $11 million , $6 million and $4 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $59 million and $33 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2014 and prior. The Companys 2015 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2008 tax year. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Companys Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. 11. Stockholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion , including $1.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion , including $1.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2015, $286 million of the Companys $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents was available for general corporate use. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2015, the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to stockholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2014, the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. During 2015, the Company repurchased 10.7 million shares at an average price of $112.45 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion . As of December 31, 2015, the Company had Board authorization to purchase up to 61 million shares of its common stock. Dividends In June 2015, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to equal an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share compared to the annual dividend rate of $1.50 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2014. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Companys dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date  Amount per Share  Total Amount Paid     (in millions)  $ 1.8750  $ 1,786  1.4050  1,362  1.0525  1,056 ##TABLE_END 12. Share-Based Compensation In June 2015, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan). The approved amendment increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by 70 million and removed certain limits in the Plan. The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 85 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2015 , there were also 12 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options and SARs Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value  (in millions)    (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period  $     Granted      Exercised (7 )      Forfeited (1 )      Outstanding at end of period   6.0  $ 1,666 Exercisable at end of period   3.4  1,133 Vested and expected to vest, end of period   5.9  1,646 ##TABLE_ENDRestricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period   $ Granted   Vested  (5 )  Nonvested at end of period   ##TABLE_ENDOther Share-Based Compensation Data ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts)  For the Years Ended December 31,    Stock Options and SARs       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share  $  $  $ Total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised    Restricted Shares       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share    Total fair value of restricted shares vested  $  $  $ Employee Stock Purchase Plan       Number of shares purchased    Share-Based Compensation Items       Share-based compensation expense, before tax  $  $  $ Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects    Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (in millions, except years)  December 31, 2015 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards  $ Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense  1.3 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and SARs were as follows: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31,     Risk-free interest rate  1.6% - 1.7%  1.7% - 1.8%  1.0% - 1.6% Expected volatility  22.3% - 24.1%  24.1% - 39.6%  41.0% - 43.0% Expected dividend yield  1.4% - 1.7%  1.6% - 1.9%  1.4% - 1.6% Forfeiture rate  5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years  5.5 - 6.1  5.4  5.3 ##TABLE_ENDRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2015, 2014 and 2013.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $553 million and $496 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 13. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $555 million , $449 million and $438 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2015, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2017  2018  2019  2020  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $30 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.1 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters California Claims Processing Matter.  On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. Although the Company believes that CDI had never before issued a fine in excess of $8 million , CDI advocated a fine of approximately $325 million in this matter. The matter was the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge beginning in December 2009, and in August 2013, the administrative law judge issued a nonbinding proposed decision recommending a fine of $11.5 million . The California Insurance Commissioner rejected the administrative law judges recommendation and on June 9, 2014, issued his own decision imposing a fine of approximately $174 million . On July 10, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit in California state court challenging the Commissioners decision. On September 8, 2015, in the first phase of that lawsuit, the California state court issued an order invalidating certain of the regulations the Commissioner had relied upon in issuing his decision and penalty. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the wide range of possible outcomes, the legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting a regulatory fine in the event of a remand, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review that remain available to the Company. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other things, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. The Company has produced documents, information and witnesses to the Department of Justice in cooperation with a current review of the Companys risk-adjustment processes, including the Companys patient chart review and related programs. CMS has selected certain of our local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits and reviews in which it is currently involved given the status of the reviews, the wide range of possible outcomes and inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, the Companys legal and factual defenses and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies (including state health insurance cooperatives) that write the same line or similar lines of business. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation and petitioned a state court for approval to liquidate Penn Treaty. In 2012, the court denied the liquidation petition and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to submit a rehabilitation plan. The court held a hearing in July 2015 to begin its consideration of the latest proposed rehabilitation plan. The hearing is scheduled to continue in the spring of 2016. If the current proposed rehabilitation plan, which contemplates the partial liquidation of Penn Treaty, is approved by the court, the Companys insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treatys policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments. The Company continues to vigorously challenge the proposed rehabilitation plan. The Company is currently unable to estimate losses or ranges of losses because the Company cannot predict when or to what extent Penn Treaty will ultimately be liquidated, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of any associated guaranty fund assessments or the availability and amount of any premium tax and other potential offsets. 14. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and financial needs of individuals, enabling population health management and local care delivery through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and relationship management and sales distribution platform services and financial services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight is a health care information, technology, operational services and consulting company providing software and information products, advisory consulting services and business process outsourcing services and support to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system use OptumInsight to reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail pharmacy network management services, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 26% for 2015, and 29% for both 2014 and 2013, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 96% , 95% and 95% of consolidated total revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 81% and 73% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2015. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting of the Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran) acquisition. Such exclusion was in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. We acquired Catamaran during July 2015. Catamaran represented 16% of our consolidated total assets and 8% of our consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 9A.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Catamaran Corporation (Catamaran), which was acquired during July 2015 and whose financial statements collectively constitute 16% of consolidated total assets and 8% of consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Catamaran. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2015. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 9, 2016 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone. The terms we, our, us, its, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and other individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community  State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global includes UnitedHealthcare Brazil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, health care delivery and health care operations. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2016, we processed more than one half trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed more than $200 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcares market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  innovation for customers and consumers. ##TABLE_ENDUnitedHealthcare utilizes Optums capabilities to help coordinate patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler consumer experienc e. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1 million physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,000 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under Government Regulation and in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individuals. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides access to medical services for over 30 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners. This includes more than 200,000 employer customers across all 50 states. Products are offered through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served.

UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet the coverage needs of employers of all sizes. The market for health benefit products is shifting, with benefit and network offerings shaped, at least in part, by the requirements and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations, increased employer focus on quality and employee engagement and the urgent need to align the system around value. Cost pressures are stimulating demand for improved health care affordability and more coordinated care. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual is responding to this demand with medical network and contracting constructs (such as performance incentives and benefit designs that direct more patients to higher-performing care providers), alternative access to affordable and convenient care (such as through telehealth appointments with registered nurses and physicians) and a consumer-responsive service called Advocate4Me.

Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement served 3.6 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2016. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirements senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. Through UnitedHealth Groups HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed more than 1 million in-home preventative care visits in 2016 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to reach out to those members and create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options.

UnitedHealthcare Community  State UnitedHealthcare Community  State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2016, UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served 5.9 million beneficiaries. The Affordable Care Act provided for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, UnitedHealthcare Community  State served more than 1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 15 states. States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation, including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends. The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community  State and its participation are: ##TABLE_START  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children - 22 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CHIP - 21 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Aged, Blind and Disabled - 20 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  SNP - 15 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medicaid Expansion - 15 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Long-Term Services and Supports - 12 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  childless adult programs for the uninsured - 2 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services) - 5 markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MMP - 2 markets. ##TABLE_END These health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only 40% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community  States business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care, which represents a population of nearly 8 million people; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state-carve-ins of populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care. This expansion includes integrated management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community  State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model allows UnitedHealthcare Community  State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care; typically, the 5% of members who are most at risk and drive over 50% of states medical costs.

OptumHealth products and services deliver value by improving quality and patient satisfaction while lowering cost. OptumHealth builds high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health management and by coordinating care for the most medically complex patients. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served, or on a fee-for-service basis, where it delivers medical services to patients in exchange for a contracted fee. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). OptumHealth serves patients and care providers through its local ambulatory care services business and delivers care through a physician-led, patient-centric and data-driven organization comprised of over 20,000 employed, managed and contracted physicians. OptumHealth also enables care providers transition from traditional, fee-for-service care delivery to performance-based delivery and payment models that put patient health and outcomes first, such as those emerging through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and local care provider partnerships.

OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs), risk adjustment and reinsurance data. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies. Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust. Affordable Care Act. The ACA expanded access to coverage and modified aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. Among other requirements, the ACA expanded dependent coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain MLRs are not satisfied, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, introduced new risk sharing programs, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. The ACA is affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the ACA and related matters. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) imposed requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extended parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; added federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthened enforcement and imposed higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposed criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. Reports are filed annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that states regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. Guaranty Fund Assessments . Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. Assessments are generally based on a formula relating to our premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through premiums. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty associations. Pharmacy Regulation. OptumRxs businesses include home delivery and specialty pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery and specialty pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies maintain eligibility as Medicare and state Medicaid providers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Consumer Protection Laws. Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health and well-being services company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, population health management companies and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Anthem, Inc., Centene Corporation, Cigna Corporation, Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, outlook, plan, project, should or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial, Medicare Advantage and certain state-based Medicaid health plans to maintain minimum MLRs, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products. In addition, our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2016 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2016 would have been reduced by approximately $240 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment, reinsurance or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, banking regulations, distributor and producer licensing requirements, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, fee-splitting rules, health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Brazil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. The ACA could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Due to its complexity and continued uncertainty, the ACAs impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us. The ACA includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. In addition, if we do not maintain certain MLRs, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers. These requirements can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of individuals who gain coverage under the ACA varies from our expectations, if the demand for the ACA related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated.  The Trump Administration and Congressional Leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the ACA. We cannot predict if the ACA will be modified, repealed or replaced, but changes to this law could materially impact our operating results, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, under the ACA, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MMP managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MMP demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model, our chart review programs and related processes. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. In addition, the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union imposes higher potential penalties and more stringent compliance and data security requirements on our ability to collect, process and transfer personal data relating to our European businesses. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. In the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, Brazil and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, health care usage, and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements attention and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of certain businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Brazil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships. The physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through independent producers and consultants with whom we do not have exclusive contracts and for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commissions. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. If we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions, they could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2016 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016 , goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $56 billion , representing 46% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents, that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third-parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customers data. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt and capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

The high and low per share common stock sales prices reported by the NYSE and cash dividends declared for our last two fiscal years were as follows: ##TABLE_START  High  Low  Cash Dividends Declared      First quarter $ 131.10  $ 107.51  $ 0.500 Second quarter $ 141.31  $ 125.26  $ 0.625 Third quarter $ 144.48  $ 132.39  $ 0.625 Fourth quarter $ 164.00  $ 133.03  $ 0.625            First quarter $ 123.76  $ 98.46  $ 0.375 Second quarter $ 124.11  $ 111.12  $ 0.500 Third quarter $ 126.21  $ 95.00  $ 0.500 Fourth quarter $ 125.99  $ 109.61  $ 0.500 ##TABLE_ENDDIVIDEND POLICY In June 2016, our Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.50 per share compared to the annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2015. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the fourth quarter 2016, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at an average price of $141.54 per share. As of December 31, 2016, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 51 million shares of our common stock. PERFORMANCE GRAPHS The following two performance graphs compare our total return to shareholders with the returns of indexes of other specified companies and the SP 500 Index. The first graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group) for the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 . The second graph compares our cumulative total return to shareholders with the SP 500 Index and an index of a group of peer companies selected by us for the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 . We are not included in either the Fortune 50 Group index in the first graph or the peer group index in the second graph. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies in the first graph and the peer group companies in the second graph are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2011 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. Fortune 50 Group The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences among the companies in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy.  ##TABLE_START  12/11  12/12  12/13  12/14  12/15  12/16 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 108.59  $ 153.15  $ 208.98  $ 247.13  $ 342.05 SP 500 Index 100.00  116.00  153.58  174.60  177.01  198.18 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  118.48  151.44  159.51  164.70  186.76 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Recent Developments We have recognized in our financial results for the fourth quarter 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2016 the previously disclosed $350 million impact of our estimated share of guaranty association assessments resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), following accounting, legal and regulatory consultations in connection with our 10-K filing. This charge will be funded over several years and affected by premium tax credits over time. For more detail related to the Penn Treaty liquidation, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, Brazilian and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the risk adjustment that impacts the small group and individual markets. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2017 will reflect the impact of the moratorium. Additionally, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.  We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. Our 2017 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs experience price increases. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2016, we served more than 15 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2016, our contracts with value-based elements total nearly $53 billion in annual spending. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2017 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 0.85%, well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3%, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of this funding shortfall in Medicare Advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service payment rates. These factors can affect our plan benefit designs, pricing, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. As provided in the ACA, our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, Star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans membership and revenue. For the 2016 payment year, approximately 57% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher. We expect that at least 80% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and Star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance. Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. The industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax was $11.3 billion in 2016 and we paid our portion of the tax, which was $1.8 billion, in September 2016. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The Health Insurance Industry Tax is scheduled to be imposed for 2018 and beyond. In 2018, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax is expected to be $14.3 billion. The ACA also included three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompassed: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance and temporary risk corridors programs expired at the end of 2016. Individual Public Exchanges. In 2016, we participated in individual public exchanges in 34 states and offered individual ACA compliant products. We recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for in-force contracts as of January 1, 2016. During 2016, we incurred additional losses in our individual ACA compliant products and, for 2017, reduced our participation to three individual public exchanges. We expect to reduce the number of consumers we serve through individual insurance plans by nearly 1 million people in 2017, which will reduce our premium revenues by more than $4 billion.

Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues were primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across all of our Optum services businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends, partially offset by medical management initiatives. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the adoption of the ASU 2016-09, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2016. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 , of this report for more information about the adoption of ASU 2016-09.

Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of new state-based awards and growth in established programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. UnitedHealthcares revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends. The increase in UnitedHealthcares operating earnings was due to diversified growth, offset by guaranty fund assessments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. For more information on these assessments, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Operating earnings in 2015 included the establishment of premium deficiency reserves for 2016, primarily for individual ACA compliant business. Optum Total revenues and operating earnings increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to growth in its health care delivery businesses as well as expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. Strong performance in business supporting UnitedHealthcare partially offset by investments in the health care delivery business drove the increase in earnings from operations. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management, business process outsourcing and technology services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to the full-year impact of Catamaran and organic growth. In 2016, OptumRx fulfilled 1.24 billion adjusted scripts compared to 932 million in 2015. 2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the Catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of Optums businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. Medical costs also included losses on individual ACA compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual ACA compliant contracts and a new state Medicaid contract. Operating Cost Ratio The decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of Catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and Company wide productivity gains. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcares operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual ACA compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity. Optum Total revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. The operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities. OptumInsight Revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of Catamaran as well as strong organic growth. Operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin Catamaran business. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In 2016, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of Catamaran. 2015 Cash Flows Compared to 2014 Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in risk-based products, which increased medical costs payable and an increase in CMS risk share payables, which increased other liabilities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax and the payment of Reinsurance Program fees in 2015. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the Catamaran acquisition. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2016 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $36.7 billion included $10.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $700 million was available for general corporate use), $24.2 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2016 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2016, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 44%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In February 2016, we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings, which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes, and to repay our 5.375% notes that were due March 15, 2016. In December 2016, we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings, which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes. For more information on these debt issuances, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  Standard  Poors  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Negative  A+  Negative  A-  Negative  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2016 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 51 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Dividends. In June 2016, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.50 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2016, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2018 to 2019  2020 to 2021  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 8,262  $ 6,282  $ 6,059  $ 27,899  $ 48,502 Operating leases      2,310 Purchase and other obligations (b)      1,707 Future policy benefits (c)     1,980  2,657 Unrecognized tax benefits (d)        Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e)     2,288  2,576 Redeemable noncontrolling interests (f)   1,054      2,012 Total contractual obligations  $ 10,717  $ 9,009  $ 7,221  $ 33,070  $ 60,017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2016, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2016 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $220 million , $320 million and $420 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2016 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (144 ) 0.50  (288 ) 0.75  (430 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2016 : ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (186 ) (2)  (371 ) (3)  (557 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2016 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2016 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2016 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $90 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analysis. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview- Business Trends above and the discussion in the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2016. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2016. Investments Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment.  Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. The judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2016 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real. As of December 31, 2016, we had $13.2 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2016, $12.4 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, $21.9 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $25.2 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 %  $  $  $ (1,711 )  $ (3,470 )    (873 )  (1,860 ) (1)  (105 )  (95 )   2,244 (2)  nm  nm  1,562  4,784            December 31, 2015 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2%  $  $  $ (1,388 )  $ (3,233 )    (702 )  (1,746 ) (1)  (80 )  (55 )   2,085 (2)  nm  nm  1,132  4,442 ##TABLE_ENDnm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Brazils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Brazils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $400 million and $900 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. ", "8": " ITEM 8.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,

##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within the Companys two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates of other current liabilities and other current receivables and valuations of certain investments. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Companys customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans Star ratings. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of the Companys plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members. As a result, revenues are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time on either a time and materials basis, or ratably as services are performed or made available to customers. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Companys estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2016. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims that have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Companys cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its mail and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Companys transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Companys investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age and other related products. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from the Companys general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and records rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 3.3 billion and $2.6 billion , respectively. For details on the Companys Medicare Part D receivables see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits below. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits The Company serves as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are seven separate elements of payment received by the Company during the plan year. These payment elements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  CMS Premium. CMS pays a fixed monthly premium per member to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Member Premium. Additionally, certain members pay a fixed monthly premium to the Company for the entire plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Premium Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays some or all of the members monthly premiums to the Company on the members behalf. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy . CMS pays the Company a cost reimbursement estimate monthly to fund the CMS obligation to pay approximately 80% of the costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out-of-pocket maximum. A settlement is made with CMS based on actual cost experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy. For qualifying low-income members, CMS pays on the members behalf some or all of a members cost sharing amounts, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The cost sharing subsidy is funded by CMS through monthly payments to the Company. The Company administers and pays the subsidized portion of the claims on behalf of CMS, and a settlement payment is made between CMS and the Company based on actual claims and premium experience, after the end of the plan year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CMS Risk-Share. Premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions that compare costs targeted in the Companys annual bids by product and region to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances of more than 5% above or below the original bid submitted by the Company may result in CMS making additional payments to the Company or require the Company to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums it received. The Company estimates and recognizes an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience to date. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires the Company to consider factors that may not be certain, including estimates of eligible pharmacy costs and member eligibility status differences with CMS. The Company records risk-share adjustments to premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other current liabilities or other current receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Drug Discount. The ACA mandated a consumer discount on brand name prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This discount is funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while the Company administers the application of these funds. Accordingly, amounts received are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as deposits. The Company records a liability when amounts are received from CMS and a receivable when the Company bills the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ##TABLE_END The CMS Premium, the Member Premium and the Low-Income Premium Subsidy represent payments for the Companys insurance risk coverage under the Medicare Part D program and, therefore, are recorded as premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Premium revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive prescription drug benefits. The Company records premium payments received in advance of the applicable service period in unearned revenues in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy and the Low-Income Member Cost Sharing Subsidy (Subsidies) represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. Amounts received for these Subsidies are not reflected as premium revenues, but rather are accounted for as receivables and/or deposits. Related cash flows are presented as customer funds administered within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Pharmacy care costs and administrative costs under the contract are expensed as incurred and are recognized in medical costs and operating costs, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The final 2016 risk-share amount is expected to be settled during the second half of 2017, and is subject to the reconciliation process with CMS. The Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts associated with the Medicare Part D program: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016  December 31, 2015 (in millions)  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share  Subsidies  Drug Discount  Risk-Share Other current receivables  $  $  $   $ 1,703  $  $  Other current liabilities         ##TABLE_ENDProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2016 . Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016 . Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities The Company had checks outstanding of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the change in this balance has been reflected within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ( $5.7 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively), the RSF associated with the AARP Program, deposits under the Medicare Part D program (see Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits above), accruals for premium rebate payments under the ACA, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Future Policy Benefits Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 : ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period  $ 1,736  $ 1,388 Net earnings   Acquisitions   Redemptions  (123 )  (116 ) Distributions  (11 )  (19 ) Fair value and other adjustments   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period  $ 2,012  $ 1,736 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably; primarily over two to five years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP, (collectively, common stock equivalents) using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and any unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax The ACA includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Companys applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method of allocation over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Premium Stabilization Programs The ACA included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). The risk-adjustment provisions apply to market reform compliant individual and small group plans in the commercial markets. Under the program, each covered member is assigned a risk score based upon demographic information and applicable diagnostic codes from the current year paid claims, in order to determine an average risk score for each plan in a particular state and market risk pool. Generally, a plan with a risk score that is less than the states average risk score will pay into the pool, while a plan with a risk score that is greater than the states average will receive money from the pool. The temporary risk corridors provisions are intended to limit the gains and losses of individual and small group qualified health plans. Plans are required to calculate the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) risk corridor ratio of allowable costs to the defined target amount. Qualified health plans with ratios below 97% are required to make payments to HHS, while plans with ratios greater than 103% expect to receive funds from HHS. The Reinsurance Program and temporary risk corridors program expired at the end of 2016. For the Premium Stabilization Programs, the Company records a receivable or payable as an adjustment to premium revenue based on year-to-date experience when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final adjustments or recoverable amounts to the Premium Stabilization Programs are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entitys balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, an entity can elect to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense the lease over a straight-line basis for the term of the lease. ASU 2016-02 will require new disclosures that depict the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows pertaining to an entitys leases. Companies are required to adopt the new standard using a modified retrospective approach for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. When adopted, the Company does not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on its results of operations, equity or cash flows. The impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Companys consolidated financial position will be based on leases outstanding at the time of adoption. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). The new guidance changes the current accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Most notably, ASU 2016-01 requires that equity investments, with certain exemptions, be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income as opposed to other comprehensive income. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, based on equity securities held, the Company does not expect ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows. The Company will continue to evaluate any changes in its mix of investments or market conditions and the related impact of ASU 2016-01. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) as modified by ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Technical Corrections and Improvements. ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entitys insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies may adopt the new standard either using the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The Company early adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2017, as allowed, using the modified retrospective approach. As the majority of the Companys revenues are not subject to the new guidance, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 modifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards, including income tax consequences, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2016. The provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures were adopted using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of January 1, 2016. The provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement and classification in the statement of cash flows were adopted prospectively and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-17, deferred taxes were required to be presented as a net current asset or liability and a net noncurrent asset or liability. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2016 and the prior period was not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not impact the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows. In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts (ASU 2015-09). ASU 2015-09 requires insurance entities to provide additional disclosures about short-duration insurance liabilities, including incurred and paid medical costs information by year. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU 2015-09 and has included the new disclosures within Notes 2 and 7 . In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as an asset on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, as required, in the first quarter of 2016. The Company reclassified $129 million and $82 million in debt issuance costs that were recorded in other assets to long-term debt, less current maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The Companys investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, venture capital funds and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Net realized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings  $ (45 )  $ (22 )  $ (26 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (44 )  (28 )  (47 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains (included in investment and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)    Income tax effect (included in provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)  (60 )  (53 )  (77 ) Realized gains, net of taxes  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there was no transfer between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries that also have similar revenue and growth characteristics and preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based on recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt and equity securities. Other Assets. The fair values of the Companys other assets are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. Interest Rate Swaps. Fair values of the Companys swaps are estimated using the terms of the swaps and publicly available information, including market yield curves. Because the swaps are unique and not actively traded but are valued using other observable inputs, the fair values are classified as Level 2. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2016         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 10,386  $  $   $ 10,430 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  2,017     2,264 State and municipal obligations    7,059    7,059 Corporate obligations   10,804   10,927 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,927    2,927 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    1,002    1,002 Total debt securities - available-for-sale  2,038  22,039   24,179 Equity securities  1,591    2,041 Assets under management  1,064  2,041    3,105 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value $ 15,079  $ 24,192  $  $ 39,810 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ December 31, 2015         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 10,906  $  $   $ 10,923 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  1,779     1,977 State and municipal obligations    6,168    6,168 Corporate obligations   7,308   7,406 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,124    2,124 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities      Total debt securities - available-for-sale  1,784  16,749   18,631 Equity securities  1,223    1,639 Assets under management   2,166    2,998 Interest rate swap assets       Total assets at fair value  $ 14,745  $ 19,039  $  $ 34,284 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % Interest rate swap liabilities  $   $  $   $ ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2016           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Other assets  $   $  $   $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 31,295  $   $ 31,295  $ 29,337 December 31, 2015           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Other assets  $   $  $   $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 29,455  $   $ 29,455  $ 27,978 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

See Note 2 for more information on the adoption of ASU 2015-03. ##TABLE_END The Companys long-term debt obligations also included $200 million and $164 million of other financing obligations, of which $80 million and $47 million were current as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Maturities of commercial paper and long-term debt for the years ending December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    $ 7,185  2,622  1,769  1,955  2,407 Thereafter  17,284 ##TABLE_ENDCommercial Paper and Revolving Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2016 , the Companys outstanding commercial paper had a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.9% . The Company has $3.0 billion five-year, $2.0 billion three-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in December 2021 , December 2019 , and December 2017 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2016 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 1.6% to 2.2% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 55% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2016 . 9. Income Taxes The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended  December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 4,397  $ 4,155  $ 3,883 State and local    Total current provision  4,709  4,436  4,154 Deferred provision (benefit)   (73 )  (117 ) Total provision for income taxes  $ 4,790  $ 4,363  $ 4,037 ##TABLE_ENDThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 4,152  35.0 %  $ 3,581  35.0 %  $ 3,380  35.0 % Health insurance industry tax   5.4   6.1   4.8 State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.7   1.4   1.6 Share-based awards - excess tax benefit  (158 )  (1.3 )         Non-deductible compensation   1.1   1.0   1.0 Other, net  (182 )  (1.5 )  (93 )  (0.9 )  (62 )  (0.6 ) Provision for income taxes  $ 4,790  40.4 %  $ 4,363  42.6 %  $ 4,037  41.8 % ##TABLE_ENDDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws.

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $74 million expire beginning in 2021 through 2036; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2017 through 2036. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had $717 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be reinvested in non-U.S. operations. Because these earnings are considered permanently reinvested, no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions      Prior year tax positions    Acquired reserves      Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (4 )  (2 )   Settlements  (6 )  (1 )   Statute of limitations lapses  (12 )  (9 )  (1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $197 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 the Company recognized $11 million , $11 million and $6 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $70 million and $59 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2015 and prior. The Companys 2016 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2010 tax year. The Brazilian federal revenue service - Secretaria da Receita Federal (SRF) may audit the Companys Brazilian subsidiaries for a period of five years from the date on which corporate income taxes should have been paid and/or the date when the tax return was filed. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion , including $3.3 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion , including $1.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. As of December 31, 2016 , approximately $700 million of the Companys $10.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents was available for general corporate use. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $17.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 . Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2016 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2014, the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data)   Common share repurchases, shares   Common share repurchases, average price per share  $ 128.97  $ 112.45 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost  $ 1,280  $ 1,200 Board authorized shares remaining   ##TABLE_ENDDividends In June 2016, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to equal an annual dividend rate of $2.50 per share compared to the annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2015. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 11. Share-Based Compensation The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had 68 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2016 , there were also 10 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options and SARs Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value  (in millions)    (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period  $     Granted      Exercised (8 )      Forfeited (1 )      Outstanding at end of period   6.6  $ 2,758 Exercisable at end of period   4.0  1,458 Vested and expected to vest, end of period   6.6  2,704 ##TABLE_ENDRestricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period   $ Granted   Vested  (3 )  Nonvested at end of period   ##TABLE_ENDOther Share-Based Compensation Data ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts)  For the Years Ended December 31,    Stock Options and SARs       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share  $  $  $ Total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised    Restricted Shares       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share    Total fair value of restricted shares vested  $  $  $ Employee Stock Purchase Plan       Number of shares purchased    Share-Based Compensation Items       Share-based compensation expense, before tax  $  $  $ Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects    Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (in millions, except years)  December 31, 2016 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards  $ Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense  1.3 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and SARs were as follows: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31,     Risk-free interest rate  1.2% - 1.4%  1.6% - 1.7%  1.7% - 1.8% Expected volatility  20.8% - 22.5%  22.3% - 24.1%  24.1% - 39.6% Expected dividend yield  1.8%  1.4% - 1.7%  1.6% - 1.9% Forfeiture rate  5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years  5.6 - 5.9  5.5 - 6.1  5.4 ##TABLE_ENDRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company also offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $672 million and $553 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 12. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $608 million , $555 million and $449 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2018  2019  2020  2021  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $28 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.2 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Litigation Matters California Claims Processing Matter.  On January 25, 2008, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) issued an Order to Show Cause to PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, alleging violations of certain insurance statutes and regulations related to an alleged failure to include certain language in standard claims correspondence, timeliness and accuracy of claims processing, interest payments, care provider contract implementation, care provider dispute resolution and other related matters. Although the Company believes that CDI had never before issued a fine in excess of $8 million , CDI advocated a fine of approximately $325 million in this matter. The matter was the subject of an administrative hearing before a California administrative law judge beginning in December 2009, and in August 2013, the administrative law judge issued a nonbinding proposed decision recommending a fine of $11.5 million . The California Insurance Commissioner rejected the administrative law judges recommendation and on June 9, 2014, issued his own decision imposing a fine of approximately $174 million . On July 10, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit in California state court challenging the Commissioners decision. On September 8, 2015, in the first phase of that lawsuit, the California state court issued an order invalidating certain of the regulations the Commissioner had relied upon in issuing his decision and penalty. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the procedural status of the dispute, the wide range of possible outcomes, the legal issues presented (including the legal basis for the majority of the alleged violations), the inherent difficulty in predicting a regulatory fine in the event of a remand, and the various remedies and levels of judicial review that remain available to the Company. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. The Company has produced documents, information and witnesses to the Department of Justice in cooperation with a current review of the Companys risk-adjustment processes, including the Companys patient chart review and related programs. CMS has selected certain of the Companys local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Companys health plans. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from any material government investigations, audits and reviews in which it is currently involved given the status of the reviews, the wide range of possible outcomes and the inherent difficulty in predicting regulatory action, fines and penalties, if any, the Companys legal and factual defenses and the various remedies and levels of judicial review available to the Company in the event of an adverse finding. Guaranty Fund Assessments Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation and petitioned a state court for approval to liquidate Penn Treaty. In 2012, the court denied the liquidation petition and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to submit a rehabilitation plan. A second amended plan of rehabilitation was later withdrawn and, as of November 2016, Penn Treaty will be liquidated. As of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded the $350 million impact of its estimated share of guaranty association assessments resulting from the Penn Treaty liquidation. 13. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide and active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of individuals, enabling population health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care ##TABLE_ENDdelivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. ##TABLE_START  OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 25% for 2016, 26% for 2015 and 29% for 2014, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97% , 96% and 95% of consolidated total revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 75% and 81% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2016. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2016 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2016. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 8, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 8, 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. The terms we, our, us, its, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and other individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community  State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global includes the provision of health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance, leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, health care delivery and health care operations. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2017, we processed nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed nearly $250 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health care industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. UnitedHealthcare Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcares market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  strong local market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  innovation for customers and consumers. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optums capabilities to help coordinate patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler consumer experienc e. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1.2 million physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,500 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under Government Regulation and in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individuals. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides access to medical services for over 27 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners. This includes more than 230,000 employer customers serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and SNPs. Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement served 4.4 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2017. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirements senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. Through UnitedHealth Groups HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed nearly 1.3 million in-home preventive care visits in 2017 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and allow care managers to create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options.

Premium revenues from CMS represented 28% of UnitedHealth Groups total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community  State UnitedHealthcare Community  State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2017, UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 28 states and the District of Columbia, and served 6.7 million beneficiaries; including more than 1.1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 16 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation, including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community  State and its participation are: ##TABLE_START  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children - 26 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  CHIP - 25 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Aged, Blind and Disabled - 22 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  SNP - 20 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medicaid Expansion - 16 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Long-Term Services and Supports - 14 markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MMP - 2 markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other programs (e.g., administrative services, childless adults, developmentally disabled) - 9 markets. ##TABLE_ENDThese health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants that can impact peoples health status and health system usage. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only 40% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community  States business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care, which represents a population of nearly 8 million people; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care. This expansion includes integrated management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community  State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model allows UnitedHealthcare Community  State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care; typically, the 5% of members who are most at risk and drive over 50% of states medical costs.

OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served, or on a fee-for-service basis, where it delivers medical services to patients in exchange for a contracted fee. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies).

OptumInsights capabilities are focused on data and analytics, technology and information that help improve the quality of care and drive greater efficiency in the health care system. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, advance quality, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. Many of OptumInsights software and information products and professional services are delivered over extended periods, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with OptumInsights customers. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2017, was $15.0 billion, of which $8.3 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $5.4 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2016, was $12.6 billion. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements. OptumInsights products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications. OptumInsight believes it is well positioned to address the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physicians and hospital systems), health plans, governments and life sciences companies.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of our businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies. In addition, our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or Tax Reform). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed existing United States tax law and includes numerous provisions that will affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For instance, Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changed business-related exclusions and deductions and credits. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) imposed requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extended parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; added federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthened enforcement and imposed higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposed criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation . Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted model regulations that, where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. Reports are filed annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that states regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and PBM Regulations OptumRxs businesses include home delivery and specialty pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery and specialty pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As certain of our home delivery and specialty pharmacies maintain eligibility as Medicare and state Medicaid providers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted in a number of states could impact our business practices. Additionally, organizations like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners periodically issue model regulations and credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards that impact PBM, mail or specialty pharmacy activities. While these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. There is both federal and state legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, HMOs, TPAs, PBMs and business services outsourcing companies, health care professionals that have formed networks to contract directly with employers or with CMS, specialty benefit providers, government entities, population health management companies and various health information and consulting companies. For our UnitedHealthcare businesses, our competitors include Aetna Inc., Anthem, Inc., Centene Corporation, Cigna Corporation, Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and, with respect to our Brazilian operations, several established competitors in Brazil and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. For our OptumRx businesses, our competitors include CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC. New entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. We compete on the basis of the sales, marketing and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer engagement and satisfaction; the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network and clinical management capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength; and marketplace reputation. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, outlook, plan, project, should or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial, Medicare Advantage and certain state-based Medicaid health plans to maintain minimum MLRs, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products. In addition, our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2017 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2017 would have been reduced by approximately $235 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA are being debated, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified or repealed or replaced. Additionally, the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Brazil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. For example, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. Additionally, such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third-parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers data. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, in May 2018, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation will overhaul data protection laws in the European Union. The new regulation will supersede current European Union data protection legislation, may impose more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and may prescribe greater penalties for noncompliance. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty pharmacies and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the FDA and Boards of Pharmacy. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pharmacy care services businesses in connection with services for which our pharmacy care services businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, South America and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other health care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage, and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, divert managements attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency) and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of some of our businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Brazil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships as employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and HMO competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or HMO companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We are routinely subject to various litigation actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. While we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete intensely. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. If we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions, such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, HMOs, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2017 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income, and the continuation of the current low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017 , goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $63 billion , representing 45% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.

Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the fourth quarter 2017, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $210.97 per share. As of December 31, 2017, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 42 million shares of our common stock. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following performance graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index and a customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies (the  Fortune 50 Group) for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 . We are not included in the Fortune 50 Group index. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2012 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. Although there are differences among the companies in terms of size and industry, like UnitedHealth Group, all of these companies are large multi-segment companies using a well-defined operating model in one or more broad sectors of the economy.  ##TABLE_START  12/12  12/13  12/14  12/15  12/16  12/17 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 141.03  $ 192.45  $ 227.59  $ 314.99  $ 440.44 SP 500 Index 100.00  132.39  150.51  152.59  170.84  208.14 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  127.82  134.63  139.01  157.63  161.63 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care delivery, management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2018 reflected the impact of the returning Health Insurance Industry Tax. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.  We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2017, we served nearly 16 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared- risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2017, our contracts with value-based elements total nearly $65 billion in annual spending. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2018 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 0.45%, well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3%, as well as the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018, described below, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of this funding shortfall in Medicare Advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service payment rates. These factors can affect our plan benefit designs, pricing, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, and adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, Star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plans membership and revenue. For the 2017 payment year, approximately 80% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher. We expect that at least 85% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2018. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and Star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance. Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The Company re-measured deferred taxes as of the date of enactment, which resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction to the net deferred tax liability and corresponding increase to earnings in 2017. With Tax Reform, we expect that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 24%. Health Insurance Industry Tax. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In 2018, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will be $14.3 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately $2.8 billion. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019.

Consolidated Financial Results Revenue The increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the Optum business. The increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the ACA-compliant products in the individual market and the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, offset primarily by the reduction in individual ACA business, medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform and the Health Insurance Tax moratorium. The provision for income taxes included the $1.2 billion benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.

Fee-based commercial group business declined due to the non-renewal of one public sector customer. Membership in individual business decreased due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant products in 2017. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of new state-based awards and growth in established programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. UnitedHealthcares revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which were partially offset by the reduction of people served in ACA-compliant individual products and the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. The increase in UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations was led by diversified growth and increased operating margin. The 2016 results included losses in ACA-complaint individual products and guaranty fund assessments. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management services and business process services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to client and consumer growth. In 2017, OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts compared to 1.2 billion in 2016. 2016 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2015 RESULTS Our results of operations were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran in the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues were primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across all of our Optum services businesses. Medical Costs Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends, partially offset by medical management initiatives. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the adoption of Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2016. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue growth was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcares operating earnings increased due to diversified growth, offset by guaranty fund assessments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Optum Total revenues and operating earnings increased as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to growth in its health care delivery businesses as well as expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. Strong performance in business supporting UnitedHealthcare partially offset by investments in the health care delivery business drove the increase in earnings from operations. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management, business process outsourcing and technology services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to the full-year impact of Catamaran and organic growth. In 2016, OptumRx fulfilled 1.2 billion adjusted scripts compared to 932 million in 2015. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In 2017, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances, which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments. 2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities increased slightly as higher net earnings were mostly offset by increased CMS receivables and other operating items. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of Catamaran. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2017 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $42.4 billion included $12.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $800 million was available for general corporate use), $28.4 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of Double A as of December 31, 2017 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2017, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 37%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2017 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  SP Global  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Stable  A+  Negative (a)  A-  Stable  bbb+  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-2  n/a ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) In January 2018, SP Global affirmed our ratings and changed our outlook to Stable. ##TABLE_END The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2017 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 42 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Dividends. In June 2017, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders by 20% to an annual dividend rate of $3.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2017, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2019 to 2020  2021 to 2022  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 4,006  $ 7,017  $ 7,241  $ 30,609  $ 48,873 Operating leases      3,082 Purchase and other obligations (b)      2,454 Other liabilities (c)     5,589  6,980 Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d)  1,575     2,189 Total contractual obligations  $ 7,775  $ 9,409  $ 8,863  $ 37,531  $ 63,578 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END Pending Acquisitions. In December 2017, we entered into agreements to acquire two companies in the health care sector for a total of approximately $7.7 billion, which are not reflected in the table above. One of the acquisitions closed in January 2018; the other is expected to close later in 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2017, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2017 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2017, 2016 and 2015 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $690 million , $220 million and $320 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2017 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (160 ) 0.50  (320 ) 0.75  (478 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2017 : ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (208 ) (2)  (415 ) (3)  (623 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2017 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2017 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2017 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $110 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. Risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview- Business Trends above and the discussion in the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2017. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2017. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2017 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real. As of December 31, 2017, we had $15 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2017, $8.5 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, $25.9 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $28.7 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 %  $  $  $ (1,958 )  $ (4,546 )    (933 )  (2,460 ) (1)  (150 )  (85 )   2,923 (2)  (197 )  (133 )  1,773  6,414   December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2%  $  $  $ (1,711 )  $ (3,470 )    (873 )  (1,860 ) (1)  (105 )  (95 )   2,244 (2)  nm  nm  1,562  4,784 ##TABLE_END nm = not meaningful ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction, respectively, in interest income or interest expense, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as the rate cannot fall below zero. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Brazils operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Brazils assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $500 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. ", "8": " ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinions These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. ##TABLE_START  / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 13, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.

##TABLE_ENDSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ##TABLE_START 1. Description of Business ##TABLE_END UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, UnitedHealth Group and the Company) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets and estimates of other current liabilities and other current receivables. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Companys customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans Star ratings. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Companys plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. OptumHealths service revenues include net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. As of December 31, 2017 , accounts receivables related to products and services were $3.7 billion . In 2017 , the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs  recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 . For the year ended December 31, 2017 , revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price), was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 13 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Companys estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2017. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims that have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Companys cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its mail and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Companys transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of investments, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Companys investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age and other related products. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from the Companys general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates from two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Companys Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2017 . Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 . Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ( $6.4 billion and $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively), deposits under the Medicare Part D program ( $1.6 billion , and $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively), the RSF associated with the AARP Program, accruals for premium rebate payments under the ACA, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period  $ 2,012  $ 1,736 Net earnings   Acquisitions   Redemptions  (309 )  (123 ) Distributions  (38 )  (11 ) Fair value and other adjustments  (112 )  Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period  $ 2,189  $ 2,012 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over two to five years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and any unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax The ACA includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Companys applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entitys balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, an entity may elect to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense the lease over a straight-line basis for the term of the lease. ASU 2016-02 will require new disclosures that depict the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows pertaining to an entitys leases. Companies are currently required to adopt the new standard using a modified retrospective approach for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. When adopted, the Company does not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on its results of operations, equity or cash flows. The impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Companys consolidated financial position will be based on leases outstanding at the time of adoption. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). The new guidance changes the current accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of certain equity investments, (ii) the presentation of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are due to instrument-specific credit risk, and (iii) certain disclosures associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Most notably, ASU 2016-01 requires that equity investments, with certain exemptions, be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income as opposed to other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018 as required. ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) as modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20 (collectively ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 superseded existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entitys insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company early adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2017, as allowed, using the modified retrospective approach. A significant majority of the Companys revenues are not subject to the new guidance. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The Companys investments in equity securities consist of investments in Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments and dividend paying stocks. The Company evaluated its investments in equity securities for severity and duration of unrealized loss, overall market volatility and other market factors. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, the Companys investments included $898 million of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector. Net realized gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were from the following sources: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions)    Total other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings  $ (9 )  $ (45 )  $ (22 ) Gross realized losses from sales  (33 )  (44 )  (28 ) Gross realized gains from sales    Net realized gains (included in investment and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)    Income tax effect (included in provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations)  (30 )  (60 )  (53 ) Realized gains, net of taxes  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END4. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Transfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurs; there was no transfer between Levels 1, 2 or 3 of any financial assets or liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017 or 2016 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 or 2016 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in venture capital portfolios are estimated using a market valuation technique that relies heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Under the market approach, the fair values of the Companys various venture capital investments are computed using limited quantitative and qualitative observations of activity for similar companies in the current market. The Companys market modeling utilizes, as applicable, transactions for comparable companies in similar industries that also have similar revenue and growth characteristics and preferences in their capital structure. Key significant unobservable inputs in the market technique include implied earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples and revenue multiples. Additionally, the fair values of certain of the Companys venture capital securities are based on recent transactions in inactive markets for identical or similar securities. Significant changes in any of these inputs could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt and equity securities. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2017         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 11,718  $  $   $ 11,981 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  2,428     2,644 State and municipal obligations    7,660    7,660 Corporate obligations   12,989   13,194 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    3,911    3,911 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    1,015    1,015 Total debt securities - available-for-sale  2,493  25,791   28,424 Equity securities  1,784    1,992 Assets under management  1,117  1,984    3,101 Total assets at fair value $ 17,112  $ 28,052  $  $ 45,498 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % December 31, 2016         Cash and cash equivalents  $ 10,386  $  $   $ 10,430 Debt securities - available-for-sale:         U.S. government and agency obligations  2,017     2,264 State and municipal obligations    7,059    7,059 Corporate obligations   10,804   10,927 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    2,927    2,927 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities    1,002    1,002 Total debt securities - available-for-sale  2,038  22,039   24,179 Equity securities  1,591    2,041 Assets under management  1,064  2,041    3,105 Total assets at fair value  $ 15,079  $ 24,137  $  $ 39,755 Percentage of total assets at fair value  %  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)  Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Total Fair Value  Total Carrying Value December 31, 2017           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $  $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 34,504  $   $ 34,504  $ 31,542 December 31, 2016           Debt securities - held-to-maturity:           U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $   $   $  $ State and municipal obligations        Corporate obligations      Total debt securities - held-to-maturity  $  $  $  $  $ Long-term debt and other financing obligations  $   $ 31,295  $   $ 31,295  $ 29,337 ##TABLE_ENDThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 2.4% to 2.7% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 55% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2017 . 9. Income Taxes The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended  December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Current Provision:       Federal  $ 3,597  $ 4,302  $ 4,109 State and local    Foreign    Total current provision  4,165  4,709  4,436 Deferred (benefit) provision  (965 )   (73 ) Total provision for income taxes  $ 3,200  $ 4,790  $ 4,363 ##TABLE_END. The reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages)    Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate  $ 4,908  35.0 %  $ 4,152  35.0 %  $ 3,581  35.0 % Change in tax law  (1,199 )  (8.6 )         State income taxes, net of federal benefit   1.4   1.7   1.4 Share-based awards - excess tax benefit  (319 )  (2.3 )  (158 )  (1.3 )     Non-deductible compensation   1.3   1.1   1.0 Health insurance industry tax       5.4   6.1 Foreign rate differential  (282 )  (2.0 )  (105 )  (0.9 )  (34 )  (0.3 ) Other, net  (280 )  (2.0 )  (77 )  (0.6 )  (59 )  (0.6 ) Provision for income taxes  $ 3,200  22.8 %  $ 4,790  40.4 %  $ 4,363  42.6 % ##TABLE_ENDDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Deferred income tax assets:     Accrued expenses and allowances  $  $ U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards   Share-based compensation   Nondeductible liabilities   Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards   Other-domestic   Other-non-U.S.   Subtotal  1,836  2,414 Less: valuation allowances  (64 )  (55 ) Total deferred income tax assets  1,772  2,359 Deferred income tax liabilities:     U.S. federal and state intangible assets  (1,998 )  (3,055 ) Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets  (602 )  (584 ) Capitalized software  (530 )  (707 ) Depreciation and amortization  (236 )  (332 ) Prepaid expenses  (223 )  (228 ) Outside basis in partnerships  (279 )  (132 ) Other-non-U.S.  (86 )  (82 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities  (3,954 )  (5,120 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities  $ (2,182 )  $ (2,761 ) ##TABLE_ENDOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (Tax Reform). Tax Reform changed existing United States tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The Company re-measured deferred taxes as of the date of enactment, which resulted in the $1.2 billion reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities. The Companys measurement of the income tax effects of Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017 is reasonably estimated and, therefore, included in these financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $235 million expire beginning in 2022 through 2037; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2018 through 2037. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2017 , the Companys undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions     Prior year tax positions    Acquired reserves      Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (33 )  (4 )  (2 ) Settlements  (24 )  (6 )  (1 ) Statute of limitations lapses  (4 )  (12 )  (9 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $210 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized $14 million , $11 million and $11 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $84 million and $70 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2017 , there were $472 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Companys 2017 tax year is under advance review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2011 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2012 and forward. 10. Shareholders' Equity Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries in the United States are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion , including $3.3 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 . Optum Bank must meet minimum requirements for Tier 1 leverage capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2017 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2014, the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data)   Common share repurchases, shares   Common share repurchases, average price per share  $ 173.54  $ 128.97 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost  $ 1,500  $ 1,280 Board authorized shares remaining   ##TABLE_ENDDividends In June 2017, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to equal an annual dividend rate of $3.00 per share compared to the annual dividend rate of $2.50 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2016. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 11. Share-Based Compensation The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had 51 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2017 , there were also 9 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Stock Options and SARs Stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life  Aggregate Intrinsic Value  (in millions)    (in years)  (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period  $     Granted      Exercised (12 )      Forfeited (2 )      Outstanding at end of period   6.6  $ 4,443 Exercisable at end of period   4.8  2,412 Vested and expected to vest, end of period   6.6  4,363 ##TABLE_ENDRestricted Shares Restricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period   $ Granted   Vested  (3 )  Nonvested at end of period   ##TABLE_ENDOther Share-Based Compensation Data ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts)  For the Years Ended December 31,    Stock Options and SARs       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share  $  $  $ Total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised  1,473   Restricted Shares       Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share    Total fair value of restricted shares vested  $  $  $ Employee Stock Purchase Plan       Number of shares purchased    Share-Based Compensation Items       Share-based compensation expense, before tax  $  $  $ Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects    Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises    ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (in millions, except years)  December 31, 2017 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards  $ Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense  1.3 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates The principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and SARs were as follows: ##TABLE_START   For the Years Ended December 31,     Risk-free interest rate  1.9% - 2.1%  1.2% - 1.4%  1.6% - 1.7% Expected volatility  18.5% - 20.7%  20.8% - 22.5%  22.3% - 24.1% Expected dividend yield  1.4% - 1.6%  1.8%  1.4% - 1.7% Forfeiture rate  5.0%  5.0%  5.0% Expected life in years  5.7  5.6 - 5.9  5.5 - 6.1 ##TABLE_ENDRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2017, 2016 and 2015.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $865 million and $672 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 12. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $710 million , $608 million and $555 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2019  2020  2021  2022  Thereafter  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $72 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.4 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Pending Acquisition In December 2017, the Company entered into agreements to acquire two companies in the health care sector for a total of approximately $7.7 billion . One of the acquisitions closed in January 2018; the other is expected to close later in 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Companys local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Companys health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblowers complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company, along with a number of other Medicare Advantage plans, made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On March 24, 2017, DOJ intervened in a separate lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed by a whistleblower in 2009 concerning risk adjustment submissions by Medicare Advantage plans. On October 5, 2017, in one of the cases, the district court dismissed certain of DOJs claims with prejudice, and dismissed all of DOJs remaining claims with leave to file a further amended complaint; on October 12, the DOJ filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice of the case. The other case is now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this remaining matter given its current posture. 13. Segment Financial Information Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits and health care delivery. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of individuals, enabling population health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 28% , 25% and 26% for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 96% , 97% and 96% of consolidated total revenues for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 77% and 75% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2017 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2017 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2017 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinions on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2017. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 13, 2018 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END INTRODUCTION Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. The terms we, our, us, its, UnitedHealth Group, or the Company used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community  State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global includes the provision of health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employer groups and individuals in South America, and other diversified global health businesses. Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance, leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, health care delivery and health care operations. Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2018, we processed more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars in gross billed charges and we managed more than $250 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health care industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare Through its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, helping to control rising health care costs and creating a better health care experience for its customers. UnitedHealthcares market position is built on: ##TABLE_START  strong local-market relationships; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  service and advanced technology, including digital consumer engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  competitive medical and operating cost positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  effective clinical engagement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  innovation for customers and consumers. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare utilizes Optums capabilities to help coordinate patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy benefits, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler consumer experienc e. In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include 1.3 million physicians and other health care professionals and more than 6,000 hospitals and other facilities. UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under Government Regulation and in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services nationwide for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides access to medical services for 27 million people on behalf of our customers and alliance partners, including employer customers serving people across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. Products are offered through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs). Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures. Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals served by UnitedHealth Group makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual has relationships with network care providers that integrate data and analytics, implement value-based payments and care management programs, and enable us to jointly better manage health care and improve quality across populations. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers. In addition, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual distributes its products through professional employer organizations, associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals diverse product portfolio offers employers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provides the flexibility to meet a full spectrum of their coverage needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals major product families include: Traditional Products. Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options, and offer a spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection. Consumer Engagement Products. Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs, consumer education and other digital offerings. Clinical and Pharmacy Products. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy care services products, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging consumers and providing cost-saving options. Consumers served by UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual can access clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, which contribute to improved health and lowered medical expenses. Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on offering type (risk-based or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts or individual consumers) and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals clinical programs include: ##TABLE_START  wellness programs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  decision support; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  utilization management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  case and disease management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  complex condition management; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  on-site programs, including biometrics and flu shots; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  incentives to reinforce positive behavior change; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  mental health/substance use disorder management; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employee assistance programs. ##TABLE_END UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individuals comprehensive and integrated pharmacy care services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes, helping consumers take actions to improve their health and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs. Specialty Offerings . Through its broad network, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual delivers dental, vision, hearing, life, transportation, critical illness and disability product offerings using an integrated approach in private and retail settings. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older people. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers a selection of products that allow people to obtain the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change.

Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement served 4.9 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2018. Built on more than 20 years of experience, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirements senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below that of traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. Through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed 1.5 million in-home preventive care visits in 2018 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Medicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of peoples needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2018, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.0 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 4.7 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. Medicare Supplement.  UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement is currently serving 4.9 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at a diversity of price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program. Premium revenues from CMS represented 30% of UnitedHealth Groups total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community  State UnitedHealthcare Community  State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Childrens Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), Dual SNPs (DSNPs), Aged, Blind and Disabled and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2018, UnitedHealthcare Community  State participated in programs in 30 states and the District of Columbia, and served 6.5 million people; including 1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 15 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community  State when choosing programs for participation, including the states commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community  State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community  State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. UnitedHealthcare Community  State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community  State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants that can affect peoples health status and health system usage. Approximately 75% of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only 50% of total Medicaid spending. UnitedHealthcare Community  States business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care, which represents a population of nearly 8 million people; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care. This expansion includes integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration. UnitedHealthcare Community  State continues to evolve its clinical model to enhance quality and the clinical experience for the people it serves. The model enables UnitedHealthcare Community  State to quickly identify the people who could benefit most from more highly coordinated care; typically, the 5% who are most at risk drive over 50% of states medical costs.

OptumHealth engages consumers in managing their health, including guidance, tools and programs that help them achieve their health goals and maintain healthy lifestyles. Optum Financial Services, through Optum Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, serves consumers through 5.2 million health savings and other accounts approaching $10 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, Optum Bank processed nearly $160 billion in digital medical payments to physicians and other health care providers. Organizations across the health system rely on Optum to manage and improve payment flows through its highly automated, scalable, digital payment systems. OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee per individual served, or on a fee-for-service basis, where it delivers medical services to patients in exchange for a contracted fee. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). OptumInsight OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. OptumInsights capabilities are focused on technology, research and consulting and managed services that help improve the quality of care and drive greater efficiency in the health care system.

Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, advance quality, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. Many of OptumInsights software and information products and professional services are delivered over extended periods, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with OptumInsights customers. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2018 was $17.0 billion, of which $8.6 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. The aggregate backlog includes $6.2 billion related to intersegment agreements. OptumInsights aggregate backlog at December 31, 2017, was $15.0 billion. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements. OptumInsights products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsights products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsights products with their applications. OptumInsight believes it is well positioned to address the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physicians and hospital systems), health plans, governments and life sciences companies.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Our businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations. Federal Laws and Regulation We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. UnitedHealthcare Community  State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies. In addition, our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . In December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or Tax Reform). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed existing United States tax law and included numerous provisions that affected our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For instance, Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changed business-related exclusions and deductions and credits. Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) imposed requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; included contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extended parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; added federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthened enforcement and imposed higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposed criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below. ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. State Laws and Regulation Health Care Regulation.  Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by that states regulation. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with the ACA, which may affect our operations and our financial results. Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community  State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. State Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices that involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations OptumRxs businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies that must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies that participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery and specialty pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. Federal and state legislation of PBM activities affect both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) requirements to use particular care providers or distribution channel, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. Additionally, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations and credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards that impact PBM pharmacy activities. While these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. Consumer Protection Laws Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTCs Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. Certain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. Banking Regulation Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the banks compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. International Regulation Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. COMPETITION As a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services, including organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants and business combinations also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve, which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, outlook, plan, project, should or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. In addition, our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts are typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2018 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2018 would have been reduced by approximately $305 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk that they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance companys claims through state guaranty associations. Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. For example, some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA are being considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified or repealed or replaced. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part; and a federal district court struck down the ACA in its entirety as unconstitutional in 2018. That opinion has been stayed and appealed. Further, the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Agncia Nacional de Sade Suplementar, while the Banmdica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations that could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community  State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. For example, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. Additionally, such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns that could negatively affect our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events that could negatively affect our systems, our customers data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, the HITECH amendments to HIPAA imposed further restrictions on our ability to collect, disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on our business. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, effective May 2018, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) overhauled data protection laws in the European Union. The new regulation superseded prior European Union privacy and data protection legislation, imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, goes into effect in 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data. HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and expand it to include business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Through our Optum businesses, including our Optum Labs business, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that may differ from the risks of our other businesses. We provide pharmacy care services through our OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the FDA and Boards of Pharmacy. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims that we entered into certain prohibited transactions. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows  could be materially and adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States, South America and other foreign markets and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular markets, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other health care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. In addition, our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful and relevant to consumers, we may not remain competitive, and we risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage, and we may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, divert managements attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Our health care benefits businesses have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. The success of some of our businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. There is and will likely be heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. In addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We are routinely subject to various legal actions due to the nature of our business, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. While we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. The legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. Any failure by us to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent on efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage. If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges that differ from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies that we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. Our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. A number of investigations have been conducted regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive and have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling those companies products. If we were subjected to similar investigations and enforcement actions, such actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products. Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment can cause lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers, which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optums financial results. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities, which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2018 . Relatively low interest rates on investments, such as those experienced during recent years, have adversely impacted our investment income. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments, which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. There can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018 , our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $68 billion , representing 45% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely impact our credit ratings and potentially impact our compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities. If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. Connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to the health information technology market may present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. There can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will be maintained in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

On January 31, 2019, there were 11,948 registered holders of record of our common stock. DIVIDEND POLICY In June 2018, our Board of Directors increased the Companys annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share compared to $3.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2017. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $256.15 per share. As of December 31, 2018, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 94 million shares of our common stock. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following performance graph compares the cumulative five-year total return to shareholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the SP 500 index, the SP Health Care Index and the Dow Jones US Industrial Average Index for the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 . We have also included the customized peer group of certain Fortune 50 companies that we have compared ourselves to in prior years. We believe that these indices provide a more meaningful comparison than the previous subset of the Fortune 50 given our diverse businesses. The comparisons assume the investment of $100 on December 31, 2013 in our common stock and in each index, and that dividends were reinvested when paid. The Fortune 50 Group consists of the following companies: American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Citigroup Inc., General Electric Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Johnson  Johnson. We are not included in this Fortune 50 Group index. In calculating the cumulative total shareholder return of the indexes, the shareholder returns of the Fortune 50 Group companies are weighted according to the stock market capitalizations of the companies at January 1 of each year. ##TABLE_START  12/13  12/14  12/15  12/16  12/17  12/18 UnitedHealth Group $ 100.00  $ 136.46  $ 161.37  $ 223.35  $ 312.29  $ 357.64 SP Health Care Index 100.00  125.34  133.97  130.37  159.15  169.44 Dow Jones US Industrial Average 100.00  110.04  110.28  128.47  164.58  158.85 SP 500 Index 100.00  113.69  115.26  129.05  157.22  150.33 Fortune 50 Group 100.00  105.33  108.75  123.33  126.45  103.96 ##TABLE_ENDThe stock price performance included in this graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx. ##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2019 reflected the impact of the moratorium. The industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.  We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2018, we served nearly 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2018, our contracts with value-based elements totaled $74 billion in annual spending, including $18 billion through risk-transfer agreements. This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of managements view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2019 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of 3.4%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products, such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law, including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. In 2018, the impact of Tax Reform was partially offset by the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Health Insurance Industry Tax. After a moratorium in 2017, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018 was $14.3 billion, with our portion being $2.6 billion. The return of the tax impacted year-over-year comparability of our financial results, including revenues, the medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio and effective tax rate. A one year moratorium is imposed on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through risk-based products and medical cost trends. The MCR decreased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which more than offset business mix changes and a lower level of favorable reserve development.

Fee-based commercial group business declined primarily due to customers converting their retirees to Medicare Advantage plans, as well as certain customers expanding the number of carriers and reconfiguring geographies served. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs, reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our New Mexico Medicaid plan. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. International growth was primarily driven by an acquisition in the first quarter. UnitedHealthcares revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served across its risk-based businesses, a higher revenue membership mix, rate increases for underlying medical cost trends and the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. UnitedHealthcares operating margin decreased slightly due to the performance of our traditional community-based TANF Medicaid business. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below, as well as productivity and overall cost management initiatives. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery and behavioral health, digital consumer engagement and health financial services. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in data analytics product and service offerings and managed services as well as organic and acquisition-related growth in advisory services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services, and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 1,343 million and 1,298 million adjusted scripts in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2016 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenue The increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the Optum business. The increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the ACA-compliant products in the individual market and the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, offset primarily by the reduction in individual ACA business, medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform and the Health Insurance Tax moratorium. The provision for income taxes included a $1.2 billion benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Reportable Segments UnitedHealthcare UnitedHealthcares revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which were partially offset by the reduction of people served in ACA-compliant individual products and the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. The increase in UnitedHealthcares earnings from operations was led by diversified growth and increased operating margin. The 2016 results included losses in ACA-compliant individual products and guaranty fund assessments. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management services and business process services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to client and consumer growth. In 2017, OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts compared to 1.2 billion in 2016. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In both 2018 and 2017, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net issuances of debt in 2018 compared to net repayments in 2017, an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and a decrease in customer funds administered due to the timing of government payments. 2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances, which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2018 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $44.7 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $925 million was available for general corporate use), $31.9 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of Double A as of December 31, 2018 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of December 31, 2018, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Moodys  SP Global  Fitch  A.M. Best  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook  Ratings  Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3  Stable  A+  Stable  A-  Stable  A-  Stable Commercial paper P-2  n/a  A-1  n/a  F1  n/a  AMB-1  n/a ##TABLE_ENDThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2018 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 94 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Dividends. In June 2018, our Board increased our annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share from $3.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2018, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: ##TABLE_START (in millions)   2020 to 2021  2022 to 2023  Thereafter  Total Debt (a)  $ 3,463  $ 8,970  $ 7,396  $ 37,988  $ 57,817 Operating leases   1,103   1,343  3,876 Purchase and other obligations (b)  1,216  2,205    4,404 Other liabilities (c)  1,206    5,213  6,936 Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d)  1,276     1,908 Total contractual obligations  $ 7,830  $ 12,918  $ 9,247  $ 44,946  $ 74,941 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more detail. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements, unrecognized tax benefits and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as Thereafter. ##TABLE_END Pending Acquisitions. In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately $4.3 billion, which is not reflected in the table above. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2018, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Payable Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2018 , our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2018, 2017 and 2016 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million , $690 million and $220 million , respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2018 :  ##TABLE_START Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) (0.75)%  $ (0.50)  (0.25)  0.25  (181 ) 0.50  (362 ) 0.75  (541 ) ##TABLE_ENDMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors  Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable   (in millions) 3%  $ 2  1  (1)  (234 ) (2)  (469 ) (3)  (703 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2018 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2018 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2018 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $140 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: ##TABLE_START  Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the Medical Cost Trend section of Executive Overview- Business Trends and the Medical Costs Payable critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. As of October 1, 2018, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2018. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2018 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Our primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. As of December 31, 2018, we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2018, $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, $30 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $32 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2018 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum  Interest Expense Per Annum  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 %  $  $  $ (2,242 )  $ (5,017 )    (1,140 )  (2,724 ) (1)  (138 )  (94 )  1,118  3,155 (2)  (276 )  (189 )  2,196  6,953   December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate  Investment Income Per Annum (a)  Interest Expense Per Annum (a)  Fair Value of Financial Assets (b)  Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2%  $  $  $ (1,958 )  $ (4,546 )    (933 )  (2,460 ) (1)  (150 )  (85 )   2,923 (2)  (197 )  (133 )  1,773  6,414 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense in 2017, as the rate cannot fall below zero. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ##TABLE_END We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Globals operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Globals assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 12, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinions These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. ##TABLE_START  / S / DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2019 ##TABLE_ENDWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.

Use of Estimates These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Companys best estimates and judgments. The Companys most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and revenues, valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets and estimates of other current liabilities and other current receivables. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues Premiums Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers health care and related administrative costs. Premium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Companys customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans Star ratings. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues from capitation arrangements at its OptumHealth businesses. The Companys Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Companys plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. Products and Services For the Companys OptumRx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacy facilities. Product revenues include ingredient costs (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. In retail pharmacy transactions, revenues recognized exclude the members applicable co-payment. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed through the retail network or received by consumers through the Companys mail-service pharmacy. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis. Services revenue consists of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. Revenues are also comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. OptumHealths service revenues include net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. OptumInsight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. OptumInsight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , accounts receivables related to products and services were $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion , respectively. In 2018 and 2017 , the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs  recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 or 2017 . For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material. See Note 13 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable The Companys estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2018. Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Companys obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims that have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. Cost of Products Sold The Companys cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery and specialty pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to non-affiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those non-affiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Companys transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. The Company evaluates an investment for impairment by considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost or amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and the Companys intent to sell the security or the likelihood that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Companys investment policy. Assets Under Management The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. Pursuant to the Companys agreement, AARP Program assets are managed separately from the Companys general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Companys discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Other Current Receivables Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. The Companys pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers products by its affiliated and non-affiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion , respectively. Property, Equipment and Capitalized Software Property, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Buildings 35 to 40 years Capitalized software 3 to 5 years ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. Goodwill To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ( $7.5 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively), deposits under the Medicare Part D program, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, accruals for premium rebate payments under the ACA, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. Policy Acquisition Costs The Companys short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Companys subsidiaries whose redemption is outside the control of the Company are classified as temporary equity. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START (in millions)   Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period  $ 2,189  $ 2,012 Net earnings   Acquisitions   Redemptions  (90 )  (309 ) Distributions  (53 )  (38 ) Fair value and other adjustments  (363 )  (112 ) Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period  $ 1,908  $ 2,189 ##TABLE_ENDShare-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employees eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over two to five years and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options and SARs vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options and SARs is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Companys stock at a discounted price, which is 85% of the lower market price of the Companys common stock at the beginning or at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Earnings Per Common Share The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, SARs, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. Health Insurance Industry Tax The ACA includes an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019. The Company estimates its liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax based on a ratio of the Companys applicable net premiums written compared to the U.S. health insurance industry total applicable net premiums, both for the previous calendar year. The Company records in full the estimated liability for the Health Insurance Industry Tax at the beginning of the calendar year with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using a straight-line method over the calendar year. The liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the corresponding deferred cost is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11 and 2018-20 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entitys balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the Company elected to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and expense the leases over a straight-line basis for the term of those leases. ASU 2016-02 requires new disclosures that depict the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows pertaining to an entitys leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, using the cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption resulted in no material impact to the Companys balance sheet, results of operations, equity or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). Most notably, the new guidance requires that equity investments, with certain exemptions, be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income as opposed to other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018, as required, and reclassified $ 24 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. ##TABLE_START 3.

The Company held $2.0 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Companys investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds and dividend paying stocks, with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Companys investments included $ 1.5 billion and $ 0.9 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2018 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Available-for-Sale  Held-to-Maturity (in millions)  Amortized Cost  Fair Value  Amortized Cost  Fair Value Due in one year or less  $ 3,560  $ 3,551  $  $ Due after one year through five years  12,432  12,297   Due after five years through ten years  7,362  7,270   Due after ten years  2,563  2,570   U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities  4,947  4,852     Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities  1,376  1,358     Total debt securities  $ 32,240  $ 31,898  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of available-for-sale investments with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Less Than 12 Months  12 Months or Greater  Total (in millions)  Fair Value  Gross Unrealized Losses  Fair Value  Gross Unrealized Losses  Fair Value  Gross Unrealized Losses December 31, 2018             Debt securities - available-for-sale:             U.S. government and agency obligations  $  $ (7 )  $ 1,425  $ (35 )  $ 2,423  $ (42 ) State and municipal obligations  1,334  (11 )  2,491  (46 )  3,825  (57 ) Corporate obligations  8,105  (109 )  4,239  (109 )  12,344  (218 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities  1,296  (22 )  2,388  (84 )  3,684  (106 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   (7 )   (13 )  1,081  (20 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale  $ 12,355  $ (156 )  $ 11,002  $ (287 )  $ 23,357  $ (443 ) December 31, 2017             Debt securities - available-for-sale:             U.S. government and agency obligations  $ 1,249  $ (8 )  $ 1,027  $ (22 )  $ 2,276  $ (30 ) State and municipal obligations  2,599  (21 )   (14 )  3,465  (35 ) Corporate obligations  5,901  (23 )  1,242  (21 )  7,143  (44 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities  1,657  (12 )  1,162  (26 )  2,819  (38 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities   (3 )   (3 )   (6 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale  $ 11,817  $ (67 )  $ 4,441  $ (86 )  $ 16,258  $ (153 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2018 were generated from approximately 19,000 positions out of a total of 31,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. ##TABLE_START 4. Fair Value ##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: ##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inputs that are corroborated by other observable market data. ##TABLE_END Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. There was no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 . Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 . The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Companys internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds are estimated using valuation techniques that rely heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Companys processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on that understanding. Assets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt and equity securities. Long-Term Debt. The fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Companys investments in debt securities.

The Company has $3.5 billion five-year, $3.5 billion three-year and $3.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2023 , December 2021 and December 2019 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Companys commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Companys senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2018 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 3.2% to 3.6% . Debt Covenants The Companys bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_START 9. Income Taxes ##TABLE_END The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses.

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $99 million expire beginning in 2022 through 2037 and $17 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2019 through 2038. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2018 , the Companys undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)    Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period  $  $  $ Gross increases:       Current year tax positions    Prior year tax positions    Gross decreases:       Prior year tax positions  (84 )  (33 )  (4 ) Settlements  (20 )  (24 )  (6 ) Statute of limitations lapses  (12 )  (4 )  (12 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period  $ 1,056  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $118 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recognized $6 million , $14 million and $11 million of interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $95 million and $84 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2018 , there were $716 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Companys 2018 and 2017 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2012 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2013 and forward. ##TABLE_START 10. Shareholders' Equity ##TABLE_END Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions The Companys regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries in the United States are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. For both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion , including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. The Company's regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $23.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's regulated subsidiaries was approximately $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to be considered Well Capitalized under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2018 , the Company believes that Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered Well Capitalized. Share Repurchase Program Under its Board of Directors authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Companys capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2018, the Board renewed the Companys share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data)   Common share repurchases, shares   Common share repurchases, average price per share  $ 236.72  $ 173.54 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost  $ 4,500  $ 1,500 Board authorized shares remaining   ##TABLE_ENDDividends In June 2018, the Companys Board of Directors increased the Companys annual dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share compared to $3.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2017. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. ##TABLE_START 11. Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END The Companys outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options, SARs and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had 42 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan. As of December 31, 2018 , there were also 7 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Companys common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option and SAR exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options and SARs granted represents the period of time that the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. Other Employee Benefit Plans The Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2018, 2017 and 2016.  In addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus and receive certain Company contributions on such deferrals, subject to plan limitations. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $988 million and $865 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 12. Commitments and Contingencies ##TABLE_END The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. Rent expense under all operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $751 million , $710 million and $608 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions)  Future Minimum Lease Payments  $ 2020  2021  2022  2023  Thereafter  1,343 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had outstanding, undrawn letters of credit with financial institutions of $83 million and surety bonds outstanding with insurance companies of $1.3 billion , primarily to bond contractual performance. Pending Acquisition In December 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately $4.3 billion . Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Companys businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Companys businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Companys local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Companys health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblowers complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Companys motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Companys counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. Those motions were argued in September 2018. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. ##TABLE_START 13. Segment Financial Information ##TABLE_END Factors used to determine the Companys reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes that operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Companys four reportable segments derives its revenues: ##TABLE_START  UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community  State and UnitedHealthcare Global. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses and individuals nationwide. UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Community  States primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, the Childrens Health Insurance Program and other federal, state and community health care programs. UnitedHealthcare Global is a diversified global health services business with a variety of offerings, including international commercial health and dental benefits and health care delivery. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. OptumHealth serves the physical, emotional and health-related financial needs of individuals, enabling population health through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth offers access to networks of care provider specialists, health management services, care delivery, consumer engagement and financial services. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumInsight provides services, technology and health care expertise to major participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care industry depend on OptumInsight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  OptumRx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. ##TABLE_END The Companys accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and local care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned such that each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. As a percentage of the Companys total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 30% , 28% and 25% for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare  Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 96% , 96% and 97% of consolidated total revenues for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 76% and 77% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Global.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2018 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2018 Management of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2018 , the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2018. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP  Minneapolis, Minnesota February 12, 2019 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.
